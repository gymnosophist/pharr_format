        "0":"\n THE PROLOGUE \n \n \n THE HOUSEHOLD GOD \n Lest any one should wonder who I am, I will tell you in a few words. I am the household God of this family, from whose house you have seen me coming forth. It is now many years that I have been occupying this houses and I inhabited it for the father and the grandfather of this person who now dwells here. But beseeching me, his grandfather entrusted to me a treasure of gold, unknown to all. He deposited it in the midst of the hearth \n , praying me that I would watch it for him. He, when he died, was of such an avaricious disposition, that he would never disclose it to his own son, and preferred rather to leave him in want than to show that treasure to that son. He left him no large quantity of land, on which to live with great laboriousness and in wretchedness. When he died who had entrusted that gold to me, I began to take notice whether his son would any how pay greater honor to me than his father had paid me. But he was in the habit of venerating me still less and less by very much, and gave me a still less share of devotion. So in return was it done by me; and he likewise ended his life. He left this person who now dwells here, his son, of the same disposition as his father and grandfather were. He has an only daughter; she is always every day making offerings to me, either with incense, or wine, or something or other; she presents me, too, with chaplets. Out of regard for her, I have caused this Euclio to find this treasure, in order that he might more readily give her in marriage if he should wish; for a young man of very high rank has ravished her; this young man knows who it is that he has ravished; she knows him not, nor yet does her father know that she has been ravished. This day I shall cause the old gentleman here, our neighbour, to ask her as his wife; that will I do for this reason, that he may the more easily marry her who has ravished her. And this old gentleman who shall ask her as his wife, the same is the uncle of that young man who debauched her in the night time at the festival of Ceres \n \n . But this old fellow is now making an uproar in the house, as usual; he is thrusting the old woman out of doors, that she may not be privy to the secret. I suppose he wants to look at the gold, if it be not stolen.\n \n \n ",
        "1":"\n Enter EUCLIO, driving out STAPHYLA. \n \n EUCLIO \n Get out, I say, be off, get out; by my troth, you must budge out of this house here, you pryabout woman, with your inquisitive eyes. \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n Pray why are you beating me, wretched creature that I am? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n That you may be wretched, and that, curst as you are. you may pass a curst life, well befitting you. \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n But for what reason have you now pushed me out of the house? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Am I to be giving you a reason, you whole harvest of whips \n . Get away there from the door! There, do look, if you please, how she does creep along. But do you know how matters stand with you? If I just now take a stick or a whip in my hand, I'll quicken that tortoise pace for you. \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n O that the Gods would drive me to hang myself, rather indeed than that I should be a slave in your house on these terms! \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Hark how the hag is grumbling to herself! By my troth, you wretch, I'll knock out those eyes of yours, that you mayn't be able to watch me, what business I'm about. Get out pushes her with his hands -further yet! still further! further! There now, stand you there! By my faith, if you budge a finger's breadth, or a nail's width from that spot, or if you look back until I shall order you, i' faith, I'll give you up at once as a trainer for the gibbet. Aside. I know for sure that I did never see one more accursed than this hag, and I'm sadly in fear of her, lest she should be cheating me unawares, or be scenting it out where the gold is concealed, a most vile wretch, who has eyes in the back of her head as well. Now I'll go and see whether the gold is just as I concealed it, that so troubles wretched me in very many ways. He goes into his house. \n\n \n \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n By heavens, I cannot now conceive what misfortune, or what insanity, I am to say has befallen my master; in such a way does he often, ten times in one day, in this fashion push wretched me out of the house. I' faith, I know not what craziness does possess this man; whole nights is he on the watch; then, too, all the day long does he sit for whole days together at home like a lame cobbler \n . Nor can I imagine now by what means to conceal the disgrace of my master's daughter, whose lying-in approaches near; and there isn't anything better for me, as I fancy, than to make one long capital letter \n of myself, when I've tied up my neck in a halter.\n \n \n ",
        "2":"\n Enter EUCLIO, from his house. \n \n EUCLIO \n \n to himself . Now, with my mind at ease, at length I go out of my house, after I've seen that everything is safe in-doors. Now do you return at once into the house to STAPHYLA , and keep watch in-doors. \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n Keep watch in-doors upon nothing at all, forsooth! or is it, that no one may carry the house away. For here in our house there's nothing else for thieves to gain, so filled is it with emptiness \n and cobwebs. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n 'Tis a wonder that, for your sake, Jupiter doesn't now make me a King Philip, or a Darius \n , you hag of hags. I choose those cobwebs to be watched for me. I am poor, I confess it--I put up with it. What the Gods send, I endure. Go in-doors, shut to the door, I shall be there directly. Take you care not to let any strange person into the house. \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n What if any person asks for fire? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I wish it to be put out, that there may be no cause for any one asking it of you. But if the fire shall be kept in, you yourself shall be forthwith extinguished. Then do you say that the water has run out \n , if any one asks for it.\n \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n The knife, the hatchet, the pestle and mortar, utensils that neighbours are always asking the loan of---- \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Say that thieves have come and carried them off. In fact, in my absence, I wish no one to be admitted into my house; and this, too, do I tell you beforehand, if Good Luck should come, don't you admit her. \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n I' faith, she takes good care, I think, not to be admitted; for though close at hand \n , she has never come to our house. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Hold your tongue, and go in-doors. \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n I'll hold my tongue, and be off. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Shut the door, please, with both bolts. I shall be there directly. STAPHYLA goes into the house. I'm tormented in my mind, because I must go away from my house I' faith, I go but very unwillingly; but I know full well what I'm about; for the person that is our master of our ward \n has given notice that he will distribute a didrachm of silver to each man; if I relinquish that, and don't ask for it, at once I fancy that all will be suspecting that I've got gold at home; for it isn't very likely that a poor man would despise ever such a trifle, so as not to ask for his piece of money. For as it is, while I am carefully concealing it from all, lest they should know, all seem to know it, and all salute me more civilly than they formerly used to salute me; they come up to me, they stop, they shake hands \n ; they ask me how I am, what I'm doing, what business I'm about. Now I'll go there whither I had set out \n ; afterwards, I'll betake myself back again home as fast as ever I can.\n \n \n ",
        "3":"\n Enter EUNOMIA and MEGADORUS, from their house. \n \n EUNOMIA \n I could wish you, brother, to think that I utter these words by reason of my own regard and your welfare, as is befitting your own sister to do. Although I'm not unaware that we women are accounted troublesome; for we are all of us deservedly considered very talkative, and, in fact, they say at the present day that not a single woman has been found dumb \n in any age. Still, brother, do you consider this one circumstance, that I am your nearest relation, and you in like manner are mine. How proper it is that I should counsel and advise you, and you me, as to what we may judge for the interest of each of us; and for it not to be kept concealed or kept silence upon through apprehension, but rather that I should make you my confidant, and you me in like manner. For that reason, now, have I brought you here apart out of doors, that I might here discourse with you upon your private concerns. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Best of women, give me your hand. Takes her hand. \n \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n \n looking about . Where is she? Who, pray, is this best of women? \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Yourself. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n Do you say so? \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n If you say no, I say no. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n Indeed, it's right that the truth should be spoken; for the best of women can nowhere be found; one is only worse than another, brother. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I think the same, and I'm determined never to contradict you on that point, sister. What do you wish? \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n Give me your attention, I beg of you. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n 'Tis at your service; use and command me, please, if you wish for aught.\n \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n A thing that I consider very greatly for your advantage I'm come to recommend you. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Sister, you are doing after your usual manner. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n I wish it were done. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n What is it, sister? \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n That you may enjoy \n everlasting blessings in being the father of children. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n May the Gods so grant it. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n I wish you to bring home a wife. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Ha! I'm undone. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n How so? \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Because, sister, your words are knocking out the brains of unfortunate me; you are speaking stones \n . \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n Well, well, do this that your sister requests you. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n If she requests me, I will do it. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n 'Tis for your own interest. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Yes, for me to die before I marry. Let her who comes here to-morrow, be carried out \n of the house the day after, sister; on that condition, give me her whom you wish to give; get ready the nuptials. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n I am able, brother, to provide you with a wife with a very large marriage-portion. But she's somewhat aged; she's of the middle-age of woman. If you request me, brother, to ask her for you, I'll ask her. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Would you like me to ask you a question? \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n Yes, if you like, ask it. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Suppose any old man, past mid-age, brings home a middle-aged wife, if by chance he should have a child by this old woman, do you doubt at all but that the name of that child is Posthumus \n , all prepared? Now, sister, I'll remove and lessen this labour for you. I, by the merits of the Gods and of my forefathers, am rich enough; these high families, haughty pride \n , bountiful portions, acclamations, imperiousness, vehicles inlaid with ivory, superb mantles and purple, I can't abide, things that by their extravagance reduce men to slavery. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n Tell me, pray, who is she whom you would like to take for a wife? \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I'll tell you. Do you know that Euclio, the poor old man close by? \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n I know him; not a bad sort of man, i' faith. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I'd like his maiden daughter to be promised me in marriage. Don't make any words \n about it, sister; I know what you are going to say; that she's poor. This poor girl pleases me. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n May the Gods prosper it. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I hope the same. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n What do you want me now for? Do you wish for anything? \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Farewell. \n \n \n EUNOMIA \n And you the same, brother. Goes into the house. \n \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I'll go meet Euclio, if he's at home. But, see! the very person is betaking himself home, whence, I know not. \n \n ",
        "4":"\n Enter EUCLIO. \n \n EUCLIO \n \n to himself . My mind had a presentiment that I was going to no purpose when I left my house; and therefore I went unwillingly; for neither did any one of the wardsmen come, nor yet the master of the ward, who ought to have distributed the money. Now I'm making all haste to hasten home; for I myself am here, my mind's at home. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n \n accosting him . May you be well, and ever fortunate, Euclio! \n \n \n EUCLIO \n May the Gods bless you, Megadorus! \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n How are you? Are you quite well, and as you wish? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n \n aside . It isn't for nothing when a rich man accosts a poor man courteously; now this fellow knows that I've got some gold; for that reason he salutes me more courteously. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Do you say that you are well? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Troth, I'm not very well in the money line. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I' faith, if you've a contented mind, you have enough to passing a good life with. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n \n aside . By my faith, the old woman has made a discovery to him about the gold; 'tis clear it's all out. I'll cut off her tongue, and tear out her eyes, when I get home. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Why are you talking to yourself? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I'm lamenting my poverty; I've a grown-up girl without a portion, and one that can't be disposed of in marriage; nor have I the ability to marry her to anybody. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Hold your peace; be of good courage, Euclio: she shall be given in marriaye; you shall be assisted by myself. Say, if you have need of aught; command me. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n \n aside . Now is he aiming at my property, while he's making promises; he's gaping for my gold, that he may devour it; in the one hand he is carrying a stone \n . while he shows the bread in the other. I trust no person, who, rich himself, is exceedingly courteous to a poor man; when he extends his hand with a kind air, then is he loading you with some damage. I know these polypi \n , who, when they've touched a thing, hold it fast.\n \n \n \n MEG.( \n Give me your attention, Euclio, for a little time: I wish to address you in a few words, about a common concern of yours and mine. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n \n aside . Alas! woe is me! my gold has been grabbed from in-doors: now he's wishing for this thing, I'm sure, to come to a compromise with me; but I'll go look in my house. He goes towards his door. \n \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Where are you going? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I'll return to you directly, for there's something I must go and see to at home. He goes into his house. \n \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n By my troth, I do believe that when I make mention of his daughter, for him to promise her to me, he'll suppose that he's being laughed at by me; nor is there out of the whole class of paupers one more beggarly than he. EUCLIO returns from his house. \n \n \n \n EUCLIO \n \n aside . The Gods do favour me; my property's all safe. If nothing's lost, it's safe. I was very dreadfully afraid, before I went in-doors! I was almost dead! Aloud. I'm come back to you, Megadorus, if you wish to say anything tome. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I return you thanks; I beg that as to what I shall enquire of you, you'll not hesitate to speak out boldly. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n So long, indeed, as you enquire nothing that I mayn't choose to speak out upon. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Tell me, of what sort of family do you consider me to be sprung? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Of a good one. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n What think you as to my character? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n 'Tis a good one. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n What of my conduct? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Neither bad nor dishonest. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Do you know my years? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I know that they are plentiful, just like your money. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I' faith, for sure I really did always take you to be a citizen without any evil guile, and now I think you so. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n \n aside . He smells the gold. Aloud. What do you want with me now? \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Since you know me, and I know you, what sort of person you are--a thing, that may it bring a blessing on myself, and you and your daughter, I ask your daughter as my wife. Promise me that it shall be so. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Heyday! Megadorus, you are doing a deed that's not becoming to your usual actions, in laughing at me, a poor man, and guiltless towards yourself and towards your family For neither in act, nor in words, have I ever deserved it of you, that you should do what you are now doing. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n By my troth, I neither am come to laugh at you, nor am I laughing at you, nor do I think you deserving of it. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Why then do you ask for my daughter for your self? \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n That through me it may be better for you, and through you and yours for me. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n This suggests itself to my mind, Megadorus, that you are a wealthy man, a man of rank; that I likewise am a person, the poorest of the poor; now, if I should give my daughter in marriage to you, it suggests itself to my mind that you are the ox, and that I am the ass; when I'm yoked to you, and when I'm not able to bear the burden equally with yourself, I, the ass, must lie down in the mire; you, the ox, would regard me no more than if I had never been born; and I should both find you unjust, and my own class would laugh at me; in neither direction should I have a fixed stall, if there should be any separation \n ; the asses would tear me with their teeth, the oxen would butt at me with their horns. This is the great hazard, in my passing over from the asses to the oxen. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n The nearer you can unite yourself in alliance with the virtuous, so much the better. Do you receive this proposal, listen to me, and promise her to me. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n But indeed there is no marriage-portion. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n You are to give none; so long as she comes with good principles, she is sufficiently portioned. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I say so for this reason, that you mayn't be supposing that I have found any treasures.\n \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I know that; don't enlarge upon it. Promise her to me. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n So be it. Starts and looks about. But, O Jupiter , am I not utterly undone? \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n What's the matter with you? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n What was it sounded just now as though it were iron? \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Here at my place, I ordered them to dig up the garden. EUCLIO runs off into his house. But where is this man? He's off, and he hasn't fully answered me; he treats me with contempt. Because he sees that I wish for his friendship, he acts after the manner of mankind. For if a wealthy person goes to ask a favour of a poorer one, the poor man is afraid to treat with him; through his apprehension he hurts his own interest. The same person, when this opportunity is lost, too late, then wishes for it. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n \n coming out of the house, addressing STAPHYLA within . By the powers, if I don't give you up to have your tongue cut out by the roots, I order and I authorize you to hand me over to any one you please to be incapacitated. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n By my troth, Euclio, I perceive that you consider me a fit man for you to make sport of in my old age, for no deserts of my own. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I' faith, Megadorus, I am not doing so, nor, should I desire it, had I the means \n . \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n How now? Do you then betroth your daughter to me? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n On those terms, and with that portion which I mentioned to you. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n Do you promise her then? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I do promise her. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n May the Gods bestow their blessings on it. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n May the Gods so do. Take you care of this, and remember that we've agreed, that my daughter is not to bring you any portion.\n \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I remember it. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n But I understand in what fashion you, of your class, are wont to equivocate; an agreement is no agreement, no agreement is an agreement, just as it pleases you. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I'll have no misunderstanding with you. But what reason is there why we shouldn't have the nuptials this day? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Why, by my troth, there is very good reason for them. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n I'll go, then, and prepare matters. Do you want me in any way? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n That shall be done. Fare you well. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n \n going to the door of his house and calling out . Hallo ! Strobilus, follow me quickly, in all haste, to the fleshmarket. (Exit MEGADORUS.) \n \n \n \n EUCLIO \n He has gone hence. Immortal Gods, I do beseech you! How powerful is gold! I do believe, now, that he has had some intimation that I've got a treasure at home; he's gaping for that; for the sake of that has he persisted in this alliance. \n \n ",
        "5":"\n EUCLIO, alone. \n \n EUCLIO \n \n going to the door of his house, he opens it, and calls to STAPHYLA within . Where are you who have now been blabbing to all my neighbours that I'm going to give a portion to my daughter? Hallo ! Staphyla, I'm calling you! Don't you hear? Make haste in-doors there, and wash the vessels clean. I've promised my daughter in marriage; to-day I shall give her to be married to Megadorus here.\n from the house. \n \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n \n as she enters . May the Gods bestow their blessings on it! But, i' faith, it cannot be; 'tis too sudden. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Hold your tongue, and be off. Take care that things are ready when I return home from the Forum, and shut the house up. I shall be here directly. (Exit.) \n \n \n \n STAPHYLA \n What now am I to do? Now is ruin near at hand for us, both for myself and my master's daughter; for her disgrace and her delivery are upon the very point of becoming known; that which even until now has been concealed and kept secret, cannot be so now. I'll go in-doors, that what my master ordered may be done when he comes. But, by my faith, I do fear that I shall have to drink of a mixture of bitterness \n ! (Exit.) \n \n \n ",
        "6":"\n Enter STROBIOUS, ANTHRAX, and CONGRIO, with MUSIC GIRLS and PERSONS carrying provisions. \n \n STROBILUS \n After my master had bought the provisions, and hired the cooks \n and these music- girls in the market-place, he ordered me to divide these provisions into two parts. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n By my troth, but you really shan't be dividing me \n , I tell you plainly. If you wish me to go anywhere whole, I'll do my best. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n A very pretty and modest fellow, indeed \n . As if, when you are a conger by name, you wouldn't like to be cut into pieces. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n But, Anthrax, I said that in another sense, and not in the one which you are pretending. \n \n \n STROBILUS \n Now my master's going to be married to-day. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n Whose daughter is he to marry? \n \n \n STROBILUS \n The daughter of this Euclio, his near neighbour here. For that reason he has ordered half of these provisions here to be presented to him--one cook, and one music-girl likewise. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n That is, you take one half to him, the other half home?\n \n \n \n STROBILUS \n 'Tis just as you say. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n How's that? Couldn't this old fellow provide from his own resources for the wedding of his daughter. \n \n \n STROBILUS \n Pshaw! \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n What's the matter? \n \n \n STROBILUS \n What's the matter, do you ask? A pumice stone isn't so dry as is this old fellow. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n Do you really say that it is as you affirm? \n \n \n STROBILUS \n Do be judge yourself. Why, he's for ever crying out for aid from Gods and men, that his property has gone, and that he is ruined root and branch, if the smoke by chance escapes out of doors through the rafters of his house. Why, when he goes to sleep, he ties a bag \n beneath his gullet. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n Why so? \n \n \n STROBILUS \n That when he sleeps, he may lose no breath. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n And does he stop up the lower part of his windpipe \n as well, lest, perchance, he should lose any breath as he sleeps? \n \n \n STROBILUS \n In that 'tis as fair that you should credit me, as it is for me to credit you. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n Why really, I do believe you. \n \n \n STROBILUS \n But, further, do you know how it is? I' faith, he grieves to throw away the water when he washes. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n Do you think a great talent \n might be begged of this old fellow for him to give us, through which we might become free? \n \n \n STROBILUS \n By my troth, if you were to ask it, he would never let you have the loan of hunger. Why, the other day, the barber had cut his nails \n ; he collected all the parings, and carried them off.\n \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n I' faith, you do describe a miserably stingy wretch. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n But do you think that he does live so very stingily and wretchedly? \n \n \n STROBILUS \n A kite, the other day, carried off his morsel of food; the fellow went crying to the Prætor \n ; there, weeping and lamenting, he began to request that he might be allowed to compel the kite to give bail. There are innumerable other things that I could mention, if I had the leisure. But which of you two is the sharper? Tell me. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n I--as being much the better one. \n \n \n STROBILUS \n A cook I ask for, not a thief \n . \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n As a cook, I mean. \n \n \n STROBILUS \n \n to ANTHRAX . What do you say? \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n I'm just as you see me.\n \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n He's a nine-day cook \n ; every ninth day he's in the habit of going out to cook. \n \n \n ANTHRAX \n You, you three-lettered fellow \n ; do you abuse me, you thief? \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n To be sure I do, you trebly-distilled thief of thieves \n .\n \n \n ",

Then I began to think with myself upon the road, \"If you are guilty of any extravagance on a festive day, you may be wanting on a common day, unless you are saving.\" After I disclosed this reasoning to my heart and appetite, my mind came over to my opinion, that I ought to give my daughter in marriage at as little expense as possible. Now I've bought a bit of frankincense, and these chaplets of flowers; these shall be placed upon the hearth for our household God, that he may grant a propitious marriage to my daughter.

I've communicated to many friends my design about this proposal; they speak in high terms of the daughter of Euclio. They say that it was discreetly done, and with great prudence. But, in my opinion, indeed, if the other richer men were to do the same, so as to take home as their wives, without dower, the daughters of the poorer persons, both the state would become much more united, and we should meet with less ill feeling than we now meet with; both, they, the wives, would stand in fear of punishment more than they do stand in fear of it, and we husbands should be at less expense than we now are. In the greater part of the people this is a most just way of thinking; in the smaller portion there is an objection among the avaricious, whose avaricious minds and insatiate dispositions there is neither law nor magistrate to be able to put a check upon. But a person may say this; \"How are these rich women with portions to marry, if this law is laid down for the poor?\" Let them marry whom they please, so long as the dowry isn't their companion. If this were so done, the women would acquire for themselves better manners for them to bring, in place of dowry, than they now bring. I'd make mules, which exceed horses in price, to become cheaper than Gallic geldings \n .\n \n \n \n EUCLIO \n \n aside . So may the Gods favour me, I listen to him with delight; very shrewdly has he discoursed on the side of economy. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n \n to himself .

How thoroughly he does understand the doings of the wives! I wish he were made Prefect of the manners of the women. \n \n \n MEGADORUS \n \n to himself . Now, go where you will, you may see more carriages \n among the houses than in the country when you go to a farm-house. But this is even light, in comparison with when they ask for their allowance; there stands the scourer \n , the embroiderer, the goldsmith, the woollen-manufacturer, retail dealers in figured skirts \n , dealers in women's under-clothing , dyers in flame-colour, dyers in violet, dyers in wax- colour \n , or else sleeve-makers \n , or perfumers ; wholesale linendrapers, shoemakers, squatting cobblers, slipper-makers; sandasmakers stand there; stainers in mallow colour stand there; hairdressers make their demands, botchers their demands; boddice-makers \n stand there; makers of kirtles take their stand. Now you would think them got rid of; these make way, others make their demands; three hundred duns \n are standing in your hall; weavers, lace-makers \n , cabinet-makers , are introduced; the money's paid them. You would think them got rid of by this; when dyers in saffroncolours come sneaking along; or else there's always some horrid plague or other which is demanding something. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n \n aside .

You go, your account is being made up with your banker \n ; the tax-gatherer waits, half-starved, and thinks the money will be paid. When the account has been made up with the banker, even already is the husband himself in debt to the banker, and the hopes of the tax-gatlherer are postponed to another day. These, and many others, are the inconveniences and intolerable expenses of great portions; but she who is without portion is in the power of her husband; the portioned ones overwhelm their husbands with loss and ruin.

For if this is lawful, so that you may be able to excuse it--let us openly, in broad daylight, plunder their golden trinkets from ladies--after that, if we are caught, let us excuse ourselves, that we did it when intoxicated, by reason of being in love. Too cheap are wine and love, if one in liquor and in love is allowed to do with impunity whatever he pleases. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n But I come to you of my own accord to supplicate you on account of my folly. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Persons don't please me, who, when they've done wrong, excuse themselves.

Come, give it me back! I would rather give you the one-half of it. Although you are a thief to me, I'll not be hard upon the thief. Give it me back. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n You are not in your senses, to call me a thief; I thought, Euclio, that you had come to the knowledge of another matter; as concerns myself, it is a great matter which I wish to speak with you upon at your leisure, if you are at leisure. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Tell me, in good faith, have you not stolen that gold? \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n In good faith, No. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Nor know who has taken it away? \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n In good faith, No, to that as well. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n But if you should know who has taken it away, will you discover it to me? \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n I will do so. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Nor accept of a share from him, whoever he is, for yourself, nor harbour the thief? \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n Even so. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n What if you deceive me? \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n Then may great Jupiter do unto me what he pleases. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I'm satisfied. Come, then, say what you wish. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n If you know me but imperfectly, of what family I'm born: Megadorus here is my uncle; Antimachus was my father; my name is Lyconides; Eunomia is my mother.\n \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I know the family; now, what do you want? \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n I want to know this. You have a daughter of yours? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Why, yes, she's there at home. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n You have, I think, recently betrothed her to my uncle? \n \n \n EUCLIO \n You have the whole matter. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n He has now bade me announce to you his refusal of her \n . \n \n \n EUCLIO \n A refusal, when the things are got ready, and the wedding's prepared? May all the immortal Gods and Goddesses confound him, so far as is possible, by reason of whom this day, unhappy wretch that I am, I have lost so much gold! \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n Be of good heart, and speak in kindly terms; now, a thing--may it turn out well and prosperously to you and your daughter.--May the Gods so grant--say. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n May the Gods so grant. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n And for me, too, may the Gods so grant it. Now, then, do you listen. The man that admits a fault is not so much to be despised, if he feels a sense of shame when he excuses himself. Now, Euclio, I do beseech you, that what unawares I have done wrong towards yourself or your daughter, you will grant me pardon for the same, and give her for a wife to me, as the laws demand. I confess that I did violence to your daughter on the festival of Ceres , by reason of wine and the impulse of youth. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n Woe is me! What shocking deed do I hear of you? \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n Why do you exclaim? You whom I've made to be a grandfather now at the very wedding of your daughter. For your daughter has just been brought to bed in the ninth month after--calculate the number \n ; for that reason, in my behalf, has my uncle sent his refusal. Go in-doors; enquire whether it is so or not as I say. \n \n \n EUCLIO \n I'm undone utterly; so very many misfortunes unite themselves for my undoing. I'll go in-doors, that I may know what of this is true. He goes into his house. \n \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n I'll follow you this instant. This matter seems now to be pretty nearly in the haven of safety. Now, where to say my servant Strobilus is, I don't know, but yet I'll wait here still a little while; after that I'll follow this man indoors; now, in the meantime, I'll give him leisure to enquire of the nurse about my doings, the attendant of his daughter, whether she knows the truth.

But why do I delay to rush upon the jaws of this rascal, and why this instant do I not compel his soul to take its journey before its time ? Are you going to give it me or not? \n \n \n STROBILUS \n I will give it you. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n I want you to give it me now, and not at a future time. \n \n \n STROBILUS \n I'll give it now; but I entreat you to allow me to recover breath.

Then, what you wish for you cannot get. But if you had only allured me by the reward of dear liberty, you would already have obtained your wish. Nature produces all men free, and by nature all desire freedom. Slavery is worse than every evil, than every calamity; and he whom Jupiter hates, him he first makes a slave. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n You speak not unwisely \n \n \n STROBILUS \n Now then hear the rest. Our age has produced masters too grasping, whom I'm in the habit of calling Harpagos, Harpies, and Tantali, poor amid great wealth, and thirsty in the midst of the waters of Ocean; no riches are enough for them, not those of Midas, not of Crœsus; not all the wealth of the Persians can satisfy their Tartarean maw. Masters use their slaves rigorously, and slaves now obey their masters but tardily; so on neither side is that done which would be fair to be done. Their provisions, kitchens, and store-cellars, avaricious old fellows shut up with a thousand keys. Slaves, thievish, doubledealers, and artful, open for themselves things shut up with a thousand keys, which the owners hardly like to be granted to their lawful children, and stealthily do they carry off, consume, and lick them up--fellows that will never disclose their hundred thefts even at the gibbet; thus in laughter and joking do bad slaves take revenge upon their slavery. So then, I come to the conclusion that liberality renders slaves faithful. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n Rightly, indeed, have you spoken, but not in a few words, as you promised me. But if I do make you free, will you give me back what I'm asking for? \n \n \n STROBILUS \n I will give it back; but I wish for witnesses to be present; you'll pardon me, master, I trust you but little. \n \n \n LYCONIDES \n Just as you please; let there be present even a hundred; then I shouldn't care about it. \n \n \n STROBILUS \n \n going to the door of the house of MEGADORUS .

I always thought that to be in want of gold was the worst thing for both boys and men, and all old people. Indigence compels boys to be guilty of misdeeds, men to thieve, and old men themselves to become beggars. But 'tis much worse, as I now see, to abound in gold beyond what's necessary for us. Alas! what miseries has Euclio endured on account of the pot, that a little while since was lost by him! \n \n \n EUCLIO \n To whom shall I give deserved thanks? Whether to the Gods, who show regard for good men, or to my friends, upright men, or to them both? Rather to both, I think; and first to you, Lyconides, the origin and author of so great a good; you do I present with this pot of gold; accept it with pleasure.
