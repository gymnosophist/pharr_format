For in dealing with a case we first ask\nwhat the accused intended to do, next what he was\nin a position to do, and lastly what he actually did.\nConsequently the first point on which we must fix\nour attention is the character of the accused. It is\nthe business of the accuser to make any charge that\n\n\n\nhe may bring against the accused not merely discreditable, but as consistent as possible with the\ncrime for which he is arraigned. For example, if\nhe calls a man accused of murder a debauchee or\nan adulterer, the discredit attaching to such charges\nwill no doubt tell against the accused, but will, on\nthe other hand, do less to prove the case than if\nhe shows him to be bold, insolent, cruel or reckless.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the defence must,\nas far as possible, aim at denying, excusing or\nextenuating such charges, or, if that be impossible,\nshow that they are not relevant to the case. For\nthere are many charges which not only have no\nmutual resemblance, but may even at times contradict each other, as for instance if a man accused\nof theft is called prodigal or careless. For it is\nnot likely that one and the same man should at\nonce despise money and covet it. If such means\nof defence are not available, we must take refuge\nwith the plea that the charges made are not\nrelevant to the case, that because a man has committed certain sins, it does not follow that he has\ncommitted all, and that the accusers ventured to\nmake such false charges merely because they hoped\nby injuring and insulting the accused to be able\nto overwhelm him with the unpopularity thus\ncreated. There are also other topics which arise\nfrom and against the statement of the case by the\nprosecution. The defence may begin by drawing\narguments from the person involved, and will at\ntimes urge on general grounds that it is incredible\nthat a father has been killed by his son or that a\ncommander has betrayed his country to the enemy.\nThe answer to such arguments is easy, for we may\n\n\n\nurge that bad men are capable of every crime, as\nis shown by every-day occurrences, or that the\natrocious nature of a crime is but a poor argument\nagainst its having been committed. At times we\nmay base our arguments on the special circumstances\nof the person involved. This may be done in various\nways: rank, for example, may be pleaded in defence\nof the accused, or at times, on the other hand, may\nbe employed to prove his guilt on the ground that\nhe trusted to his rank to secure impunity. Similarly\npoverty, humble rank, wealth may be used as arguments for or against the accused according to the\ntalent of the advocate. Upright character, however,\nand the blamelessness of his past life are always of\nthe utmost assistance to the accused. If no charge\nis made against his character, counsel for the defence\nwill lay great stress on this fact, while the accuser\nwill attempt to restrict the judge to the sole consideration of the actual issue which the court has\nto decide, and will say that there must always be\na first step in crime and that a first offence is not\nto be regarded as the occasion for celebrating a\nfeast in honour of the defendant's character. So\nmuch for the methods of reply which will be employed by the prosecution. But he will also in his\nopening speech endeavour to dispose the judges to\nbelieve that it is not so much that he is unable,\nas that he is unwilling to bring any charge against\nthe character of the accused. Consequently it is\nbetter to abstain from casting any slur on the past\nlife of the accused than to attack him with slight\nor frivolous charges which are manifestly false,\nsince such a proceeding discredits the rest of\nour argument. Further, the advocate who brings\n\n\n\nno charges against the accused may be believed to\nhave omitted all reference to past offences on the\nground that such reference was not necessary, while\nthe advocate who heaps up baseless charges thereby\nadmits that his only argument is to be found in the\npast life of the accused, and that he has deliberately\npreferred to risk defeat on this point rather than\nsay nothing at all about it.

If any of these motives can be\nplausibly alleged against the accused, it is the duty\nof the accuser to make it appear that such motives\nmay lead a man to commit any crime, and to exaggerate the particular motives which he selects for\nthe purpose of his argument. If no such motive can\nbe alleged, he must take refuge in suggesting that\nthere must have been some hidden motive, or in\nasserting that, if he committed the act, all enquiry\ninto motive is irrelevant or that a motiveless crime\nis even more abominable than one which has a\nmotive. Counsel for the defence, on the other hand,\nwill, wherever it be possible, emphasise the point\nthat it is incredible that any act should be committed\nwithout a motive. Cicero develops this point with\ngreat energy in a number of his speeches, but more\nespecially in his defence of Varenus, who had everything else against him and was as a matter of fact\ncondemned. But if the prosecution do allege some\nmotive, he will either say that the motive alleged is\n\n\n\nfalse or inadequate or unknown to the accused. For\nit is possible that a man may be quite ignorant of\nmotives imputed to him. He may not, for example,\nhave known whether the man whom he is accused\nof having killed had appointed him his heir\nor intended to prosecute him. All else failing,\nwe may urge that motives are not necessarily of\nimportance.

For instance, the\nquestion may arise whether a man caught in a\nbrothel with another man's wife is an adulterer.\nHere there is no doubt about the name; it is the\nsignificance of the act which is in doubt, since the\nquestion is whether he has committed any sin at all.\nFor if he has sinned, his sin can only be adultery.\nThere is a different type of question where the\ndispute is concerned with the term to be applied,\nwhich depends on the letter of the law: it is a form\nof question which can only arise in the courts from\nthe actual words on which the dispute turns. Take\nas examples the questions, whether suicide is a form\nof homicide, or whether the man who forces a tyrant\nto kill himself can be considered a tyrannicide, or\nwhether magical incantations are equivalent to the\ncrime of poisoning. In all these cases there is no\ndoubt about the facts, for it is well known that there\nis a difference between killing oneself and killing\nanother, between slaying a tyrant and forcing him\nto suicide, between employing incantations and\nadministering a deadly draught, but we enquire\nwhether we are justified in calling them by the\nsame name."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cp."}, "#text": "III. vi. 31."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cp."}, "#text": "VIII.

For example,\nin the  each part has its own special place,\nfirst, second and third, etc., while each question and\ntopic requires to be suitably arranged, and the same\nis true even of isolated  For it will\nnot, I imagine, be represented that sufficient skill\nin division is possessed by the man who, after resolving a controversial theme into questions such as\nthe following, whether a hero is to be granted any\nreward that he may claim, whether he is allowed to\nclaim private property, whether he may demand any\nwoman in marriage, whether he may claim to marry\na woman who already possesses a husband, or this\nparticular woman,  although it is his duty to\ndeal with the first question first, proceeds to deal\nwith them indiscriminately as each may happen to\noccur to him, and ignores the fact that the first\npoint which should be discussed is whether we\nshould stand by the letter or the intention of the\nlaw, and fails to follow the natural order, which\ndemands that after beginning with this question he\nshould then proceed to introduce the subsidiary\nquestions, thereby making the structure of his speech\n\n\n\nas regular as that of the human body, of which, for\nexample, the hand is a part, while the fingers are\nparts of the hand, and the joints of the fingers.

It is\nthe duty of the teacher to demonstrate daily in one\nkind of case after another what is the natural order\nand connexion of the parts, so that little by little\nhis pupils may gain the experience which will enable\nthem to deal with other cases of the same character.\nFor it is quite impossible to teach everything that\ncan be accomplished by art. For example, what\npainter has ever been taught to reproduce everything\nin nature? But once he has acquired the general\nprinciples of imitation, he will be able to copy whatever is given him.

But\nhe will not be able to communicate to his pupil the\ngift of feeling the pulse, or appreciating the variations\nof colour, breathing and temperature: this will\ndepend on the talent of the individual. Therefore,\nin most instances, we must rely on ourselves,\nand must study cases with the utmost care, never\n\n\n\nforgetting that men discovered our art before ever\nthey proceeded to teach it. For the most effective,\nand what is justly styled most  arrangement of a case as a whole, is that which cannot be\ndetermined except when we have the specific facts\nbefore us. It consists in the power to determine\nwhen the  is necessary and when it should\nbe omitted; when we should make our statement of\nfacts continuous, and when we should subdivide it;\nwhen we should begin at the very beginning, when,\nlike Homer, start at the middle or the end; when\nwe should omit the statement of facts altogether;\nwhen we should begin by dealing with the arguments\nadvanced by our opponents, and when with our own;\nwhen we should place the strongest proofs first and\nwhen the weakest; in what cases we should prefix\n to the  and what preparation is\nnecessary to pave the way for these questions; what\narguments the judge will accept at once, and to\nwhat he requires to be led by degrees; whether we\nshould refute our opponent's arguments as a whole\nor in detail; whether we should reserve emotional\nappeals for the peroration or distribute them throughout the whole speech; whether we should speak first\nof law or of equity; whether we should first advance\n(or refute) charges as to past offences or the charges\nconnected with the actual trial; or, again, if the\ncase is complicated, what order we should adopt,\nwhat evidence or documents of any kind should\nbe read out in the course of our speech, and what\nreserved for a later stage. This gift of arrangement\nis to oratory what generalship is to war. The skilled\ncommander will know how to distribute his forces\n\n\n\nfor battle, what troops he should keep back to\ngarrison forts or guard cities, to secure supplies, or\nguard communications, and what dispositions to make\nby land and by sea. But to possess this gift, our\norator will require all the resources of nature, learning\nand industrious study. Therefore let no man hope\nthat he can acquire eloquence merely by the labour\nof others. He must burn the midnight oil, persevere\nto the end and grow pale with study: he must form\nhis own powers, his own experience, his own\nmethods: he must not require to hunt for his\nweapons, but must have them ready for immediate\nuse, as though they were born with him and not\nderived from the instruction of others. The road\nmay be pointed out, but our speed must be our\nown. Art has done enough in publishing the\nresources of eloquence, it is for us to know how to\nuse them. And it is not enough merely to arrange\nthe various parts: each several part has its own\ninternal economy, according to which one thought\nwill come first, another second, another third, while\nwe must struggle not merely to place these thoughts\nin their proper order, but to link them together and\ngive them such cohesion that there will be no trace\nof any suture: they must form a body, not a congeries\nof limbs. This end will be attained if we note what\nbest suits each position, and take care that the words\nwhich we place together are such as will not clash,\nbut will mutually harmonise. Thus different facts\nwill not seem like perfect strangers thrust into\nuncongenial company from distant places, but will\nbe united with what precedes and follows by an\nintimate bond of union, with the result that our\n\n\n\nspeech will give the impression not merely of having\nbeen put together, but of natural continuity.

I wished also to show that its subject matter\nconsists of everything on which an orator may be\ncalled to speak, and is, as a rule, to be found in three\nclasses of oratory, demonstrative, deliberative, and\nforensic; that every speech is composed of matter\nand words, and that as regards matter we must\n\n\n\nstudy invention, as regards words, style, and as\nregards both, arrangement, all of which it is the\ntask of memory to retain and delivery to render\nattractive. I attempted to show that the duty of\nthe orator is composed of instructing, moving and\ndelighting his hearers, statement of facts and argument falling under the head of instruction, while\nemotional appeals are concerned with moving the\naudience and, although they may be employed\nthroughout the case, are most effective at the beginning and end. As to the element of charm, I\npointed out that, though it may reside both in facts\nand words, its special sphere is that of style. I\nobserved that there are two kinds of questions, the\none indefinite, the other definite, and involving the\nconsideration of persons and circumstances of time\nand place; further, that whatever our subject matter, there are three questions which we must ask,  and  To this I\nadded that demonstrative oratory consists of praise\nand denunciation, and that in this connexion we\nmust consider not merely the acts actually performed by the person of whom we were speaking,\nbut what happened after his death. This task I\nshowed to be concerned solely with what is honourable or expedient. I remarked that in deliberative\noratory there is a third department as well which\ndepends on conjecture, for we have to consider\nwhether the subject of deliberation is possible or\nlikely to happen. At this point I emphasised the\nimportance of considering who it is that is speaking,\nbefore whom he is speaking, and what he says.

I proceeded\nto show that questions must turn either on something written or something done: in the latter\ncase we have to consider the truth of the facts\ntogether with their special character and quality;\nin the former we consider the meaning or the\nintention of the words, with reference to which we\nusually examine the nature of all cases, criminal or\ncivil, which fall under the heads of the  and\n the  or \nI went on to point out that in all forensic cases the\nspeech consists of five parts, the  designed\nto conciliate the audience, the \ndesigned to instruct him, the  which confirms\nour own propositions, the  which overthrows\nthe arguments of our opponents, and the \nwhich either refreshes the memory of our hearers\nor plays upon their emotions. I then dealt with the\nsources of arguments and emotion, and indicated\nthe means by which the judges should be excited,\nplacated, or amused. Finally I demonstrated the\nmethod of division. But I would ask that the\nstudent who is really desirous of learning should\nbelieve that there are also a variety of subjects with\nregard to which nature itself should provide much\nof the requisite knowledge without any assistance\nfrom formal teaching, so that the precepts of which\nI have spoken may be regarded not so much as\n\n\n\nhaving been discovered by the professors of rhetoric\nas having been noted by them when they presented\nthemselves."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "17"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Or."}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}], "#text": "xxi. 94."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Or."}, "#text": "Cic.  xiv. 44;"}], "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "eloqui"}, "pb": {"@id": "p.187"}, "#text": "The points which follow require greater care and\nindustry. For I have now to discuss the theory of\nstyle, a subject which, as all orators agree, presents\nthe greatest difficulty. For Marcus Antonius, whom\nI mentioned above, states that lie has seen many\ngood, but no really eloquent speakers, and holds\nthat, while to be a good speaker it is sufficient to\nsay what is necessary, only the really eloquent\nspeaker can do this in ornate and appropriate language. And if this excellence was to be found in\nno orator up to his own day, and not even in himself\nor Lucius Crassus, we may regard it as certain that\nthe reason why they and their predecessors lacked\nthis gift was its extreme difficulty of acquisition.\nAgain, Cicero holds that, while invention and\narrangement are within the reach of any man of\ngood sense, eloquence belongs to the orator alone,\nand consequently it was on the rules for the cultivation of eloquence that he expended the greatest\ncare. That he was justified in so doing is shown\nclearly by the actual name of the art of which I am\nspeaking. For the verb  means the production\nand communication to the audience of all that the\nspeaker has conceived in his mind, and without this\npower all the preliminary accomplishments of oratory\nare as useless as a sword that is kept permanently\nconcealed within its sheath.

The\nmain reason for this is that those words are best\nwhich are least far-fetched and give the impression\nof simplicity and reality. For those words which are\nobviously the result of careful search and even seem to\nparade their self-conscious art, fail to attain the grace\nat which they aim and lose all appearance of sincerity\nbecause they darken the sense and choke the good\nseed by their own luxuriant overgrowth. For in\nour passion for words we paraphrase what might be\nsaid in plain language, repeat what we have already\n\n\n\nsaid at sufficient length, pile up a number of words\nwhere one would suffice, and regard allusion as\nbetter than directness of speech. So, too, all\ndirectness of speech is at a discount, and we think no\nphrase eloquent that another could conceivably have\nused. We borrow figures and metaphors from the\nmost decadent poets, and regard it as a real sign\nof genius that it should require a genius to understand our meaning. And yet Cicero long since\nlaid down this rule in the clearest of language, that\nthe worst fault in speaking is to adopt a style inconsistent with the idiom of ordinary speech and\ncontrary to the common feeling of mankind. But\nnowadays our rhetoricians regard Cicero as lacking\nboth polish and learning; we are far superior, for\nwe look upon everything that is dictated by nature\nas beneath our notice, and seek not for the true\nornaments of speech, but for meretricious finery, as\nthough there were any real virtue in words save in\ntheir power to represent facts. And if we have to\nspend all our life in the laborious effort to discover\nwords which will at once be brilliant, appropriate\nand lucid, and to arrange them with exact precision,\nwe lose all the fruit of our studies. And yet we see\nthe majority of modern speakers wasting their time\nover the discovery of single words and over the\nelaborate weighing and measurement of such words\nwhen once discovered. Even if the special aim of\nsuch a practice were always to secure the best words,\nsuch an ill-starred form of industry would be much\nto be deprecated, since it checks tile natural current\nof our speech and extinguishes the warmth of\nimagination by the delay and loss of self-confidence\nwhich it occasions. For the orator who cannot\n\n\n\nendure to lose a single word is like a man plunged\nin griping poverty. On the other hand, if he will\nonly first form a true conception of the principles of\neloquence, accumulate a copious supply of words by\nwide and suitable reading, apply the art of arrangement to the words thus acquired, and finally, by\ncontinual exercise, develop strength to use his\nacquisitions so that every word is ready at hand\nand lies under his very eyes, he will never lose a\nsingle word. For the man who follows these instructions will find that facts and words appropriate\nto their expression will present themselves spontaneously. But it must be remembered that a long\ncourse of preliminary study is necessary and that\nthe requisite ability must not merely be acquired,\nbut carefully stored for use; for the anxiety devoted\nto the search for words, to the exercise of the\ncritical faculty and the power of comparison is in its\nplace while we are learning, but not when we are\nspeaking. Otherwise, the orator who has not given\nsufficient attention to preliminary study will be like\na man who, having no fortune, lives from hand to\nmouth. If, on the other hand, the powers of speech\nhave been carefully cultivated beforehand, words\nwill yield us ready service, not merely turning up\nwhen we search for them, but dwelling in our\nthoughts and following them as the shadow follows\nthe body. There are, however, limits even to this\nform of study; for when our words are good Latin,\nfull of meaning, elegant and aptly arranged, why\nshould we labour further?

Some orators fall into serious error\nin their eagerness to avoid this fault, and are afraid\nof all words that are in ordinary use, even although\nthey may be absolutely necessary for their purpose.\nThere was, for example, the man who in the course\nof a speech spoke of  a meaningless\nphrase intelligible only to himself. Cassius Severus,\nhowever, by way of deriding his affectation, explained\nthat he meant Spanish broom.

Consequently  turns\nnot on the actual term, but on the meaning of the\nterm, and must be tested by the touchstone of the\nunderstanding, not of the ear. The second sense\nin which the word  is used occurs when\nthere are a number of things all called by the same\nname: in this case the original term from which\nthe others are derived is styled the  term.\n\n\n\nFor example, the word  means a whirl of\nwater, or of anything else that is whirled in a like\nmanner: then, owing to the fashion of coiling the\nhair, it comes to mean the top of the head, while\nfinally, from this sense it derives the meaning of\nthe highest point of a mountain.

Our\nown writers have ventured on a few attempts at\ncomposition and derivation, but have not met with\n\n\n\nmuch success.

Many new words have been\ncoined in imitation of the Greeks, more especially\nby Verginius Flavus, some of which, such as  and\n are regarded as unduly harsh.

It consists firstly\nin forming a clear conception of what we wish to\nsay, secondly in giving this adequate expression,\nand thirdly in lending it additional brilliance, a\nprocess which may correctly be termed embellishment. Consequently we must place among ornaments\nthat  which I mentioned in the rules which\nI laid down for the statement of facts, because vivid\nillustration, or, as some prefer to call it, representation, is something more than mere clearness, since\nthe latter merely lets itself be seen, whereas the\nformer thrusts itself upon our notice. It is a great\ngift to be able to set forth the facts on which\nwe are speaking clearly and vividly. For oratory\nfails of its full effect, and does not assert itself\nas it should, if its appeal is merely to the hearing,\nand if the judge merely feels that the facts\non which he has to give his decision are being\nnarrated to him, and not displayed in their living\ntruth to the eyes of the mind. But since different\nviews have been held with regard to this art of\nrepresentation, I shall not attempt to divide it into\n\n\n\nall its different departments, whose number is\nostentatiously multiplied by certain writers, but\nshall content myself with touching on those which\nappear to me to be absolutely necessary. There is,\nthen, to begin with, one form of vividness which consists in giving an actual word-picture of a scene, as\nin the passage beginning,\n\n\n\nOther details follow which give us such a picture\nof the two boxers confronting each other for the\nfight, that it could not have been clearer had we\nbeen actual spectators. Cicero is supreme in this\ndepartment, as in others. Is there anybody so incapable of forming a mental picture of a scene that,\nwhen he reads the following passage from the\nVerrines, he does not seem not merely to see the\nactors in the scene, the place itself and their very\ndress, but even to imagine to himself other details\nthat the orator does not describe?  For my own\npart, I seem to see before my eyes his face, his eyes,\nthe unseemly blandishments of himself and his paramour, the silent loathing and frightened shame of\nthose who viewed the scene. At times, again, the\npicture which we endeavour to present is fuller in\ndetail, as, for example, in the following description\nof a luxurious banquet, which is also from Cicero,\nsince he by himself is capable of supplying admirable\nexamples of every kind of oratorical ornament:  What more\nwould any man have seen who had actually entered\nthe room? So, too, we may move our hearers to\ntears by the picture of a captured town. For the\nmere statement that the town was stormed, while\nno doubt it embraces all that such a calamity involves, has all the curtness of a dispatch, and fails\nto penetrate to the emotions of the hearer. But if\nwe expand all that the one word  includes,\nwe shall see the flames pouring from house and\ntemple, and hear the crash of falling roofs and one\nconfused clamour blent of many cries: we shall\nbehold some in doubt whither to fly, others clinging\nto their nearest and dearest in one last embrace,\nwhile the wailing of women and children and the\nlaments of old men that the cruelty of fate should\nhave spared them to see that day will strike upon\nour ears. Then will come the pillage of treasure\nsacred and profane, the hurrying to and fro of the\nplunderers as they carry off their booty or return to\nseek for more, the prisoners driven each before his\nown inhuman captor, the mother struggling to keep\nher child, and the victors fighting over the richest\nof the spoil. For though, as I have already said,\nthe sack of a city includes all these things, it is less\neffective to tell the whole news at once than to\nrecount it detail by detail. And we shall secure\nthe vividness we seek, if only our descriptions give\nthe impression of truth, nay, we may even add\nfictitious incidents of the type which commonly\noccur. The same vivid impression may be produced\n\n\n\nalso by the mention of the  of each\nsituation:\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\nThough the attainment of such effects is, in my\nopinion, the highest of all oratorical gifts, it is far\nfrom difficult of attainment. Fix your eyes on nature\nand follow her.

My motive in using this term\nwas, however, this, that this form of amplification\nproduces its effect at a point other than that where\nit is actually introduced. One thing is magnified\nin order to effect a corresponding augmentation elsewhere, and it is by reasoning that our hearers are\nthen led on from the first point to the second which\nwe desire to emplasise. Cicero, when he is about\nto reproach Antony with his drunkenness and\nvomiting, says,  etc. What have his throat\nand flanks to do with his drunkenness? The\nreference is far from pointless: for by looking at\nthem we are enabled to estimate the quantity of\n\n\n\nthe wine which he drank at Hippias' wedding, and\nwas unable to carry or digest in spite of the fact\nthat his bodily strength was worthy of a prizefighter. Accordingly if, in such a case, one thing is\ninferred from another, the term  is neither\nimproper nor extraordinary, since it has been\napplied on similar grounds to one of the \nSo, again, amplification results from subsequent\nevents, since the violence with which the wine\nburst from him was such that the vomiting was\nnot accidental nor voluntary, but a matter of\nnecessity, at a moment when it was specially unseemly, while the food was not recently swallowed,\nas is sometimes the case, but the residue of the revel\nof the preceding day. On the other hand,  may equally result from antecedent circumstances; for example, when Juno made her request\nto Aeolus, the latter\n\nwhereby the poet shows what a mighty tempest will\nensue. Again, when we have depicted some horrible\ncircumstance in such colours as to raise the detestation of our audience to its height, we then proceed\nto make light of them in order that what is to follow\nmay seem still more horrible: consider the following\npassage from Cicero:  Does\n\n\n\nnot the orator employ a process of reasoning to\nenable the audience to infer how great the implied\ncrime must be when such actions were but humane\nand ordinary in comparison? So, again, one thing\nmay be magnified by allusion to another: the valour\nof Scipio is magnified by extolling the fame of\nHannibal as a general, and we are asked to marvel\nat the courage of the Germans and the Gauls in\norder to enhance the glory of Gaius Caesar. There\nis a similar form of  which is effected by\nreference to something which appears to have been\nsaid with quite another purpose in view. The chiefs\nof Troy think it no discredit that Trojan and Greek\nshould endure so many woes for so many years all\nfor the sake of Helen's beauty. How wondrous,\nthen, must her beauty have been! For it is not\nParis, her ravisher, that says this; it is not some\nyouth or one of the common herd; no, it is the\nelders, the wisest of their folk, the counsellors of\nPriam. Nay, even the king himself, worn out by a\nten years' war, which had cost him the loss of so many\nof his sons, and threatened to lay his kingdom in the\ndust, the man who, above all, should have loathed\nand detested her beauty, the source of all those\ntears, hears these words, calls her his daughter, and\nplaces her by his side, excuses her guilt, and denies\nthat she is the cause of his sorrows. Again, when\nPlato in the Symposium makes Alcibiades confess\nhow he had wished Socrates to treat him, he does\nnot, I think, record these facts with a view to\nblaming Aleibiades, but rather to show the unconquerable self-control of Socrates, which would\nnot yield even to the charms which the greatest\nbeauty of his day so frankly placed at his disposal.\n\n\n\nWe are even given the means of realising the\nextraordinary stature of the heroes of old by the\ndescription of their weapons, such as the shield of\nAjax and the spear-shaft of Achilles hewn in the\nforests of Pelion. Virgil also has made admirable\nuse of this device in his description of the Cyclops.\nFor what an image it gives us of the bulk of that\nbody\n\n\n\nSo, too, what a giant must Demoleos have been,\nWhose\n\n\n\nAnd yet the hero buckled it upon him and\n\n\n\nAnd again, Cicero could hardly even have conceived of such luxury in Antony himself as he\ndescribes when he says,  Slaves\nare using purple coverlets in their chambers, aye,\nand coverlets that had once been Pompey's!

For great effect may\nbe produced by dwelling on a single point, and by\nsetting forth our facts in such a striking manner\nthat they seem to be placed before the eyes as\nvividly as if they were taking place in our actual\npresence. This is especially effective in stating a\ncase or for the purpose of illuminating and amplifying the facts in course of statement, with a view to\nmaking our audience regard the point which we\namplify as being as important as speech can make\nit. On the other hand, as opposed to this procedure\nwe may often give a rapid summary, suggest more\nthan is actually said, may express ourselves tersely\nin short, clean-cut sentences and disparage, or, what\nis much the same, mock our opponent in a manner\nnot inconsistent with the precepts given us by Caesar.\nOr we may employ digressions and then, after thus\ndelighting our audience, make a neat and elegant\nreturn to our main theme. We may set forth in\nadvance what we propose to say, mark off the topics\nalready treated from those which are to follow,\nreturn to our point, repeat it and draw our formal\n\n\n\nconclusions. Again, with a view to augmenting\nor attenuating the force of some point, we may\nexaggerate and overstate the truth: we may ask\nquestions, or, what is much the same, enquire of\nothers and set forth our own opinion. There is also\navailable the device of dissimulation, when we say\none thing and mean another, the most effective of\nall means of stealing into the minds of men and a\nmost attractive device, so long as we adopt a conversational rather than a controversial tone. Hesitation may be expressed between two alternatives,\nour statement may be distributed in groups or we\nmay correct ourselves, either before or after we have\nsaid something or when we repel some allegation\nagainst ourselves. We may defend ourselves by\nanticipation to secure the success of some point\nwhich we propose to make or may transfer the blame\nfor some action to another. We may confer with\nour audience, admitting them as it were into our\ndeliberations, may describe the life and character\nof persons either with or without mention of their\nnames, a device which is one of the greatest embellishments of oratory and specially adapted to\nconciliate the feelings, as also frequently to excite\nthem. Again by the introduction of fictitious\npersonages we may bring into play the most forcible\nform of exaggeration. We may describe the results\nlikely to follow some action, introduce topics to lead\nour hearers astray, move them to mirth or anticipate\nthe arguments of our opponent. Comparisons and\nexamples may be introduced, both of them most\neffective methods; we may divide, interrupt, contrast,\nsuppress, commend. Our language may be free or\neven unbridled with a view to heighten our effects,\n\n\n\nwhile anger, reproach, promises that we shall prove\nour case, entreaty, supplication, slight deviations\nfrom our proposed course (which must be distinguished from the longer digressions mentioned\nabove), exculpation, conciliation, personal attacks,\nwishes and execrations are all of value.

The principle governing the use of embellishments and decorations of\nstyle is the same: words may be repeated and\nreiterated or reproduced with some slight change.\nSentences may repeatedly commence or end with\n\n\n\nthe same word or may begin and end with the same\nphrase. The same word may be reiterated either at\nthe beginning or at the conclusion, or may be repeated,\nbut in a different sense. Words may have the same\ninflexion or termination or be placed in various\nantitheses, our language may rise by gradations to a\nclimax, or a number of words may be placed together\nin asyndeton without connecting particles. Or we\nmay omit something, while making clear the reason\nfor such omission, or correct ourselves with apparent\ncensure of our carelessness, may utter exclamations of\nadmiration or grief, or introduce the same word\nrepeatedly in different cases. The ornaments of\nthought are, however, more important. They are so\nfrequently employed by Demosthenes that some\ncritics have held that it is in them that the chief\nbeauty of his style resides. And in truth there is\nhardly a topic in his speeches which is not distinguished by some artificial treatment of the thought,\nand it must be admitted that speaking involves the\nembellishment of all, or at any rate most of our\nthoughts with some form of ornament. As you,\nBrutus, have such an admirable knowledge of all\nthese methods, it would be waste of time for me to\ncite all their names or to give illustrations. I shall\ntherefore content myself merely with indicating this\ntopic. Our ideal orator then will speak in such a\nmanner that he will cast the same thought into a\nnumber of different forms, will dwell on one point\nand linger over the same idea. he will often attenuate some one point or deride his opponent, will\ndiverge from his theme and give a bias to his thought,\nwill set forth what he intends to say, after completing his argument will give a brief summary, will\n\n\n\nrecall himself to the point which he has left, repeat\nwhat he has said, complete his proof by a formal\nconclusion, embarrass his opponent by asking questions or answer himself in reply to imaginary\nquestions; will desire his words to be taken in a\ndifferent sense from their literal meaning, will\nhesitate what argument or form of statement to\nprefer, will classify and divide, will deliberately\nomit and ignore some point, and defend himself\nby anticipation; will transfer the blame of some\ncharge brought against him to his opponent, will\noften take his audience, and sometimes even his\nopponent into consultation, will describe the character\nand talk of particular persons, will put words into\nthe mouths of inanimate objects, divert the minds of\nthe audience from the point at issue, often move\nthem to merriment or laughter, anticipate objections,\nintroduce comparisons, cite precedents, assign and\ndistribute different sentiments to different persons,\nsilence interrupters, assert that there are certain\nthings of which he prefers not to speak, warn his\naudience to be on their guard against certain things,\nor venture on a certain licence of speech. Again, he\nwill wax angry, sometimes indulge in rebuke, entreaty or supplication, will clear away unfavourable\nimpressions, swerve a little from his point, utter\nwishes or execrations, or address his audience in\nterms of familiar intimacy. There are also other\nvirtues at which he should aim, such as brevity, if his\ntheme demands it, while he will often set forth topics\nin such vivid language as almost to present them to\nthe very eyes of his audience, or will exaggerate his\nsubject beyond the bounds of possibility. His meaning will frequently be deeper than his words seem to\n\n\n\nindicate, his tone will often be cheerful, and he will\noften mimic life and character.

What pleasure can an orator hope to produce, or what impression even of the most moderate\nlearning, unless he knows how to fix one point in the\nminds of the audience by repetition, and another by\ndwelling on it, how to digress from and return to his\ntheme, to divert the blame from himself and transfer\nit to another, or to decide what points to omit and\nwhat to ignore as negligible?

But the conditions governing the\nemployment of figures differ in the two cases. For\nwe may speak against the tyrants in question as\nopenly as we please without loss of effect, provided always that what we say is susceptible of a\ndifferent interpretation, since it is only danger to\nourselves, and not offence to them, that we have to\navoid.

On the other\nhand, the actual business of the courts has never\nyet involved such necessity for silence, though at\ntimes they require something not unlike it, which\nis much more embarrassing for the speaker, as, for\nexample, when he is hampered by the existence of\npowerful personages, whom he must censure if\nhe is to prove his case. Consequently he must\nproceed with greater wariness and circumspection;\nsince the actual manner in which offence is given\nis a matter of indifference, and if a figure is perfectly\nobvious, it ceases to be a figure. Therefore such\ndevices are absolutely repudiated by some authorities, whether the meaning of the figure be intelligible or not.

In doing this we shall find emotional\nappeals, hesitation and words broken by silences\nmost effective.

I\nmyself have come across persons whom it was impossible to convince by other means: I have even\ncome across a much rarer thing, namely, a case\nwhich could only be proved by recourse to such\ndevices. I was defending a woman who was alleged\nto have forged her husband's will, and the heirs\nwere stated to have given a bond to the husband\non his deathbed, which latter assertion was true.\nFor since the wife could not legally be appointed\n\n\n\nhis heir, this procedure was adopted to enable the\nproperty to be transferred to her by a secret conveyance in trust. Now it was easy for me to secure\nthe woman's acquittal, by openly mentioning the\nexistence of the bond; but this would have involved\nher loss of the inheritance. I had, therefore, to plead\nin such a way that the judges should understand that\nthe bond had actually been given, but that informers\nmight be unable to avail themselves of any statement of mine to that effect. And I was successful\nin both my aims. The fear of seeming to boast my\nown skill would have deterred me from mentioning\nthis case, but for the fact that I wished to demonstrate that there was room for the employment of\nthese  even in the courts.

Further,\nin such cases speakers fall into the frequent error of\nassuming that certain persons say one thing and\nmean another: this is more especially the case where\nit is assumed that a man asks permission to die.\nTake, for example, the following controversial theme.\n  they say, \nFor my part, I laugh at the fears which they manifest\non his behalf, as though they were in peril of death\nthemselves, and at the way in which they allow their\nterror to influence their line of pleading; for they\nforget how many precedents there are for suicide\nand how many reasons there may be why a hero\nturned deserter should wish for death. But it would\nbe waste of time to expatiate on one controversial\ntheme. I would lay it down as a general rule that an\norator should never put forward a plea that is tantamount to collusion, and I cannot imagine a lawsuit\narising in which both parties have the same design,\nnor conceive that any man who wishes to live could\nbe such a fool as to put forward an absurd plea for\ndeath, when he might refrain from pleading for it at\nall. I do not, however, deny that there are controversial themes of this kind where  may\nlegitimately be employed, as, for example, the\nfollowing:  For in this case he does not pardon his son\nentirely, but cannot openly withdraw the evidence\nthat he gave in the first trial, and while he does not\ninflict any worse penalty than disinheritance, he does\nnot shrink from that. Further, the employment of\nthe  tells more heavily against the father than\nis fair and less against the son. But, while no one\never speaks against the view which he wishes to\nprevail, he may wish something of greater importance than what he actually says. Thus the\ndisinherited son who asks his father to take back\nanother son whom he had exposed, and who had\nbeen brought up by himself, on payment for his\nmaintenance, while he may prefer that he himself\nshould be reinstated, may all the same be perfectly\nsincere in his demand on behalf of his brother.\nAgain, a kind of tacit hint may be employed, which,\nwhile demanding the utmost rigour of the law from\nthe judges, suggests a loophole for clemency, not\nopenly, for that would imply a pledge on our part,\nbut by giving a plausible suspicion of our meaning.\nThis device is employed in a number of controversial\nthemes, among them the following.  Here if the father pledges himself to\npardon him, the dispute falls to the ground. If, on\nthe other hand, he holds out no hope of pardon,\nthough he will not necessarily be regarded as mad,\nhe will certainly give the impression of cruelty and\nwill prejudice the judge against him. Latro\n\n\n\ntherefore showed admirable skill when he made the son\nsay,  and the father reply,\n The elder Gallio treats the theme\nwith greater tenderness, as was natural to a man of\nhis disposition. He makes the father say,  Akin to this are those  of\nwhich the Greeks are so fond, by means of which\nthey give gentle expression to unpleasing facts.\nThemistocles, for example, is believed to have urged\nthe Athenians to commit their city to the protection\nof heaven, because to urge them to abandon it would\nhave been too brutal an expression. Again the\nstatesman who advised that certain golden images\nof Victory should be melted down as a contribution\nto the war funds, modified his words by saying that\nthey should make a proper use of their victories.\nBut all such devices which consist in saying one\nthing, while intending something else to be understood, have a strong resemblance to"}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "93"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "94"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "95"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "figures"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "figures"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "figures"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "figures"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "figures"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.435"}, "quote": "Swear by\nthe ashes of your father,", "note": "See v. vi. 1.

If, on the other hand, he\nstrains after them overmuch, he will lose that very\ncharm of variety which they confer. Some figures,\nhowever, are so generally accepted that they have\nalmost ceased to be regarded as figures: consequently\nhowever frequently they may be used, they will\nmake less impression on the ear, just because it has\nbecome habituated to them. For abnormal \nlying outside the range of common speech, while\nthey are for that very reason more striking, and\nstimulate the ear by their novelty, prove cloying if\nused too lavishly, and make it quite clear that they\ndid not present themselves naturally to the speaker,\nbut were hunted out by him, dragged from obscure\ncorners and artificially piled together.\n then, may be found in connexion with the\ngender of nouns; for we find \n(blind moles) and  (timid deer) in Virgil;\nbut there is good reason for this, since in these\ncases both sexes are covered by a word of one gender,\nand there is no doubt that there are male moles\nand deer as well as female.  may also affect\nverbs: for example, we find such phrases  or  This is the less\nsurprising, since the nature of verbs is such that we\noften express the active by the passive form, as in the\ncase of  (think) and  (suspect), and\nthe passive by the active, as in the case of \n(am beaten).

Again, the end may correspond with the\nbeginning.  There is also\nanother form of repetition which simultaneously\nreiterates things that have already been said, and\ndraws distinctions between them.\n\n\n\nThis is styled  by the Greeks and \nby Roman writers.

Here they are:  and  and again this jest from Ovid,\n\n\n\nCornificius calls this  that is the transference of the meaning of one word to another. It\nhas, however, greater elegance when it is employed\nto distinguish the exact meanings of things, as in the\nfollowing example: \nthe same is true when the meaning of verbs is reversed\nby a change in the preposition with which they are\ncompounded: for example,  The effect is better\nstill and more emphatic when our pleasure is derived\nboth from the figurative form and the excellence of\nthe sense, as in the following instance:  A more trivial effect is produced by\nthe following:  and  while phrases such as  or  are the worst of all. It does, however,\nsometimes happen that a bold and vigorous conception may derive a certain charm from the contrast\nbetween two words not dissimilar in sound. I do\n\n\n\nnot know that there is any reason why modesty\nshould prevent me from illustrating this point from\nmy own family. My father, in the course of a declamation against a man who had said he would die\non his embassy and then returned after a few days'\nabsence without accomplishing anything, said,  For the\nsense is forcible and the sound of the two words,\nwhich are so very different in meaning, is pleasant,\nmore especially since the assonance is not far fetched,\nbut presents itself quite naturally, one word being of\nthe speaker's own selection, while the other is supplied by his opponent. The old orators were at\ngreat pains to achieve elegance in the use of words\nsimilar or opposite in sound. Gorgias carried the\npractice to an extravagant pitch, while Isocrates, at\nany rate in his early days, was much addicted to it.\nEven Cicero delighted in it, but showed some restraint in the employment of a device which is not\nunattractive save when carried to excess, and, further,\nby the weight of his thought lent dignity to what\nwould otherwise have been mere trivialities. For\nin itself this artifice is a flat and foolish affectation,\nbut when it goes hand in hand with vigour of\nthought, it gives the impression of natural charm,\nwhich the speaker has not had to go far to find.\nThere are some four different forms of play upon\nverbal resemblances. The first occurs when we\nselect some word which is not very unlike another,\nas in the line of Virgil\n\n\n\nor,  and \n\n\n\n Or at any rate the words selected will be\nof equal length and will have similar terminations,\nas in  A good effect may also\nbe produced by an artifice such as the following, so\nlong as the thought which it expresses be vigorous: \nThe name commonly applied to this is \nthough the Stoic Theon thinks that in cases of\n the correspondence between the clauses must\nbe exact. The second form occurs when clauses\nconclude alike, the same syllables being placed at\nthe end of each; this correspondence in the ending\nof two or more sentences is called \nHere is an example: \nThis figure is usually, though not invariably, found in\nthe groups of three clauses, styled  of which\nthe following may be cited as an illustration: \nBut the device may be applied to four clauses or\nmore. The effect may even be produced by single\nwords; for example, \nor  In the third form the\ncorrespondence is produced by the use of similar\ncases; it is known as  But this name,\nthough it implies a certain similarity, does not necessarily involve identity in termination, since it means\nno more than similarity of case, irrespective of the\nfact that words may be differently declined, and does\nnot always occur at the end of a sentence; the correspondence may occur at the beginning, middle or\n\n\n\nend of clauses, or may be varied so that the middle\nof one clause corresponds with the beginning of\nanother and the end with the middle: in fact, any\narrangement of correspondences is permissible. Nor\nneed the words which correspond consist of the\nsame number of syllables. For example, we find\nthe following sentence in Domitius Afer:   The best form of this\nfigure is that in which the beginnings and ends of\nthe clauses correspond (as in this case  corresponds with  and  with ), in such\na way that there is a close resemblance between the\nwords, while cadence and termination are virtually\nidentical.

Now though I am ready to admit that more\n may perhaps be discovered by certain\nwriters, I cannot agree that such figures are better\nthan those which have been laid down by high\nauthorities. Above all I would point out that\nCicero has included a number of figures in the third\nbook of the  which in his later work, the\nOrator, he has omitted, thereby seeming to indicate\nthat he condemned them. Some of these are  rather than  such as meiosis, the\nintroduction of the unexpected, imagery, answering\nour own questions, digression, permission, arguments drawn from opposites (for I suppose that by\n\n\n\n he means what is elsewhere styled\n), and proof borrowed from an opponent.\nThere are some again which are not figures at all,\nsuch as arrangement, distinction by headings, and\ncircumscription, whether this latter term be intended\nto signify the concise expression of thought or\ndefinition, which is actually regarded by Cornificius\nand Rutilius as a  With regard to\nthe elegant transposition of words, that is,  which Caecilius also thinks is a  I have\nincluded it among  As for  of the\nkind which Rutilius calls  its function is to\npoint out the differences between men, things and\ndeeds: if it is used on an extended scale, it is not a\n if on a narrower scale, it is mere  while\nif it is intended to mean  enough has already\nbeen said on the subject. Again what sort of a\nfigure is this \nwhich Rutilius calls ? It may also be\ndoubted whether the  with which Rutilius opens his discussion of figures, is really a figure. He calls it\n and states that strictly it applies to a\nnumber of propositions, since the reason is either\nattached to each proposition separately, as in the\nfollowing passage from Gaius Antonius: ; or, after two or three propositions have\nbeen stated, the reasons for them may be given continuously in the same order, as for example in the\n\n\n\nwords that Brutus uses of Gnaeus Pompeius:  But a\nnumber of reasons may also be assigned for one statement, as in the lines of Virgil:\n\n\n\nAs to what Cicero means by  I am in the\ndark: if he means  or  or  I have already discussed them.

If by this they mean that only that\nis natural which originated with nature and has\nnever received any subsequent cultivation, there is\nan end to the whole art of oratory. For the first\nmen did not speak with the care demanded by that\nart nor in accordance with the rules that it lays\n\n\n\ndown. They knew nothing of introducing their\ncase by means of an exordium, of instructing the\njury by a statement of facts, of proving by argument\nor of arousing the emotions. They lacked all these\nqualifications as completely as they lacked all knowledge of the theory of artistic structure. But if\nthey were to be forbidden all progress in this\nrespect, they ought equally to have been forbidden\nto exchange their huts for houses, their cloaks of\nskin for civilised raiment and their mountains and\nforests for cities. What art was ever born fullgrown? What does not ripen with cultivation?\nWhy do we train the vine? Why dig it? We clear\nthe fields of brambles, and they too are natural products of the soil. We tame animals, and yet they\nare born wild. No, that which is most natural is\nthat which nature permits to be done to the greatest\nperfection. How can a style which lacks orderly\nstructure be stronger than one that is welded together\nand artistically arranged? It must not be regarded\nas the fault of the study of structure that the employment of feet consisting of short syllables such as\ncharacterise the Sotadean and Galliambic metres\nand certain prose rhythms closely resembling them in\nwildness, weakens the force of our matter. Just as\nriver-currents are more violent when they run along a\nsloping bed, that presents no obstacles to check their\ncourse, than when their waters are broken and baffled\nby rocks that obstruct the channel, so a style which\nflows in a continuous stream with all the full development of its force is better than one which is rough\nand broken. Why then should it be thought that\npolish is inevitably prejudicial to vigour, when the\ntruth is that nothing can attain its full strength\n\n\n\nwithout the assistance of art, and that art is always\nproductive of beauty? Is it not the fact that grace\nalways goes with the highest skill in throwing the\nspear, and that the truer the archer's aim, the more\ncomely is his attitude? Again in fencing and all\nthe contests of the wrestling school, what one of all\nthe tricks of attack and defence is there, that does\nnot require movements and firmness of foot such as\ncan only be acquired by art? Consequently in my\nopinion artistic structure gives force and direction\nto our thoughts just as the throwing-thong and the\nbowstring do to the spear and the arrow. And\nfor this reason all the best scholars are convinced\nthat the study of structure is of the utmost value,\nnot merely for charming the ear, but for stirring\nthe soul. For in the first place nothing can penetrate to the emotions that stumbles at the portals of\nthe ear, and secondly man is naturally attracted by\nharmonious sounds. Otherwise it would not be the\ncase that musical instruments, in spite of the fact\nthat their sounds are inarticulate, still succeed in\nexciting a variety of different emotions in the hearer.\nIn the sacred games different methods are employed\nto excite and calm the soul, different melodies are\nrequired for the war-song and the entreaty sung by\nthe suppliant on bended knee, while the war-note\nof the trumpet that leads the army forth to battle\nhas no resemblance to the call that sounds the\nretreat. It was the undoubted custom of the Pythagoreans, when they woke from slumber, to rouse\ntheir souls with the music of the lyre, that they\nmight be more alert for action, and before they\nretired to rest, to soothe their minds by melodies\nfrom the same instrument, in order that all\n\n\n\nrestlessness of thought might be lulled to orderly repose.\nBut if there is such secret power in rhythm and\nmelody alone, this power is found at its strongest in\neloquence, and, however important the selection\nof words for the expression of our thoughts, the\nstructural art which welds them together in the\nbody of a period or rounds them off at the close,\nhas at least an equal claim to importance. For\nthere are some things which, despite triviality of\nthought and mediocrity of language, may achieve\ndistinction in virtue of this excellence alone. In\nfact, if we break up and disarrange any sentence\nthat may have struck us as vigorous, charming or\nelegant, we shall find that all its force, attraction\nand grace have disappeared. Cicero in his \nbreaks up some of his own utterances in this way:\n and so on. Disarrange\nthese periods in such a manner, and you will find\nthat the shafts you have hurled are broken or wide\nof the mark. Cicero also corrects passages in the\nspeeches of Gracchus where the structure appears to\nhim to be harsh. For Cicero this is becoming enough,\nbut we may content ourselves with testing our own\npower of welding together in artistic form the disconnected words and phrases which present themselves\nto us. For why should we seek elsewhere for\nexamples of faults which we may all of us find in\nour own work? One point, however, it is enough\nsimply to noticethat the more beautiful in thought\nand language the sentence which you deprive of\nsuch structural cohesion, the more hideous will\n\n\n\nbe the effect upon the style, for the very brilliance\nof the words at once exposes the carelessness of\ntheir arrangement. Accordingly, although I admit\nthat artistic structure, at any rate in perfection,\nwas the last accomplishment to be attained by\noratory, I still hold that even primitive orators\nregarded it as one of the objects of their study, as\nfar at least as the rudeness of their attainments\npermitted. For even Cicero for all his greatness\nwill never persuade me that Lysias, Herodotus and\nThucydides were careless in this respect. They\nmay not perhaps have pursued the same ideals as\nDemosthenes and Plato, and even these latter\ndiffered in their methods. For it would never have\ndone to spoil the fine and delicate texture of Lysias\nby the introduction of richer rhythms, since he\nwould thus have lost all that surpassing grace which\nhe derives from his simple and unaffected tone,\nwhile he would also have sacrificed the impression\nof sincerity which he now creates. For it must be\nremembered that he wrote his speeches for others\nto deliver, so that it was right that they should\nsuggest a lack of form and artistic structure: indeed\nhis success in producing this effect actually shows his\nmastery of structure. Again history, which should\nmove with speed and impetuosity, would have been\nill-suited by the halts imposed by the rounding off\nof the period, by the pauses for breath inevitable\nin oratory, and the elaborate methods of opening\nsentences and bringing them to a close. It is however true that in the speeches inserted by historians\nwe may note something in the way of balanced\ncadences and antitheses. As regards Herodotus,\nwhile his flow, in my opinion, is always gentle, his\n\n\n\ndialect has such a sweetness of its own that it even\nseems to contain a certain rhythmical power hidden\nwithin itself. However I shall speak of the different\nideals a little later: my immediate task is to teach\nthe student elementary rules which are essential if\ncorrectness of structure is to be attained."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "hiatus"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "comma,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "incisum,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "colon,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "menbrum,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "period,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ambitus, circumductum, continuatio"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "conclusio."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "order, connexion"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "rhythm."}], "note": {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "comma, colon, period,"}, "#text": "See  122;  now applied to stops,\noriginally referred to varying lengths of clauses or sentences."}, "#text": "There are then in the first place two kinds of\nstyle: the one is closely welded and woven together,\nwhile the other is of a looser texture such as is\nfound in dialogues and letters, except when they\ndeal with some subject above their natural level,\nsuch as philosophy, politics or the like.

Words taken singly are\nknown as  (unconnected). In dealing with\nthem we must take care that our style does not\ndiminish in force through the fact that a weaker\nword is made to follow a stronger: as, for example,\nif after calling a man a despoiler of temples we were\nto speak of him as a thief, or after styling him a\nhighwayman were to dub him an insolent fellow.\nFor sentences should rise and grow in force: of this\nan excellent example is provided by Cicero, where\nhe says, ; for there each phrase is\nfollowed by one stronger than the last, whereas, if\nhe had begun by referring to his whole body, he\ncould scarcely have gone on to speak of his lungs\nand throat without an anticlimax. There is also\nanother species of order which may be entitled\nnatural, as for example when we speak of    in\npreference to the reverse order. In some cases a\nchange in the order will make a word superfluous:\nfor example, we write  rather than\n (twin-brothers), since if  came\nfirst, there would be no necessity to add  The\nrule which some have sought to enforce that nouns\nshould precede verbs, and verbs adverbs, while\nepithets and pronouns should follow their substantives, is a mere extravagance, since the reverse\norder is often adopted with excellent effect. Another\npiece of extravagant pedantry is to insist that the\nfirst place should always be occupied by what is first\n\n\n\nin order of time: such an order is no doubt often the\nbest, but merely because previous events are often the\nmost important and should consequently be placed\nbefore matters of more trivial import. If the demands\nof artistic structure permit, it is far best to end the\nsentence with a verb: for it is in verbs that the\nreal strength of language resides. But if it results\nin harshness of sound, this principle must give way\nbefore the demands of rhythm, as is frequently the\ncase in the best authors of Rome and Greece. Of\ncourse, in every case where a verb does not end the\nsentence, we shall have an  but \nis an admitted  or  and therefore is to be\nregarded as an adornment. For words are not cut\nto suit metrical feet, and are therefore transferred\nfrom place to place to form the most suitable combinations, just as in the case of unhewn stones their\nvery irregularity is the means of suggesting what\nother stones they will best fit and what will supply\nthem with the surest resting-place. On the other\nhand, the happiest effects of language are produced\nwhen it is found possible to employ the natural\norder, apt connexion and appropriate rhythm. Some\ntranspositions are too long, as I have pointed out in\nprevious books, while at times they involve faulty\nstructure, although some writers actually aim at this\nvicious type of transposition, in order to create an\nappearance of freedom and license, as in the following phrases from Maecenas, ; ;  The worst\nfeature in these examples, is that he plays pranks\n\n\n\nwith his structure while dealing with a sad theme.\nIt is, however, not infrequently possible to give\nspecial significance to a word by placing it at the\nclose of the sentence and thereby stamping and\nimpressing it on the mind of the hearer, whereas if\nit were placed in the middle of the sentence, it\nwould remain unnoticed, escape the attention and be\nobscured by its surroundings; the following passage\nfrom Cicero will illustrate what I mean:  Transfer the last word to some other position\nand the effect will be decreased. For the whole\npassage is made to converge to a point at the end;\nthe disgraceful circumstance of his being forced to\nvomit has been mentioned and the audience expect\nnothing more, when the orator adds yet a further\nrevolting feature of the case, namely that he was\nstill unable to retain his food the day after the\ncarouse. Domitius Afer was in the habit of transferring words at the cadence of the sentence solely\nfor the purpose of harshening his rhythm, more\nespecially in his  as, for example, in his\ndefence of Cloatilla, where he says  and in his defence of Laelia, where he\nsays, \nTo such an extent did he avoid the voluptuous\neffect of soft and delicate rhythm, that he actually\ninterposed obstacles to break the natural harmonies\nof his language. There is a further drawback resulting from the faulty arrangement of words, with\nwhich we are all familiar, namely, that it leads to\nambiguity. The above remarks will, I think, suffice\nas a brief summary of the points which require\nnotice in connexion with order.

Again, there are occasions when vowels\nclash. When this happens, the language is broken\nby gaps and interstices and seems to labour.

The measure of verse on the other\nhand is quite different; the  (u u _) or \n(_ _) cannot be substituted at will for the  nor\nis it a matter of indifference whether the \nbegins or ends with short syllables.

Again rhythm more readily\nadmits of  although they are found in metre as\nwell.

For example, I have\ncome across tiresome grammarians who attempted to\nforce prose into definite metres, as though it were a\nspecies of lyric poetry. Cicero, indeed, frequently\nasserts that the whole art of prose-structure consists\nin rhythm and is consequently censured by some\ncritics on the ground that he would fetter our\nstyle by the laws of rhythm.

But the\nrounding of the period to an appropriate close which\nis produced by the combination of feet requires some\nname; and what name is there more suitable than\nrhythm, that is to say, the rhythm of oratory, just as\nthe  is the syllogism of oratory? For my\nown part, to avoid incurring the calumny, from which\neven Cicero was not free, I ask my reader, whenever I\nspeak of the rhythm of artistic structure (as I have\ndone on every occasion), to understand that I refer\nto the rhythm of oratory, not of verse."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "58"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "59"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "60"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.541"}, "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "e.g."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "vitavisse"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "vitasse"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "deprehendere"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "deprendere."}], "#text": "It is the task of collocation to link together the\nwords which have been selected, approved and handed\nover to its custody.

Rhythm\npervades the whole body of prose through all its\nextent. For we cannot speak without employing the\nlong and short syllables of which feet are composed.\nIts presence is, however, most necessary and most\napparent at the conclusion of the period, firstly\nbecause every group of connected thoughts has its\nnatural limit and demands a reasonable interval to\ndivide it from the commencement of what is to\nfollow: secondly because the ear, after following the\nunbroken flow of the voice and being carried along\ndown the stream of oratory, finds its best opportunity\nof forming a sound judgement on what it has heard,\nwhen the rush of words comes to a halt and gives it\n\n\n\ntime for consideration. Consequently all harshness\nand abruptness must be avoided at this point, where\nthe mind takes breath and recovers its energy. It\nis there that style has its citadel, it is this point that\nexcites the eager expectation of the audience, it is\nfrom this that the declaimer wins all his glory.\nNext to the conclusion of the period, it is the\nbeginning which claims the most care: for the\naudience have their attention fixed on this as well.\nBut the opening of the sentence presents less difficulty, since it is independent and is not the slave of\nwhat has preceded. It merely takes what has preceded as a starting point, whereas the conclusion\ncoheres with what has preceded, and however carefully constructed, its elegance will be wasted, if the\npath which leads up to it be interrupted. Hence it\nis that although the rhythmical structure adopted by\nDemosthenes in the passage  and again in another passage (approved by\nall, I think, except Brutus)  is regarded as severely correct, Cicero is\ncriticised for passages such as  and for the not less unpleasing \nFor although  and  give exactly\nthe same cadence as  and \nthe former are more severely correct. There is also\nsomething in the fact that in the passages from\nCicero two feet are contained in one word, a\npractice which even in verse produces an unduly\neffeminate effect, and that not merely when the line\nends with a five-syllable word as in \n but also in four-syllable endings such\n\n\n\nas    Consequently\nwe must also avoid ending our periods with words\ncontaining too many syllables.\nWith regard to the middle portions of our periods\nwe must take care not merely that they possess\ninternal cohesion, but also that the rhythm is neither\nsluggish nor long, and above all that we do not fall\ninto the now fashionable fault of placing a number\nof short syllables together with the result that we\nproduce an effect not unlike the sound of a child's\nrattle. For while the beginnings and conclusions of\nperiods, where the sense begins or ends, are the most\nimportant, it is none the less the fact that the middle\nportion may involve some special efforts which\nnecessitate slight pauses. Remember that the feet\nof a runner, even though they do not linger where\nthey fall, still leave a footprint. Consequently not\nonly must  and  begin and end becomingly, but even in parts which are absolutely\ncontinuous without a breathing space, there must be\nsuch almost imperceptible pauses. Who, for example,\ncan doubt that there is but one thought in the following passage and that it should be pronounced without\na halt for breath?  Still the\ngroups formed by the first two words, the next three,\nand then again by the next two and three, have each\ntheir own special rhythms and cause a slight check\nin our breathing: at least such is the opinion of\nspecialists in rhythm. And just in proportion as\nthese small segments of the period are grave or\nvigorous, slow or rapid, languid or the reverse, so\nwill the periods which they go to form be severe or\nluxuriant, compact or loose.

Both types\nare useful in their proper place: for weight and\nslowness are rightly condemned in passages where\nspeed is required, as are jerkiness and excessive\nspeed in passages which call for weight.

Ephorus may express a preference for the\n (which was discovered by Thrasymachus and\napproved by Aristotle) and for the  also, on\nthe ground that both these feet provide a happy\nmixture of long and short; and may avoid the\n and the  condemning the one as too\nslow and the other as too rapid; Aristotle may\nregard the  foot, which is another name for\nthe  as too dignified and the  as too\ncommonplace, and may damn the  too\n\n\n\nhasty and dub it the  Theodectes and Theophrastus may agree with him, and a later critic,\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, may adopt a similar\nview; but for all they say, these feet will force\nthemselves upon them against their will, and it will\nnot always be possible for them to employ the \nor their beloved  which they select for special\npraise because it so rarely forms part of a verse rhythm. It is not, however, the words which cause\nsome feet to be of more common occurrence than\nothers; for the words cannot be increased or\ndiminished in bulk, nor yet can they, like the notes\nin music, be made short or long at will; everything\ndepends on transposition and arrangement. For a\nlarge proportion of feet are formed by the connexion\nor separation of words, which is the reason why\nseveral different verses can be made out of the same\nwords: for example, I remember that a poet of no\nsmall distinction writing the following line:\n\n\n\na line which, if the order of the words be reversed,\nbecomes a Sotadean; again, the following Sotadean,\nif reversed, reads as as an \n\n\n\nFeet therefore should be mixed, while care must be\ntaken that the majority are of a pleasing character,\nand that the inferior feet are lost in the surrounding\ncrowd of their superior kindred. The nature of\nletters and syllables cannot be changed, but their\nadaptability to each other is a consideration of no\nsmall importance. Long syllables, as I have said,\n\n\n\ncarry the greater dignity and weight, while short\nsyllables create an impression of speed: if the latter\nare intermixed with a few long syllables, their gait\nwill be a run, but a gallop if they are continuous.\nWhen a short syllable is followed by a long the effect\nis one of vigorous ascent, while a long followed by a\nshort produces a gentler impression and suggests\ndescent. It is therefore best to begin with long\nsyllables, though at times it may be correct to begin\nwith short, as in the phrase  a gentler\neffect is created, if we commence with two shorts,\nas in the phrase  but this opening, which comes from the  is perfectly\ncorrect, since that speech begins with something\nsimilar to partition, which requires speed. Similarly\nthe conclusion of a sentence is stronger when long\nsyllables preponderate, but it may also be formed\nof short syllables, although the quantity of the final\nsyllable is regarded as indifferent. I am aware that\na concluding short syllable is usually regarded as\nequivalent to a long, because the time-length which\nit lacks appears to be supplied from that which\nfollows. But when I consult my own ears I find\nthat it makes a great difference whether the final\nsyllable is really long or only treated as the equivalent of a long. For there is not the same fullness\nof rhythm in  as there is in\n But if it makes no difference\nwhether the final syllable be long or short, the concluding feet in these two instances must be identical:\nand yet somehow or other one gives the impression\nof sitting down and the other of a simple halt.\nThis fact has led some critics to allow three timebeats for a final long syllable, adding the extra\n\n\n\ntime-length which a short syllable derives from its\nposition at the end of a sentence to the long syllable\nas well. And it not merely makes a difference with\nwhat foot a sentence ends, but the penultimate\nfoot is also of importance. It is not, however,\nnecessary to go back further than three feet, and\nonly that if the feet contain less than three syllables,\nfor we must avoid the exactitude of verse: on the\nother hand, we must not go back less than two:\notherwise we shall be dealing with a foot and not\nwith rhythm. But in this connexion the \nmay be regarded as one foot, if indeed a foot consisting of two  can be considered as a single foot.\nThe same is true of the  composed of the\n and a  a foot which is regarded as\nspecially suitable to the beginning of a sentence, or\nof the other  formed of three shorts followed\nby a long, to which the conclusion is specially\ndedicated. It is of these two forms that writers on\nrhythm generally speak. Some, however, call all\nfeet containing three short syllables and a long by\nthe name of  irrespective of the position of\nthe long syllable, and merely taking into account the\ntotal number of time-lengths that it contains.

The\n is employed at the conclusion, sometimes in\nconjunction with itself as in  while it\nis also effective when a  and  are placed\nbefore it as in  Its opposite, the\n is also employed as a conclusion (unless, of course, we insist that the last syllable of a\nsentence is always long), and is best preceded by a\n as in  sum, or by a  as\nin  It would, however,\nbe truer to say that in such cases the conclusion consists of a  preceded by a  for the rhythm\nis concentrated in  and  The\n which is the repetition of one and the same\nfoot, may also form the conclusion, and was much\nbeloved by the Asiatic school: Cicero illustrates it by\n The\n may also be preceded by a  as in  The\n also may come at the close, unless indeed it be\nheld that, when it forms the final foot, it is transformed\ninto a  e.g.  The\neffect will be good if it is preceded by a  or an\n but unsatisfactory if it is preceded by a\n\n\n\n and worse still if by a  may close the cadence, as in Q.  although in that case some will prefer\nto call it a  The  is one of the less\ngood endings, if any final syllable is to be regarded\nas short, as it undoubtedly must be.

Of course, if it be insisted that the final\nsyllable is long, the  becomes an  If\npreceded by a long syllable, the  becomes a\n as is the case with phrases such as  or\n or  But this form of\n is specially allotted to the beginnings of\nsentences.

Wherever it is essential to speak with\nforce, energy and pugnacity, we shall make free use\nof  and  since this is most effective, and\nour rhythmical structure must be so closely conformed to our matter, that violent themes should be\nexpressed in violent rhythms to enable the audience\nto share the horror felt by the speaker. On the\nother hand we shall employ  by preference when\nnarrating facts, or relax the texture of our periods\nby considerable pauses and looser connexions, always\nexcepting those passages in which narration is\ndesigned for decorative effect and not merely for\nthe instruction of the audience, as for example the\npassage in the Verrines where Cicero tells the story\nof the Rape of Proserpine: for in such cases a smooth\nand flowing texture is required.

No one will deny\nthat some portions of our speech require a gentle\nflow of language, while others demand speed,\nsublimity, pugnacity, ornateness or simplicity, as\nthe case may be, or that long syllables are best\nadapted to express dignity, sublimity and ornateness.\nThat is to say, while the gentler form of utterance\nrequires length of vowel sounds, sublime and ornate\nlanguage demands sonority as well. On the other\nhand, passages of an opposite character, such as those\nin which we argue, distinguish, jest or use language\napproximating to colloquial speech, are better served\nby short syllables. Consequently in the \nwe shall vary our structure to suit the thought.\nFor I cannot agree with Celsus, when he would\nimpose a single stereotyped form upon the \nand asserts that the best example of the structure\nrequired for this purpose is to be found in Asinius:\ne.

Did\nCicero employ similar rhythms in his  to the\n the  and the \nThe  as a rule requires slower and\nwhat I may be allowed to call more modest feet;\nand the different kinds of feet should, as far as\npossible, be intermixed. For while the style of this\nportion of our speech is generally marked by restraint\nof language, there are occasions when it is called\nupon to soar to greater heights, although on the\nother hand its aim will at all times be to instruct the\naudience and impress the facts upon their minds, a\ntask which must not be carried out in a hurry.

For we\nshall really be indulging in a species of versification\nif we seek to lay down one law for all varieties of\nspeech: further, to do so would lay us open to the\ncharge of the most obvious affectation, a fault of\nwhich we should avoid even the smallest suspicion,\nwhile we should also weary and cloy our audience by\nthe resulting monotony; the sweeter the rhythm,\nthe sooner the orator who is detected in a studied\nadherence to its employment, will cease to carry\nconviction or to stir the passions and emotions. The\njudge will refuse to believe him or to allow him to\nexcite his compassion or his anger, if he thinks that\nhe has leisure for this species of refinement. It will\ntherefore be desirable from time to time that in\ncertain passages the rhythm should be deliberately\ndissolved: this is a task of no small difficulty, if the\nappearance of effort is to be avoided. In so doing\nwe must not come to the assistance of the rhythm\nby introducing  of extravagant length, for\nfear that we should betray the purpose of our action:\nand we should certainly never in our search for\nsmoothness abandon for another any word that is\napt and appropriate to our theme. As a matter of\nfact no word will be so intractable as to baffle all our\nattempts to find it a suitable position; but it must\nbe remembered that when we avoid such words, we\ndo so not to enhance the charm of our rhythm, but\nto evade a difficulty. I am not, however, surprised\nthat Latin writers have paid more attention to\nrhythmical structure than the Athenians, since Latin\nwords possess less correctness and charm. Nor again\ndo I account it a fault in Cicero that, in this respect,\nhe diverged to some extent from the practice of\n\n\n\nDemosthenes. However, my final book will explain\nthe nature of the difference between our language\nand that of Greece."}, {"milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "147"}, "#text": "But I must bring this book to a conclusion without\nmore delay, since it has already exceeded the limits\ndesigned for it.
