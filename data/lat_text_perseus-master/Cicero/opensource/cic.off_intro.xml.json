In 161 B.C.\nthe senate passed a decree excluding all philosophers\n\n\n\nand teachers of rhetoric from the city. They had no\ntaste for philosophical speculation, in which the Greeks\nwere the world's masters. They were intensely,\nnarrowly practical. And Cicero was thoroughly\nRoman. As a student in a Greek university he\nhad had to study philosophy. His mind was broad\nenough and his soul great enough to give him a joy\nin following after the mighty masters, Socrates, Plato,\nZeno, Cleanthes, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and the\nrest. But he pursued his study of it, like a Roman,\nfrom a  motiveto promote thereby his\npower as an orator and to augment his success and\nhappiness in life. To him the goal of philosophy was\nnot primarily to know but to do. Its end was to point\nout the course of conduct that would lead to success\nand happiness. The only side of philosophy, therefore, that could make much appeal to the Roman\nmind was ethics; pure science could have little\nmeaning for the practical Roman; metaphysics might\nsupplement ethics and religion, without which true\nhappiness was felt to be impossible."}, "Philosophical study had its place, therefore, and\nthe most important department of philosophy was\nethics. The treatise on Moral Duties has the very\npractical purpose of giving a practical discussion of\nthe basic principles of Moral Duty and practical\nrules for personal conduct.", "As a philosopher, if we may so stretch the term as\nto include him, Cicero avows himself an adherent of\nthe New Academy and a disciple of Carneades.

But there is the easily obtainable golden mean of the probable; and that appealed\nto the practical Roman. It appealed especially to\nCicero; and the same indecision that had been his\nbane in political life naturally led him first to scepticism, then to eclecticism, where his choice is\ndictated by his bias for the practical and his scepticism itself disappears from view. And while Antiochus,\nthe eclectic Academician of Athens, and Posidonius,\nthe eclectic Stoic of Rhodes, seem to have had the\nstrongest influence upon him, he draws at his own\ndiscretion from the founts of Stoics, Peripatetics, and\nAcademicians alike; he has only contempt for the\nEpicureans, Cynics, and Cyrenaics. But the more he\nstudied and lived, the more of a Stoic in ethics he\nbecame."}, "The cap-sheaf of Cicero's ethical studies is the\ntreatise on the Moral Duties. It takes the form of a\nletter addressed to his son Marcus (see Index), at this\ntime a youth of twenty-one, pursuing his university\nstudies in the Peripatetic school of Cratippus in\nAthens, and sowing for what promised to be an\nabundant crop of wild oats. This situation gives\nforce and definiteness to the practical tendencies of\nthe father's ethical teachings. And yet, be it observed, that same father is not without censure for\ncontributing to his son's extravagant and riotous\nliving by giving him an allowance of nearly 870 a\nyear.", {"foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "Peri\\ Kaqh/kontos,"}, "pb": {"@id": "p.xiv"}, "quote": ["Pagan Christian.", "You would fancy sometimes,", "it\nis not a Pagan philosopher but a Christian apostle\nwho is speaking.", "the best\nwork on morals that has been or can be written."], "#text": "Our Roman makes no pretensions to originality\nin philosophic thinking.

He is usually superficial and not always clear. He translates and\nparaphrases Greek philosophy, weaving in illustrations from Roman history and suggestions of Roman\nmould in a form intended to make it, if not popular,\nat least comprehensible, to the Roman mind.
