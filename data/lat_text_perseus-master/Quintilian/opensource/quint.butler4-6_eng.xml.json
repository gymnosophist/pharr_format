For although he may be\nmodest and say little about himself, yet if he is\nbelieved to be a good man, this consideration will\nexercise the strongest influence at every point of\nthe case. For thus he will have the good fortune to\ngive the impression not so much that he is a\nzealous advocate as that he is an absolutely reliable\nwitness. It is therefore pre-eminently desirable\nthat he should be believed to have undertaken\nthe case out of a sense of duty to a friend or\nrelative, or even better, if the point can be made,\nby a sense of patriotism or at any rate some serious\nmoral consideration.

For\nmen have a natural prejudice in favour of those\nwho are struggling against difficulties, and a scrupulous judge is always specially ready to listen to an\nadvocate whom he does not suspect to have designs\non his integrity. Hence arose the tendency of\nancient orators to pretend to conceal their eloquence,\na practice exceedingly unlike the ostentation of our\nown times. It is also important to avoid giving the\nimpression that we are abusive, malignant, proud\nor slanderous toward any individual or body of\nmen, especially such as cannot be hurt without\nexciting the disapproval of the judges.

Our opponent's advocate will sometimes provide us with\nmaterial for our  we may speak of him\nin honorific terms, pretending to fear his eloquence\nand influence with a view to rendering them suspect\nto the judge, or occasionally, though very seldom, we\nmay abuse him, as Asinius did in his speech on behalf\nof the heirs of Urbinia, where he includes among the\nproofs of the weakness of the plaintiff's case the fact\nthat he has secured Labienus as his advocate.\n\n\n\nCornelius Celsus denies that such remarks can be\nconsidered as belonging to the  on the\nground that they are irrelevant to the actual case.\nPersonally I prefer to follow the authority of the\ngreatest orators, and hold that whatever concerns the\npleader is relevant to the case, since it is natural that\nthe judges should give readier credence to those to\nwhom they find it a pleasure to listen. The character\nof our client himself may, too, be treated in various\nways: we may emphasise his worth or we may\ncommend his weakness to the protection of the\ncourt. Sometimes it is desirable to set forth his\nmerits, when the speaker will be less hampered by\nmodesty than if he were praising his own. Sex, age\nand situation are also important considerations, as for\ninstance when women, old men or wards are pleading\nin the character of wives, parents or children.\nFor pity alone may move even a strict judge.\nThese points, however, should only be lightly touched\nupon in the  not run to death. As regards\nour opponent he is generally attacked on similar\nlines, but with the method reversed.

Such\ncases demand the attention of both parties and I am\nnot sure that the party favoured by the judge does\nnot require to handle the situation with even more\ncare than his opponent. For perverse judges have\nsometimes a preposterous tendency to give judgment against their friends or in favour of those with\nwhom they have a quarrel, and of committing injustice merely to avoid the appearance of partiality.\nAgain some have been judges in cases where their\nown interests were involved.

The commonest and most popular is to\nthreaten them with the displeasure of the Roman\npeople or the transference of the juries to another\nclass; the second is somewhat brutal and is rarely\nemployed, and consists in threatening them with a\nprosecution for bribery: this is a method which is\nfairly safe with a large body of judges, since it\nchecks the bad and pleases the good members of\nthe jury, but I should never recommend its employment with a single judge except in the very last\nresort. But if necessity should drive us to such a\ncourse, we must remember that such threats do not\ncome under the art of oratory, any more than appeals\nfrom the judgment of the court (though that is often\nuseful), or the indictment of the judge before he\ngives his decision.

But as this is impossible in scandalous\ncases, they would have the orator on such occasions insinuate himself little by little into the minds of his\njudges, especially when the features of the case which\nmeet the eye are discreditable, or because the subject\nis disgraceful or such as to meet with popular disapproval, or again if the outward circumstances of the\ncase are such as to handicap it or excite odium (as for\ninstance when a patron appears against a client or a\nfather against a son), or pity (as when our opponent\nis an old or blind man or a child). To save the situation the rhetoricians lay down a number of rules at\nquite inordinate length: they invent fictitious cases\nand treat them realistically on the lines which would\nbe followed in actual pleading. But these peculiar\ncircumstances arise from such a variety of causes as\nto render classification by species impossible, and\ntheir enumeration save under the most general heads\nwould be interminable. The line to be adopted will\ntherefore depend on the individual nature of each\ncase. As a general principle, however, I should\nadvise the avoidance of points which tell against us\nand concentrate on those which are likely to be of\nservice. If the case itself is weak, we may derive\nhelp from the character of our client; if his character\nis doubtful, we may find salvation in the nature of\n\n\n\nthe case. If both are hopeless, we must look out for\nsomething that will damage our opponent. For\nthough it is desirable to secure as much positive\ngood-will as possible, the next best thing is to incur\nthe minimum of actual dislike. Where we cannot\ndeny the truth of facts that are urged against us, we\nmust try to show that their significance has been\nexaggerated or that the purpose of the act was not\nwhat is alleged or that the facts are irrelevant or\nthat what was done may be atoned for by penitence\nor has already been sufficiently punished. It is\nconsequently easier for an advocate to put forward\nsuch pleas than for his client, since the former can\npraise without laying himself open to the charge of\narrogance and may sometimes even reprove him with\nadvantage to the case. At times, like Cicero in his\ndefence of Rabirius Postumus, he will pretend that\nhe himself is strongly moved, in order to win the\near of the judge and to give the impression of\none who is absolutely convinced of the truth of his\ncause, that so his statements may find all the readier\ncredence whether he defends or denies the actions\nattributed to his client. Consequently it is of the first\nimportance, wherever the alternative is open to us,\nto consider whether we are to adopt the character of\na party to the suit or of an advocate. In the schools,\nof course, we have a free choice in the matter, but it\nis only on rare occasions that a man is capable of\npleading his own case in the actual courts. When\nwe are going to deliver a declamation on a theme\nthat turns largely on its emotional features, we\nmust give it a dramatic character suited to the\npersons concerned. For emotions are not transferable at will, nor can we give the same forcible\n\n\n\nexpression to another man's emotions that we should\ngive to our own. The circumstances which call for\ninsinuation arise also in cases where the pleading of\nour opponent has made a powerful impression on the\nminds of the judges, or where the audience whom\nwe have to address are tired. The first difficulty we\nshall evade by promising to produce our own proofs\nand by eluding the arguments of our opponents, the\nsecond by holding out hopes that we shall be brief\nand by the methods already mentioned for capturing\nthe attention of the judges. Again an opportune\ndisplay of wit will often restore their flagging spirits\nand we may alleviate their boredom by the introduction of entertaining matter derived from any source\nthat may be available. It will also be found advantageous to anticipate the objections that may be\nraised by our opponent, as Cicero does when he\nsays  he then goes on to show\nthat the accusation which he has undertaken is\nreally a defence of the allies, an artifice known as\n or anticipation.

As a result, even although the rest of the\nspeech has been committed to writing and carefully\nelaborated, the whole of the speech will often be\nregarded as extempore, simply because its commencement is clearly not the result of previous\nstudy.

His speech\nwould have been much less effective, if any other\nfigure had been used, as will be all the more clearly\nrealised, if the whole of that most vigorous passage\n\nbe altered so as to be addressed to the judge. For\nit is a real and most unnatural diversion of the\npassage, which destroys its whole force, if we say\n In the\noriginal form Cicero attacks his opponent and\npresses him hard, in the passage as altered he\nwould merely have pointed out a fact. The same\nthing results if you alter the turn of the passage in\nDemosthenes. Again did not Sallust when\nspeaking against Cicero himself address his \nto him and not to the judge?

The best kind of preparatory remarks are\nthose which cannot be recognised as such: Cicero,\nfor instance, is extraordinarily happy in the way he\nmentions in advance everything that shows that\nClodius lay in wait for Milo and not Milo for Clodius.\nThe most effective stroke of all is his cunning feint\nof simplicity:  What an absence of haste\nand premeditation this gives to Milo's proceedings.\nAnd the great orator secures this effect not merely\nby producing facts which indicate the slow and\ntardy nature of Milo's departure, but by the use of\nthe ordinary language of everyday speech and a\ncareful concealment of his art. Had he spoken\notherwise, his words would by their very sound have\nwarned the judge to keep an eye on the advocate.\nThe majority of readers regard this passage as lacking in distinction, but this very fact merely serves\n\n\n\nto show how the art which is scarce detected by a\nreader succeeded in hoodwinking the judge.

The accuser has made a  and has done so not merely in such a way as\nto indicate what was done, but has added such\ncomments as might excite strong prejudice against\nus and made the facts seem worse than they are\nby the language which he has used.

Yes,\nif the question turns on the nature of the act, as\nit will if there is no doubt about the commission,\nbut we must restate them in a different way,\nalleging other motives and another purpose and\nputting a different complexion on the case. Some\nimputations we may mitigate by the use of other\nwords; luxury will be softened down into generosity,\n\n\n\navarice into economy, carelessness into simplicity,\nand I shall seek to win a certain amount of favour\nor pity by look, voice and attitude.

For if\nthey refuse either to defend or to state the facts,\nthey will be giving away their whole case. If, on\nthe other hand, they do propose to put in a defence,\nthey must at least, as a rule, set forth what they\nintend to justify. Why then not state fully facts\nwhich can be got rid of and must in fact be pointed\nout to make that possible? Or again what\ndifference is there between a  and a  save that the latter is a  put forward\nin continuous form, while a  is a verification\nof the facts as put forward in the  Let\nus consider therefore whether under such circumstances the  should not be somewhat\nlonger and fuller than usual, since we shall require\nto make some preliminary remarks and to introduce\ncertain special arguments (note that I say arguments,\nand not argumentation), while it will add greatly\nto the force of our defence if we assert not once\nnor twice that we shall prove what we say is true\nand that the significance of the facts cannot be\nbrought out by one opening statement, bidding them\nwait, delay forming their opinions and hope for the\nbest. Finally it is important to include in our\nstatement anything that can be given a different\ncomplexion from that put upon it by our opponent.\nOtherwise even an  will be superfluous\nin a case of this kind. For what is its purpose if\n\n\n\nnot to make the judge better disposed for the\ninvestigation of the case? And yet it will be\nagreed that the  is never more useful than\nwhen it is necessary to divert the judge from some\nprejudice that he has formed against us. Conjectural cases, on the other handthat is to say\nquestions of factrequire a statement, which will\nmore often deal with the circumstances from which\na knowledge of the point at issue may be derived\nthan with the actual point which is under trial.\nWhen the accuser states these circumstances in\nsuch a manner as to throw suspicion on the case for\nthe defence, and the accused has consequently to\ndispel that suspicion, the facts must be presented to\nthe judge in quite a different light by the latter. But,\nit may be urged, some arguments are strong when put\nforward in bulk, but far less effective when employed\nseparately. My answer is that this remark does not\naffect the question whether we ought to make a\nstatement of fact, but concerns the question how it\nshould be made. For what is there to prevent us\nfrom amassing and producing a number of arguments\nin the  if that is likely to help our cause?\nOr from subdividing our statement of facts and\nappending the proofs to their respective sections\nand so passing on to what remains to be said?\nNeither do I agree with those who assert that\nthe order of our  should always\nfollow the actual order of events, but have a preference for adopting the order which I consider\nmost suitable. For this purpose we can employ a\nvariety of figures. Sometimes, when we bring up\na point in a place better suited to our purpose,\nwe may pretend that it had escaped our notice;\n\n\n\noccasionally, too, we may inform the judge that we\nshall adhere to the natural order for the remainder\nof our statement, since by so doing we shall make\nour case clearer, while at times after stating a fact,\nwe may append the causes which preceded it. For\nthere is no single law or fixed rule governing the\nmethod of defence. We must consider what is\nmost advantageous in the circumstances and nature\nof the case, and treat the wound as its nature\ndictates, dressing at once or, if the dressing can be\ndelayed, applying a temporary bandage. Again I\ndo not regard it as a crime to repeat a statement of\na fact more than once, as Cicero does in the  It is not merely permissible, but sometimes necessary, as in trials for extortion and all\ncomplicated cases; and only a lunatic will allow a\nsuperstitious observance of rules to lead him counter\nto the interests of his case. The reason for placing\nthe statement of facts before the proof is to prevent\nthe judge from being ignorant of the question at\nissue. Why then, if each individual point has to be\nproved or refuted, should not each individual point be\nstated as well? If my own experience may be\ntrusted, I know that I have followed this practice in\nthe courts, whenever occasion demanded it, and my\nprocedure has been approved both by learned authorities and the judges themselves, while the duty of\nsetting forth the case was generally entrusted to me.\nI am not boasting, for there are many with whom I\nhave been associated as counsel, who can bring me to\nbook if I lie. On the other hand this is no reason\nfor not following the order of events as a general rule.\nIndeed inversion of the order has at times a most\nunhappy effect, as for example if you should mention\n\n\n\nfirst that a woman has brought forth and then that\nshe has conceived, or that a will has been read and\nthen that it has been signed. In such cases, if you\nshould happen to have mentioned the later incident,\nit is better to say nothing about the former, which\nmust quite obviously have come first."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "88"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "89"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "90"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "91"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "92"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "93"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "94"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "95"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "96"}], "note": {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "color"}, "quote": "the particular aspect given\nto a case by the skilful manipulation of the factsthe 'gloss'\nor ' varnish' put on them by the accused or accuser.", "#text": "is a technical term for \nPeterson on Quint. x. i. 116."}, "pb": [{"@id": "p.101"}, {"@id": "p.103"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "gloss,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Glosses"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "glosses"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "statement of fact,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "gloss"}], "#text": "Sometimes, too, we get false statements of facts;\nthese, as far as actual pleading in the courts is concerned, fall into two classes.

But whereas, if the question turns on some\nact of our own, we must make one statement and\nstick to it, if it turns on an act committed by others,\nwe may cast suspicion on a number of different\npoints.

In slighter cases, such as are the\nmajority of private suits, the decoration must be\nrestrained and fit close to the subject, while the\nutmost care must be exercised in choice of words.\nThe words which in our purple passages are swept\nalong by the force of our eloquence and lost in the\nprofusion of our language, must in cases such as\nthese be clear and, as Zeno says,  The rhythm should be unobtrusive, but as\nattractive as possible, while the figures must neither\nbe derived from poetry nor such as are contrary to\ncurrent usage, though warranted by the authority of\nantiquity (for it is important that our language should\nbe entirely normal), but should be designed to relieve\ntedium by their variety and should be frequently\n\n\n\nchanged to relax the strain of attention.

Most of them are in\nthe habit, as soon as they have completed the  of digressing to some pleasant and\nattractive topic with a view to securing the utmost\namount of favour from their audience. This practice\noriginated in the display of the schools of declaration and thence extended to the courts as soon as\ncauses came to be pleaded, not for the benefit of the\nparties concerned, but to enable the advocates to\nflaunt their talents. I imagine that they feared that\nif the slender stream of concise statement, such as is\ngenerally required, were followed by the pugnacious\ntone inevitable in the arguing of the case, the speech\nwould fall flat owing to the postponement of the\npleasures of a more expansive eloquence. The objection to this practice lies in the fact that they do\nthis without the slightest consideration of the\ndifference between case and case or reflecting\nwhether what they are doing will in any way assist\nthem, on the assumption that it is always expedient\nand always necessary. Consequently they transfer\nstriking thoughts from the places which they should\nhave occupied elsewhere and concentrate them in\nthis portion of the speech, a practice which involves\neither the repetition of a number of things that they\nhave already said or their omission from the place\nwhich was really theirs owing to the fact that they\nhave already been said. I admit however that this\nform of digression can be advantageously appended,\nnot merely to the  but to each of\nthe different questions or to the questions as a whole,\n\n\n\nso long as the case demand, or at any rate permit it.\nIndeed such a practice confers great distinction and\nadornment on a speech, but only if the digression\nfits in well with the rest of the speech and follows\nnaturally on what has preceded, not if it is thrust in\nlike a wedge parting what should naturally come\ntogether.

This, however, should only be done if\nthere is no question about the facts. Otherwise it is more important to verify your charge than\nto heighten it, since the horrible nature of a charge\nis in favour of the accused, until the charge is\nproved. For it is just the most flagrant crimes that\nare the most difficult to prove. Again a digression\nmay be advantageous if after setting forth the services\nrendered by your client to his opponent you denounce\nthe latter for his ingratitude, or after producing a\nvariety of charges in your statement, you point out\nthe serious danger in which the advancement of such\ncharges is likely to involve you. But all these digressions should be brief. For as soon as he has\nheard the facts set forth in order, the judge is in a\nhurry to get to the proof and desires to satisfy himself of the correctness of his impressions at the\nearliest possible moment.

If you were to make a  such\nas the following,  in that case all the proofs\nwhich you propose to bring before this, the final\nproof, must needs seem superfluous to the judge.\nFor the judge is always in a hurry to reach the most\nimportant point. If he has a patient disposition he\nwill merely make a silent appeal to the advocate,\n\n\n\nwhom he will treat as bound by his promise. On\nthe other hand, if he is busy, or holds exalted\nposition, or is intolerant by nature, he will insist in\nno very courteous manner on his coming to the point.\nFor these reasons there are some who disapprove of\nthe  adopted by Cicero in the \nwhere he premises that he is going to show, first,\n secondly,\n and\nfinally,  They argue\nthat if the third point can be proved, there is no\nneed to have urged the two preceding.

Such a form of attack may be\nfound in many speeches, sometimes embedded in\n\n\n\nthe speech for the defence and sometimes published\nseparately like the speech against the evidence of\nVatinius. The whole subject, therefore, demands a\nthorough investigation, as the task which we have\nin hand is the complete education of an orator.\nOtherwise the two books written on this subject by\nDomitius Afer would suffice.

For just as\nin a set speech we usually collect detached arguments which in themselves seem innocuous to the\naccused, but taken together prove the case against\nhim, so we must ask the reluctant witness a number\nof questions relative to acts antecedent or subsequent\nto the case, places, dates, persons, etcetera, with a\nview to luring him into some reply which will force\nhim to make the admissions which we desire or to\ncontradict his previous evidence.

Consequently in view of the\nuncertainty involved, there is need for careful inquiry with a view to discovering the character of the\nwitness against the accused and what are his motives\nfor hostility and what its extent: and all such points\nabout the witness should be set forth in advance\nand disposed of, whether we desire to represent the\nevidence against the accused as instigated by hatred,\nenvy, bribery or influence.

The schools, it is true, give\nno instruction either as to theory or practice in this\nsubject, and skill in examination comes rather\nfrom natural talent or practice. If, however, I am\nasked to point out a model for imitation, I can\nrecommend but one, namely that which may be\nfound in the dialogues of the Socratics and more\nespecially of Plato, in which the questions put are\nso shrewd that although individually as a rule the\nanswers are perfectly satisfactory to the other side,\nyet the questioner reaches the conclusion at which\nhe is aiming. Fortune sometimes is so kind that a\nwitness gives an answer involving some inconsistency,\nwhile at times (and this is a more frequent occurrence)\none witness contradicts another. But acute examination methodically conducted will generally reach\nthe same result which is so often reached by chance.\nThere are also a number of points strictly irrelevant\nto the case on which questions may be put with\nadvantage. We may for example ask questions about\nthe past life of other witnesses or about the witness'\nown character, with a view to discovering whether\nthey can be charged with some disgraceful conduct,\nor degrading occupation, with friendship with the\nprosecutor or hostility toward the accused, since\nin replying to such questions they may say something which will help our cause or may be convicted\n\n\n\nof falsehood or of a desire to injure the accused.\nBut above all our examination must be circumspect,\nsince a witness will often launch some smart repartee\nin answering counsel for the defence and thereby\nwin marked favour from the audience in general.\nSecondly, we must put our questions as far as possible\nin the language of everyday speech that the witness,\nwho is often an uneducated man, may understand our\nmeaning, or at any rate may have no opportunity of\nsaying that he does not know what we mean, a\nstatement which is apt to prove highly disconcerting\nto the examiner. I must however express the\nstrongest disapproval of the practice of sending a\nsuborned witness to sit on the benches of the opposing party, in order that on being called into the\nwitness-box from that quarter he may thereby do all\nthe more damage to the case for the accused by\nspeaking against the party with whose adherents he\nwas sitting or, while appearing to help him by his\ntestimony, deliberately giving his evidence in such\nan extravagant and exaggerated manner, as not only\nto detract from the credibility of his own statements, but to annul the advantage derived from\nthe evidence of those who were really helpful.

For where an indication is irrefutable, there can be no dispute as to facts. This\nhappens whenever there can be no doubt that something is being or has been done, or when it is impossible for it to be or have been done. In such cases\nthere can be no dispute as to the fact. This kind of\nproof may be considered in connexion with past,\npresent or future time. For example, a woman who is\ndelivered of a child must have had intercourse with\na man, and the reference is to the past.

So too a woman, who has not been delivered\nof a child, may have had intercourse with a man,\nthere may be waves without a high wind, and a man\nmay die without having received a wound in the\nheart.

For\nthe  (which we translate by  or\n there being no alternative, though we\nshould be wiser to use the Greek name) has three\nmeanings: firstly it means anything conceived in\nthe mind (this is not however the sense of which\nI am now speaking); secondly it signifies a proposition with a reason, and thirdly a conclusion of an\nargument drawn either from denial of consequents or\nfrom incompatibles; although there is some controversy on this point. For there are some who style a\nconclusion from consequents an  while it\nwill be found that the majority hold the view that an\n is a conclusion from incompatibles:\nwherefore Cornificius styles it a  or argument from contraries. Some again call it a rhetorical\nsyllogism, others an incomplete syllogism, because\nits parts are not so clearly defined or of the same\nnumber as those of the regular syllogism, since such\n\n\n\nprecision is not specially required by the orator.\nValgius translates  by  that is\nan attempt. It would however, in my opinion, be\ntruer to say that it is not our handling of the\nsubject, but the thing itself which we attempt which\nshould be called an  that is to say the\nargument by which we try to prove something and\nwhich, even if it has not yet been stated in so many\nwords, has been clearly conceived by the mind.\nOthers regard it not as an attempted or imperfect\nproof, but a complete proof, falling under the most\nspecial species of proof; consequently, according to\nits proper and most generally received appellation it\nmust be understood in the sense of a definite conception of some thought consisting of at least three\nparts. Some call an  a  but Cicero\nis more correct in calling it a  although he\ntoo seems to derive this name from the syllogism\nrather than anything else; for he calls the\n a  and quotes philosophers to support him. And since there is a certain kinship between a syllogism and an \nit may be thought that he was justified in his use of\nthe latter term. An  is a clear proof; hence\nthe use of the term   by the geometricians. Caecilius\nholds that it differs from the  solely in the\nkind of conclusion arrived at and that an  is\nsimply an incomplete  for the same reason\nthat we said an enthymeme differed from a syllogism.\nFor an  is also part of a syllogism. Some\nthink that an  is portion of an \n\n\n\nnamely the part containing the proof. But all\nauthorities, however much they may differ on other\npoints, define both in the same way, in so far as they\ncall both a method of proving what is not certain by\nmeans of what is certain. Indeed this is the nature\nof all arguments, for what is certain cannot be\nproved by what is uncertain. To all these forms of\nargument the Greeks give the name of , a\nterm which, though the literal translation is   is best translated by \n But  has several other meanings.\nFor the plots of plays composed for acting in the\ntheatre are called arguments, while Pedianus, when\nexplaining the themes of the speeches of Cicero,\nsays  Cicero himself in\nwriting to Brutus says,  It is thus clear that all\nsubjects for writing are so called. Nor is this to be\nwondered at, since the term is also in common use\namong artists; hence the Vergilian phrase  Again a work which deals with a number\nof different themes is called \nBut the sense with which we are now concerned is\nthat which provides proof Celsus indeed treats\nthe terms, proof, indication, credibility, attempt,\nsimply as different names for the same things, in\nwhich, to my thinking, he betrays a certain confusion of thought. For proof and credibility are not\nmerely the result of logical processes, but may\nequally be secured by inartificial arguments. Now\nI have already distinguished signs or, as he prefers\nto call them, indications from arguments. Consequently, since an argument is a process of reasoning\n\n\n\nwhich provides proof and enables one thing to be\ninferred from another and confirms facts which are\nuncertain by reference to facts which are certain,\nthere must needs be something in every case which\nrequires no proof. Otherwise there will be nothing\nby which we can prove anything; there must be\nsomething which either is or is believed to be true,\nby means of which doubtful things may be rendered\ncredible. We may regard as certainties, first, those\nthings which we perceive by the senses, things for\ninstance that we hear or see, such as signs or indications; secondly, those things about which there is\ngeneral agreement, such as the existence of the gods\nor the duty of loving one's parents; thirdly, those\nthings which are established by law or have passed\ninto current usage, if not throughout the whole\nworld, at any rate in the nation or state where the\ncase is being pleadedthere are for instance many\nrights which rest not on law, but on custom; finally,\nthere are the things which are admitted by either\nparty, and whatever has already been proved or is\nnot disputed by our adversary. Thus for instance it\nmay be argued that since the world is governed by\nprovidence, the state should similarly be governed\nby some controlling power: it follows that the state\nmust be so governed, once it is clear that the world\nis governed by providence. Further, the man who is\nto handle arguments correctly must know the nature\nand meaning of everything and their usual effects.\nFor it is thus that we arrive at probable arguments\nor  as the Greeks call them. With regard to\ncredibility there are three degrees. First, the\nhighest, based on what usually happens, as for instance the assumption that children are loved by\n\n\n\ntheir parents. Secondly, there is the highly\nprobable, as for instance the assumption that a man\nin the enjoyment of good health will probably live\ntill to-morrow. The third degree is found where\nthere is nothing absolutely against an assumption,\nsuch as that a theft committed in a house was the\nwork of one of the household. Consequently\nAristotle in the second book of his  has\nmade a careful examination of all that commonly\nhappens to things and persons, and what things and\npersons are naturally adverse or friendly to other\nthings or persons, as for instance, what is the\nnatural result of wealth or ambition or superstition,\nwhat meets with the approval of good men, what is\nthe object of a soldier's or a farmer's desires, and by\nwhat means everything is sought or shunned. For\nmy part I do not propose to pursue this subject. It\nis not merely a long, but an impossible or rather an\ninfinite task; moreover it is within the compass of\nthe common understanding of mankind. If, however, anyone wishes to pursue the subject, I have\nindicated where he may apply. But all credibility,\nand it is with credibility that the great majority of\narguments are concerned, turns on questions such\nas the following: whether it is credible that a father\nhas been killed by his son, or that a father has committed incest with his daughter, or to take questions\nof an opposite character, whether it is credible that\na stepmother has poisoned her stepchild, or that a\nman of luxurious life has committed adultery; or\nagain whether a crime has been openly committed,\nor false evidence given for a small bribe, since each\nof these crimes is the result of a special cast of\ncharacter as a rule, though not always; if it were\n\n\n\nalways so, there would be no room for doubt, and\nno argument."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}], "quote": ["places", "place,"], "note": ["In previous chapter.", "See ii. iv. 22, v. xii. 6 and xiii. 57."], "#text": "Let us now turn to consider the  of arguments, although some hold that they are identical\nwith the topics which I have already discussed\nabove.

I have no intention of\ntracing all the accidents of persons, as many have\ndone, but shall confine myself to those from which\narguments may be drawn. Such are birth, for\npersons are generally regarded as having some\nresemblance to their parents and ancestors, a resemblance which sometimes leads to their living\ndisgracefully or honourably, as the case may be;\nthen there is nationality, for races have their own\ncharacter, and the same action is not probable in the\ncase of a barbarian, a Roman and a Greek; country\nis another, for there is a like diversity in the laws,\ninstitutions and opinions of different states; sex,\nsince for example a man is more likely to commit a\nrobbery, a woman to poison; age, since different\nactions suit different ages; education and training,\nsince it makes a great difference who were the instructors and what the method of instruction in each\nindividual case; bodily constitution, for beauty is\noften introduced as an argument for lust, strength as\nan argument for insolence, and their opposites for\nopposite conduct; fortune, since the same acts are\nnot to be expected from rich and poor, or from one\nwho is surrounded by troops of relations, friends or\nclients and one who lacks all these advantages;\ncondition, too, is important, for it makes a great\ndifference whether a man be famous or obscure, a\nmagistrate or a private individual, a father or a son,\na citizen or a foreigner, a free man or a slave,\nmarried or unmarried, a father or childless. Nor\nmust we pass by natural disposition, for avarice,\nanger, pity, cruelty, severity and the like may often\nbe adduced to prove the credibility or the reverse of\na given act; it is for instance often asked whether a\n\n\n\nman's way of living be luxurious, frugal or parsimonious. Then there is occupation, since a rustic, a\nlawyer, a man of business, a soldier, a sailor, a doctor\nall perform very different actions. We must also\nconsider the personal ambitions of individuals, for\ninstance whether they wish to be thought rich or\neloquent, just or powerful. Past life and previous\nutterances are also a subject for investigation, since\nwe are in the habit of inferring the present from the\npast. To these some add passion, by which they\nmean some temporary emotion such as anger or fear;\nthey also add design, which may refer to the past,\npresent or future. These latter, however, although\naccidents of persons, should be referred to that class\nof arguments which we draw from causes, as also\nshould certain dispositions of mind, for example\nwhen we inquire whether one man is the friend or\nenemy of another. Names also are treated as\naccidents of persons; this is perfectly true, but names\nare rarely food for argument, unless indeed they\nhave been given for some special reasons, such as the\ntitles of Wise, Great, Pious, or unless the name has\nsuggested some special thought to the bearer.\nLentulus for instance had the idea of conspiracy\nsuggested to him by the fact that according to the\nSibylline books and the Responses of the soothsayers the tyranny was promised to three members\nof the Cornelian family, and he considered himself to\nbe the third in succession to Sulla and Cinna, since\nhe too bore the name Cornelius. On tile other hand\nthe conceit employed by Euripides where he makes\nEteocles taunt his brother Polynices on the ground\nthat his name is evidence of character, is feeble in\nthe extreme.

For the motive\nfor any action is as a rule concerned with the acquisition, increase, preservation and use of things that are\ngood or with the avoidance, diminution, endurance\nof things that are evil or with escape there from.\nAll these considerations carry great weight in deliberative oratory as well. But right actions have\nright motives, while evil actions are the result of\nfalse opinions, which originate in the things which\nmen believe to be good or evil. Hence spring errors\nand evil passions such as anger, hatred, envy, desire,\nhope, ambition, audacity, fear and others of a similar\nkind. To these accidental circumstances may often\nbe added, such as drunkenness or ignorance, which\nserve sometimes to excuse and sometimes to prove\na charge, as for instance when a man is said to have\nkilled one person while lying in wait for another.\nFurther, motives are often discussed not merely to\nconvict the accused of the offence with which he is\ncharged, but also to defend him when he contends\n\n\n\nthat his action was right, that is to say proceeded\nfrom an honourable motive, a theme of which I have\nspoken more fully in the third book. Questions\nof definition are also at times intimately connected\nwith motives. Is a man a tyrannicide if he kills a\ntyrant by whom he has been detected in the act\nof adultery? Or is lie guilty of sacrilege who tore\ndown arms dedicated in a temple to enable him to\ndrive the enemy from the city? Arguments are also\ndrawn from place. With a view to proving our facts\nwe consider such questions as whether a place is hilly\nor level, near the coast or inland, planted or uncultivated, crowded or deserted, near or far, suitable for\ncarrying out a given design or the reverse. This is a\ntopic which is treated most carefully by Cicero in his\n These points and the like generally\nrefer to questions of fact, but occasionally to\nquestions of law as well. For we may ask whether\na place is public or private, sacred or profane, our\nown or another's, just as where persons are concerned\nwe ask whether a man is a magistrate, a father, a\nforeigner. Hence arise such questions as the following. \n\n\"You have committed an assault, but since the\nobject of your assault was a magistrate, the crime is\nlse-majest. Similarly it may be urged in defence,\n But such points afford matter for\nargument when there is a controversy as to the\nfacts, and matter for enquiry when the dispute\nturns on a point of law. Place also frequently\n\n\n\naffects the quality of an action, for the same action\nis not always lawful or seemly under all circumstances, while it makes considerable difference in\nwhat state the enquiry is taking place, for they differ\nboth in custom and law. Further arguments drawn\nfrom place may serve to secure approval or the\nreverse. Ajax for instance in Ovid says:\n\n\n\nAgain one of the many charges brought against\nMilo was that he killed Clodius on the monument of\nhis ancestors. Such arguments may also carry\nweight in deliberative oratory, as may those drawn\nfrom time, which I shall now proceed to discuss.\nTime may, as I have said elsewhere, be understood\nin two different senses, general and special. The first\nsense is seen in words and phrases such as \n   and whenever we speak\nof past, present or future. The second sense occurs\nwhen we speak either of definite periods of time\nsuch as     or of fortuitous periods such as   \nCertain Latin writers have thought it a sufficient\ndistinction to call the general sense  and the\nspecial  In both senses time is of importance\nin advisory speeches and demonstrative oratory, but\nnot so frequently as in forensic. For questions of law\nturn on time, while it also determines the quality of\nactions and is of great importance in questions of\nfact; for instance, occasionally it provides irrefragable\n\n\n\nproofs, which may be illustrated by a case which I\nhave already cited, when one of the signatories to a\ndocument has died before the day on which it was\nsigned, or when a person is accused of the commission of some crime, although he was only an infant\nat the time or not yet born. Further, all kinds of\narguments may easily be drawn either from facts\nprevious to a certain act, or contemporary or subsequent. As regards antecedent facts the following\nexample will illustrate my meaning;  Motives of actions may also belong to\npast time. Some writers have shown themselves\nover-subtle in their classification of the second class\nof circumstances, making  an\nexample of circumstances  with an act and\n an instance of circumstances\n to an act. As regards subsequent circumstances I may cite accusations such as  The counsel for the defence will\nemploy the same divisions of time to discredit the\ncharge which is brought against him. In these\nconsiderations are included everything in connexion\nwith words and deeds, but in two distinct ways.\nFor some things are done because something else is\nlike to follow, and others because something else\nhas previously been done, as for instance, when the\nhusband of a beautiful woman is accused of having\nacted as a procurer on the ground that he bought\nher after she was found guilty of adultery, or\nwhen a debauched character is accused of parricide on the ground that he said to his father\n For\n\n\n\nin the former case the accused is not a procurer\nbecause he bought the woman, but bought her\nbecause he was a procurer, while in the latter the\naccused is not a parricide because he used these\nwords, but used them because lie intended to kill his\nfather. With regard to accidental circumstances,\nwhich also provide matter for arguments, these\nclearly belong to subsequent time, but are distinguished by a certain special quality, as for instance if\nI should say, ;; ;\nor referring to bad qualities, ;  We must also\nconsider the resources possessed by the parties\nconcerned, more especially when dealing with questions of fact; for it is more credible that a smaller\nnumber of persons were killed by a larger, a weaker\nparty by a stronger, sleepers by men that were wide\nawake, the unsuspecting by the well-prepared, while\nthe converse arguments may be used to prove the\nopposite. Such considerations arise both in deliberative and forensic oratory: in the latter they occur\nin relation to two questions, namely, whether some\ngiven person had the will, and whether lie had the\npower to do the deed; for hope will often create\nthe will to act. Hence the well-known inference in\nCicero:  With resources we may\n\n\n\ncouple instruments, which form part of resources and\nmeans. But sometimes instruments will provide us\nwith indications as well, as for instance if we find\na javelin sticking in a dead body. To these we may\nadd manner, the Greek  in regard to which\nwe ask how a thing was done. Manner is concerned\nsometimes with quality and the letter of the law\n(we may for instance argue that it was unlawful to\nkill an adulterer by poison), sometimes with questions of fact, as for example if I argue that an act\nwas committed with a good intent and therefore\nopenly, or with a bad intent and therefore treacherously, by night, in a lonely place."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "53"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "54"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "55"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "56"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "57"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "58"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "59"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "60"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "61"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "62"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "63"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "64"}], "quote": ["places", "places", "subject to\ndeath"], "note": ["See above  20.", {"quote": {"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "assiduus"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "as"}], "#text": "Some think that  was originally\nthe epithet applied to one who served in the army at his own\nexpense, contributing an"}, "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "i.e."}, "#text": "Paulus (exc.

But as there are certain  of argument which are common to\nall three questions, this triple division is impracticable and we must therefore consider these questions rather in connexion with those  in\nwhich they most naturally arise. Arguments, then,\nmay be drawn from definition, sometimes called\n and sometimes  Definition is of two\nkinds. We may ask whether a particular quality is a\nvirtue or make a definition precede and ask what is\nthe nature of a virtue. Such a definition is either\nstated in general terms, such as  or in detail, such as \n\n\n\nFurther, we may define a word by giving its content\nas in the preceding instances, or by etymology: we\nmay for instance explain  by deriving it from\n and  by deriving it from  from \nand  seem more especially to afford scope for\ndefinition, for we derive arguments from all of these.\n is of little use when we desire to prove a\n but of great value for its elimination. A tree\nis not necessarily a plane tree, but that which is not\na tree is certainly not a plane tree; again, a virtue is\nnot necessarily the virtue of justice, but that which\nis not a virtue is certainly not justice. We must\nproceed from the  to the ultimate  for\nexample, to say that man is an animal will not\nsuffice; for animal merely gives us the  nor\nyet will the addition of the words  be adequate; for although this epithet gives\nus a species, it is common to other animals as well.\nIf, however, we define man as a rational animal, we\nneed nothing further to make our meaning clear.\nOn the other hand  will give us clear proof of\n but is of little service for its elimination.\nFor example, justice is always a virtue, but that\nwhich is not justice may still be a virtue, such as\nfortitude, constancy or self-control.  therefore\ncannot be eliminated by  unless all the \nincluded in the  be eliminated, as for instance\nin the following sentence: \n\n\n\n To these they\nadd  and  serve to\nestablish definitions,  to overthrow them.\nA  is that which happens to one particular\nobject and that alone; speech and laughter for\ninstance are  of man. Or it may be something specially belonging to an object, but not to it\nalone; heating for instance is a  of fire. The\nsame thing may also have a number of \nlight and heat are both  of fire. Consequently, the omission of any  in a definition\nwill impair it, but the introduction of a \nwhatever it may be, will not necessarily establish a\ndefinition. We have, however, often to consider\nwhat is a  of some given object; for example,\nif it should be asserted, on the ground of etymology,\nthat the peculiar  of a tyrannicide is to kill\ntyrants, we should deny it: for an executioner is not\n a tyrannicide, if he executes a tyrant who\nhas been delivered to him for the purpose, nor again\nis he a tyrannicide who kills a tyrant unwittingly or\nagainst his will. What is not a  will be a\n it is, for instance, one thing to be a slave,\nand another to be in a state of servitude; hence the\ndistinction raised in connexion with persons assigned\nto their creditors for debt:  There are also other points of\ndifference which are dealt with elsewhere. Again,\nthe term difference is applied in cases when the\n is divided into  and one  is subdivided. Animal, for instance, is a genus, mortal a\n while terrestrial or biped is a  for\nthey are not actually properties, but serve to show\n\n\n\nthe difference between such animals and quadrupeds\nor creatures of the sea. This distinction, however,\ncomes under the province not so much of argument\nas of exact definition. Cicero separates  and  which latter he calls  from definition\nand includes them under relation. For example,\nif a person to whom another man has left all his\nsilver should claim all his silver money as well, he\nwould base his claim upon  on the other hand\nif when a legacy has been left to a married woman\nholding the position of  it should be\nmaintained that the legacy is not due to a woman\nwho never came into the power of her husband, the\nargument is based on  since there are two\nkinds of marriage.

Those who have attempted to perform\nthis latter task have exposed themselves in equal\ndegree to two disadvantages, saying too much and\nyet failing to cover the whole ground. Consequently\nthe majority of students, finding themselves lost in\nan inextricable maze, have abandoned all individual\neffort, including even that which their own wits\nmight have placed within their power, as though\nthey were fettered by certain rigid laws, and keeping their eyes fixed upon their master have ceased\nto follow the guidance of nature. But as it is not\nin itself sufficient to know that all proofs are drawn\neither from persons or things, because each of these\ngroups is subdivided into a number of different heads\nso he who has learned that arguments must be\ndrawn from antecedent, contemporary or subsequent facts will not be sufficiently instructed in\nthe knowledge of the method of handling arguments\nto understand what arguments are to be drawn from\nthe circumstances of each particular case; especially\nas the majority of proofs are to be found in the\nspecial circumstances of individual cases and have\n\n\n\nno connexion with any other dispute, and therefore\nwhile they are the strongest, are also the least\nobvious, since, whereas we derive what is common\nto all cases from general rules, we have to discover\nfor ourselves whatever is peculiar to the case which\nwe have in hand. This type of argument may\nreasonably be described as drawn from circumstances, there being no other word to express the\nGreek  or from those things which are\npeculiar to any given case. For instance, in the\ncase of the priest who having committed adultery\ndesired to save  life by means of the law\nwhich gave him the power of saving  life, the\nappropriate argument to employ against him would\nrun as follows:  For\nsuch an argument follows from the law forbidding\nthe execution of the adulteress apart from the\nadulterer. Again, take the case falling under the\nlaw which lays down that bankers may pay only\nhalf of what they owe, while permitted to recover\nthe whole of what they are owed. One banker\nrequires payment of the whole sum owed him by\nanother banker. The appropriate argument supplied\nby the subject to the creditor is that there was\nspecial reason for the insertion of the clause\nsanctioning the recovery of the whole of a debt\nby a banker, since there was no need of such a law\nas against others, inasmuch as all have the right to\nrecover the whole of a debt from any save a banker.\nBut while some fresh considerations are bound to\npresent themselves in every kind of subject, this is\nmore especially the case in questions turning on\n\n\n\nthe letter of the law, since not merely individual\nwords, but still more whole phrases are frequently\nambiguous. And these considerations must vary\naccording to the complexity of laws and other\ndocuments, whether they are in agreement or contradictory, since fact throws light on fact and law on\nlaw as in the following argument:  It is laid down by law that he\nwho refuses to defend his father when accused of\ntreason thereby loses his right to inherit. A son\ndenies that he is liable to this penalty unless his\nfather is acquitted. How does he support this contention? There is another law to the effect that a\nman found guilty of treason shall be banished and\nhis advocate with him. Cicero in the \nsays that Publius Popilius and Tiberius Gutta were\nnot condemned for receiving bribes to give a false\nverdict, but for attempting to bribe the jury. What\nis his argument in support of this view? That\ntheir accusers, who were themselves found guilty of\nbribing the jury, were restored in accordance with\nlaw after winning their case. But the consideration\nas to what argument should be put forward requires\nno less care than the consideration of the manner in\nwhich we are to prove that which we have put\nforward. Indeed in this connexion invention, if\nnot the most important, is certainly the first consideration. For, just as weapons are superfluous\nfor one who does not know what his target is, so\ntoo arguments are useless, unless you see in advance\nto what they are to be applied. This is a task for\nwhich no formal rules can be laid down.\n\n\n\nConsequently, though a number of orators, who have\nstudied the same rules, will use similar kinds of\narguments, one will discover a greater number of\narguments to suit his case than another. Let us\ntake as an example a controversial theme involving\nproblems that have little in common with other\ncases.  The\ncase is tried before the Amphictyonic council. It is\nadmitted that the Thebans lent the money and\nwere not repaid. The whole dispute turns on the\nallegation that Alexander had excused the Thessalians from payment of the debt. It is also admitted\nthat the Thessalians had received no money from\nAlexander. The question is therefore whether his\ngift is equivalent to his having given them money.\nWhat use will formal topics of argument be in such\na case, unless I first convince myself that the gift of\nAlexander made no difference, that he had not the\npower to make it, and that he did not make it?\nThe opening of the Thebans' plea presents no\ndifficulty and is likely to win the approval of the\njudges, since they are seeking to recover by right\nwhat was taken from them by force. But out of this\npoint arises a violent controversy as to the right of\nwar, since the Thessalians urge that kingdoms and\npeoples and the frontiers of nations and cities\ndepend upon these rights. To meet this argument\n\n\n\nit is necessary to discover in what respect this case\ndiffers from others which are concerned with property that has fallen into the hands of the victor:\nthe difficulty moreover lies not so much in the\nproof as in the way it should be put forward. We\nmay begin by stating that the rights of war do not\nhold good in any matter which can be brought\nbefore a court of justice, and that what is taken\nby force of arms can only be retained by force of\narms, and consequently, wherever the rights of war\nhold good, there is no room for the functions of\na judge, while on the contrary where the functions\nof the judge come into play, the rights of war cease\nto have any force. The reason why it is necessary\nto discover this principle is to enable us to bring\nthe following argument into play: that prisoners of\nwar are free on returning to their native land just\nbecause the gains of war cannot be retained except\nby the exercise of the same violence by which they\nwere acquired. Another peculiar feature of the case\nis that it is tried before the Amphictyonic council,\nand you will remember that we have to employ\ndifferent methods in pleading a case before the\ncentumviral court and before an arbitrator, though\nthe problems of the cases may be identical. Secondly\nwe may urge that the right to refuse payment could\nnot have been conferred by the victor because he\npossesses only what he holds, but a right, being\nincorporeal, cannot be grasped by the hand. It is\nmore difficult to discover this principle than, once\ndiscovered, to defend it with arguments such as\nthat the position of an heir and a conqueror are\nfundamentally different, since right passes to the\none and property to the other. It is further an\n\n\n\nargument peculiar to the subject matter of the case\nthat the right over a public debt could not have\npassed to the victor, because the repayment of a\nsum of money lent by a whole people is due to them\nall, and as long as any single one of them survives,\nhe is creditor for the whole amount: but the\nThebans were never all of them to a man in Alexander's power. The force of this argument resides\nin the fact that it is not based on any external\nsupport, but holds good in itself. Proceeding to\nthe third line of argument we may note that the\nfirst portion of it is of a more ordinary type, namely\nthat the right to repayment is not based on the\nactual document, a plea which can be supported\nby many arguments. Doubt may also be thrown on\nAlexander's purpose: did he intend to honour them\nor to trick them? Another argument peculiar to\nthe subject (indeed it practically introduces a new\ndiscussion) is that the Thebans may be regarded as\nhaving in virtue of their restoration recovered the\nright even though it be admitted that they had lost\nit. Again Cassander's purpose may be discussed,\nbut, as the case is being pleaded before the Amphictyonic council, we shall find that the most powerful\nplea that can be urged is that of equity."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "119"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "120"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "121"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "122"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "123"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "124"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "125"}], "quote": "places", "note": "See V. x. 20.", "pb": [{"@id": "p.269"}, {"@id": "p.271"}], "#text": "I make these remarks, not because I think that a\nknowledge of the  from which arguments\nmay be derived is useless (had I thought so, I\nshould have passed them by)but to prevent those\nwho have learnt these rules from neglecting\nother considerations and regarding themselves as\nhaving a perfect and absolute knowledge of the\nwhole subject, and to make them realise that,\nunless they acquire a thorough knowledge of the\n\n\n\nremaining points which I am about to discuss, they\nwill be the possessors of what I can only call a dumb\nscience. For the discovery of arguments was not\nthe result of the publication of text-books, but every\nkind of argument was put forward before any rules\nwere laid down, and it was only later that writers\nof rhetoric noted them and collected them for publication. A proof of this is the fact that the examples which they use are old and quoted from the\norators, while they themselves discover nothing new\nor that has not been said before. The creators of\nthe art were therefore the orators, though we owe\na debt of gratitude also to those who have given us\na short cut to knowledge. For thanks to them the\narguments discovered by the genius of earlier orators\nhave not got to be hunted out and noted down in\ndetail.

It is employed by\nCicero in his speech on the Replies of the Soothsayers and in the oration in which he denounced\nCatiline to the people, when he points to the statue\nof Jupiter crowning a column, and again in the\n where lie admits the cause of Caesar to\nbe the better because the gods have decided in his\nfavour. When such arguments are inherent in the\ncase itself they are called supernatural evidence;\nwhen they are adduced from without they are styled\nsupernatural arguments.

We must therefore first consider what it is to\nwhich we have to reply, whether it is part and parcel\nof the actual case or has been introduced from circumstances lying outside the case. For in the former\ncase we must deny or justify the facts or raise the\nquestion of competence: for these are practically\nthe sole methods of defence available in the courts.\nPleas for mercy, which are not in any sense a\nmethod of actual defence, can rarely be used, and\n\n\n\nonly before judges who are not limited to some\nprecise form of verdict. Even those speeches delivered before Gaius Caesar and the triumvirs on\nbehalf of members of the opposite party, although\nthey do employ such pleas for mercy, also make use\nof the ordinary methods of defence. For I think\nyou will agree with me that the following passage\ncontains arguments of a strongly defensive character: \nBut if, when pleading before the emperor or any\nother person who has power either to acquit or condemn, it is incumbent on us to urge that, while our\nclient has committed an offence that deserves the\ndeath penalty, it is still the duty of a merciful judge\nto spare him despite his sins, it must be noted in\nthe first place that we have to deal, not with our\nadversary, but with the judge, and secondly that we\nshall have to employ the deliberative rather than the\nforensic style. For we shall urge the judge to fix\nhis desire rather on the glory that is won by\nclemency than on the pleasure that is given by\nvengeance. On the other hand, when we are\npleading before judges who have to give their\nverdict in accordance with the prescriptions of law,\nit would be absurd to give them advice as to how\nthey should deal with a criminal who admits his\nguilt. Consequently, when it is impossible either to\ndeny the facts or to raise the question of competence, we must attempt to justify the facts as\nbest we can, or else throw up the case. I have\npointed out that there are two ways in which a fact\ncan be denied: it can be denied absolutely, or it\nmay be denied that a fact is of the nature alleged.\n\n\n\nWhen it is impossible to plead justification or to\nraise the question of competence, we must deny the\nfacts, and that not merely when a definition of the\nfacts will serve our case, but even when nothing\nexcept an absolute denial is left for us. If witnesses are produced, there is much that may be said\nto discredit them; if a document is put forward,\nwe may hold forth on the similarity of the handwritings. In any case there can be no worse course\nthan confession of guilt. When denial and justification are both impossible, we must as a last resort\nbase our defence on the legal point of competence.\nStill, there are some cases in which none of these\nthree courses is possible.  In this case\nthere is no ground for dispute. Consequently I regard as the height of folly the advice that is given\nin such cases, that what cannot be defended should\nbe ignored and passed over in silence, at any rate if\nthe point in question is that on which the judge has\nto give his decision. On the other hand, if the\nallegation is irrelevant to the actual case and no\nmore than accessory, I should prefer simply to state\nthat it has nothing to do with the question at issue,\nthat it is not worth our attention, and that it has not\nthe importance given to it by our opponent, though\nin such a case I should be prepared to pardon a\npolicy of ignoring the charge such as I have just\nmentioned.

The accuser of Cornelius offers to\nproduce witnesses to show that he read out the law\nwhen tribune: Cicero makes this argument\n\n\n\nsuperHuous by admitting it. Quintus Caecilius demands\nto be entrusted with the task of accusing Verres on\nthe ground that he had been the latter's quaestor:\nCicero actually makes this argument tell in his own\nfavour. As regards other charges, they may all be\ndealt with by very similar methods. For they may\nbe demolished either by conjecture, when we shall\nconsider whether they are true, by definition, when\nwe shall examine whether they are relevant to the\ncase, by quality, when we shall consider whether\nthey are dishonourable, unfair, scandalous, inhuman,\ncruel, or deserve any other epithet coming under\nthe head of quality. Such questions have to be\nconsidered, not merely in connection with the statement of the charges or the reasons alleged, but with\nreference to the nature of the case in its entirety.\nFor instance, the question of cruelty is considered\nwith regard to the charge of high treason brought\nagainst Rabirius by Labienus; of inhumanity in the\ncase of Tubero who accused Ligarius when he was\nan exile and attempted to prevent Caesar from\npardoning him; of arrogance as in the case of the\ncharge brought against Oppius on the strength of\na letter of Cotta. Similarly, it may be shown that\ncharges are hasty, insidious or vindictive. The\nstrongest argument, however, which can be brought\nagainst a charge is that it involves peril to the\ncommunity or to the judges themselves; we find an\nexample of the former in the  where\nCicero says  An instance of the latter occurs\nin the  where Cicero warns the judges at\nsome length not to permit such an action to be\nbrought against the equestrian order. On the other\nhand there are certain arguments which at times\nmay best be treated with contempt, as being trivial\nor irrelevant.

On the other hand it is a task for a real\nartist to discover inconsistencies, real or apparent,\nin the speech of his opponent, though such inconsistencies are sometimes evident from the bare facts,\nas for instance in the case of Caelius, where Clodia\nasserts on the one hand that she lent Caelius money,\nwhich is an indication of great intimacy, and on the\nother hand that he got poison to murder her, which\n\n\n\nis a sign of violent hatred. Tubero similarly\naccuses Ligarius of having been in Africa, and complains that Ligarius refused to allow him to land\nin Africa. At times, however, some ill-advised\nstatement by our opponent will give us an opportunity of demolishing his arguments. This is\nspecially likely to occur with speakers who have a\npassion for producing impressive thoughts: for the\ntemptation to air their eloquence is such that they\ntake no heed of what they have said already, being\nabsorbed by the topic immediately before them to\nthe detriment of the interests of the case as a\nwhole.

They will also contradict what is obvious, speak ambiguously, lose\nsight of the main issue of the case, or give replies\nwhich have no relation to the charges made.

But there is one point which requires\nspecial attention, since in such cases many speakers\nfall into two very different faults. For some even\nin the courts will pass by such objections when\nraised by their opponents as troublesome and vexatious details, and, contenting themselves with the\narguments which they have brought ready-made\n\n\n\nfrom their study, will speak as if their opponent did\nnot exist. This error is of course far more common\nin the schools, for there objections are not merely\ndisregarded, but the subjects for declamation are\ngenerally framed in such a way that there is nothing\nto be said on the opposite side. On the other hand\nthere are some who surfer from excess of zeal,\nand think it their duty to reply to every word\nand even every trifling reflexion, a task which is\nat once endless and superfluous. For it is not the\ncase. but the pleader, whom they are refuting. Personally I should always prefer that a speaker should\nreveal his eloquence in such a way that, if what he\nsays advances his case, the credit will be given to his\ntalent and not to the nature of his case, while if\nwhat he says damages his case the blame will attach\nto the case and not to his powers. Consequently\nwhen we come across denunciations such as that\ndirected against Rullus for the obscurity of his\nlanguage, or against Piso for his utter incapacity as\na speaker, or against Antony for his lack of taste\nand his complete ignorance both of words and\nthings, we shall give then our sanction as reasonable\nconcessions to passion and just resentment, and as\nuseful in stirring up hatred against those whom it is\ndesired to render unpopular. The method of reply\nto our opponent's counsel should be on different\nlines. Sometimes however we are justified in attacking, not merely their manner of speaking, but\nalso their character, their appearance, their gait or\nbearing. Indeed, in his attack on Quintius, Cicero\ndoes not confine himself to these topics, but even\nattacks his purple-bordered toga that goes trailing\nto his heels: for Quintius had caused Cluentius grave\n\n\n\nembarrassment by his turbulent harangues.

On the other hand there is no objection to\ncomplaining of the conduct of the advocates on\neither side, so long as our complaint follows accepted\npractice and does not overstep the limits imposed by\ngood manners; I refer to complaints such as that\nour opponents have abridged, obscured or postponed\nthe discussion of some point, or with deliberate\ncunning have avoided discussing it at all. A change\nin the tactics of defence is also often selected for\ncensure.

Again, there is another\npractice which is always permissible in the schools,\nbut rarely in the courts. For when we speak first\nas claimants in a real case, how can we raise objections, seeing that our opponent has so far said\nnothing? Still, many fall into this error either\nbecause they have acquired the habit in declamation\nor simply owing to a passion for hearing their own\nvoice, thereby affording fine sport to those who\nreply: for sometimes the latter will remark sarcastically that they never said anything of the kind and\nhave no intention of saying anything so idiotic, and\nsometimes that they are grateful for the admirable\n\n\n\nwarnings so kindly given by their opponent: but\nmost often they will say, and this is the strongest\nline that they can take, that their opponent would\nnever have replied to objections which had never\nbeen raised had he not realised that these objections\nwere justified and been driven to admit it by his\nconsciousness of the fact. We may find an example\nof this in the  of Cicero: \nBut there are some who, not content with raising\nimaginary objections, develop whole passages on such\nthemes, saying that they know their opponents will\nsay this and will proceed to argue thus and thus. I\nremember that Vibius Crispus in our own day disposed of this practice very neatly, for he was a\nhumorous fellow with a very pretty wit:  he\nsaid, \nSometimes however it may be possible to put forward something not unlike such objections, if some\npoint included by our opponent in the depositions\nwhich he produces has been discussed among his advocates: for then we shall be replying to something\nwhich they have said and not to an objection which\nhas been invented by ourselves; or again, this will\nbe possible if the case is of such a nature that we\n\n\n\nare in a position to state certain definite objections\nwhich are absolutely essential to our opponent's case:\nfor instance, if stolen goods have been discovered\nin a house, the accused must of necessity allege\neither that they were brought there without his\nknowledge or deposited with him or given to him\nand we may therefore answer all these points even\nalthough they have not been put forward. On the\nother hand, in the schools we are quite justified in\nanswering both statements and imaginary objections; for by these means we shall train ourselves\nat one and the same time for speaking either first or\nsecond.

There are two kinds of\nperoration, for it may deal either with facts or with\nthe emotional aspect of the case. The repetition\nand grouping of the facts, which the Greeks call\n and some of our own writers call the\nenumeration, serves both to refresh the memory of\nthe judge and to place the whole of the case before\nhis eyes, and, even although the facts may have\nmade little impression on him in detail, their cumulative effect is considerable. This final recapitulation must be as brief as possible and, as the\nGreek term indicates, we must summarise the facts\nunder the appropriate heads. For if we devote\ntoo much time thereto, the peroration will cease\nto be an enumeration and will constitute something very like a second speech. On the other\nhand the points selected for enumeration must\nbe treated with weight and dignity, enlivened\nby apt reflexions and diversified by suitable figures;\nfor there is nothing more tiresome than a dry repetition of facts, which merely suggests a lack of\nconfidence in the judges' memory. There are however innumerable ways in which this may be done.\nThe finest example is provided by Cicero's prosecution of Verres.  Then follows the\n\n\n\nenumeration. Another admirable example may be found\nin the same speech where the enumeration of the\ntemples which the praetor had despoiled takes the\nform of invoking the various deities concerned. We\nmay also at times pretend to be in doubt whether\nwe have not omitted something and to wonder what\nthe accused will say in reply to certain points or\nwhat hope tile accuser can have after the manner in\nwhich we have refuted all the charges brought against\nus. But the most attractive form of peroration is\nthat which we may use when we have an opportunity of drawing some argument from our opponent's\nspeech, as for instance when we say  or  or  But I must refrain from dealing with the various methods individually, for fear\nthat the instances that I produce should be regarded\nas exhaustive, whereas our opportunities spring from\nthe nature of the particular case, from the statements\nof our opponents and also from fortuitous circumstances. Nor must we restrict ourselves to recapitulating the points of our own speech, but must call\nupon our opponent to reply to certain questions.\nThis however is only possible if there is time for him\nto do so and if the arguments which we have put\nforward are such as not to admit of refutation. For\nto challenge points which tell in our opponent's\nfavour is not to argue against him, but to play the\npart of prompter to him. The majority of Athenians\nand almost all philosophers who have left anything\nin writing on the art of oratory have held that the\nrecapitulation is the sole form of peroration. I\n\n\n\nimagine that the reason why the Athenians did so\nwas that appeals to the emotions were forbidden to\nAthenian orators, a proclamation to this effect being\nactually made by the court-usher. I am less surprised at the philosophers taking this view, for they\nregard susceptibility to emotion as a vice, and think\nit immoral that the judge should be distracted from\nthe truth by an appeal to his emotions and that\nit is unbecoming for a good man to make use of\nvicious procedure to serve his ends. None the less\nthey must admit that appeals to emotion are necessary if there are no other means for securing the\nvictory of truth, justice and the public interest. It\nis however admitted by all that recapitulation may\nbe profitably employed in other portions of the\nspeech as well, if the case is complicated and a\nnumber of different arguments have been employed\nin the defence; though no one will doubt but that\nthere are many cases, in which no recapitulation at\nall is necessary at any point, assuming, that is, that\nthe cases are both brief and simple.

There are however certain things\nwhich require fuller treatment in the peroration\nthan in the exordium, where it is sufficient merely to\noutline them. This fuller treatment is specially\nrequired if the accused be a man of violent, unpopular or dangerous character or if the\n\n\n\ncondemnation of the accused is likely to cover the judges with\nglory or his acquittal with disgrace. Calvus for\nexample in his speech against Vatinius makes an\nadmirable remark:  Cicero again in the \nsays that the ill-name acquired by the courts may\nbe effaced by the condemnation of Verres, a statement that comes under the head of the conciliatory\nmethods mentioned above. The appeal to tear also,\nif it is necessary to employ it to produce a like effect,\noccupies a more prominent place in the peroration\nthan in the exordium, but I have expressed my views\non this subject in an earlier book. The peroration\nalso provides freer opportunities for exciting the\npassions of jealousy, hatred or anger. As regards the\ncircumstances likely to excite such feelings in the\njudge, jealousy will be produced by the influence of\nthe accused, hatred by the disgraceful nature of his\nconduct, and anger by his disrespectful attitude to\nthe court, if, for instance, he be contumacious,\narrogant or studiously indifferent: such anger may be\naroused not merely by specific acts or words, but by\nhis looks, bearing and manner. In this connexion\nthe remark made by the accuser of Cossutianus\nCapito in my young days was regarded with great\napproval: the words used were Greek, but may be\ntranslated thus:\nThe best way however for the accuser to excite the\nfeelings of the judge is to make the charge which he\nbrings against the accused seem as atrocious or, if\nfeasible, as deplorable as possible. Its atrocity may\nbe enhanced by considerations of the nature of\nthe act, the position of its author or the victim, the\n\n\n\npurpose, time, place and manner of the act: all of\nwhich may be treated with infinite variety. Suppose\nthat we are complaining that our client has been\nbeaten. We must first speak of the act itself; we\nshall then proceed to point out that the victim was\nan old man, a child, a magistrate, an honest man or\na benefactor to the state; we shall also point out\nthat the assailant was a worthless and contemptible\nfellow, or (to take the opposite case) was in a\nposition of excessive power or was the last man who\nshould have given the blow, or again that the\noccasion was a solemn festival, or that the act was\ncommitted at a time when such crimes were\npunished with special severity by the courts or when\npublic order was at a dangerously low ebb. Again\nthe hatred excited by the act will be enhanced if it\nwas committed in the theatre, in a temple, or at\na public assembly, and if the blow was given not\nin mistake or in a moment of passion or, if it\nwas the result of passion which was quite unjustifiable, being due to the fact that the victim\nhad gone to the assistance of his father or had\nmade some reply or was a candidate for the same\noffice as his assailant; or finally we may hint that\nhe wished to inflict more serious injury than he\nsucceeded in inflicting. But it is the manner of the\nact that contributes most to the impression of its\natrocity, if, for example, the blow was violent or insulting: thus Demosthenes seeks to excite hatred\nagainst Midias by emphasising the position of the\nblow, the attitude of the assailant and the expression\nof his face. It is in this connexion that we shall\nhave to consider whether a man was killed by sword\nor fire or poison, by one wound or several, and\n\n\n\nwhether he was slain on the spot or tortured by\nbeing kept in suspense. The accuser will also\nfrequently attempt to excite pity by complaining of\nthe fate of the man whom he is seeking to avenge or\nof the desolation which has fallen upon his children\nor parents. The judges may also be moved by drawing a picture of the future, of the fate which awaits\nthose who have complained of violence and wrong,\nif they fail to secure justice. They must go into exile,\ngive up their property or endure to the end whatever their enemy may choose to inflict upon them.\nBut it will more frequently be the duty of the\naccuser to divert the judge from all the temptations\nto pity which the accused will place before him, and\nto incite him to give a strong and dispassionate\nverdict. It will also be his duty in this connexion\nto forestall the arguments and actions to which his\nopponent seems likely to have recourse. For it\nmakes the judge more cautious in observing the\nsanctity of his oath and destroys the influence of\nthose who are going to reply to us when the arguments used by the defence have already been dealt\nwith by the prosecution, since they lose their novelty.\nAn instance of this will be found in the speech of\nMessala against Aufidia, where he warns Servius\nSulpicius not to talk about the peril which\nthreatens the signatories to the document and the\ndefendant herself. Again Aesehines foretells the\nline of defence which Demosthenes will pursue.\nThere are also occasions when the judges should be\ntold what answer they should make to requests on\nbehalf of the accused, a proceeding which is a form\nof recapitulation."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.397"}, {"@id": "p.399"}], "note": ["See iv. i. 69.", "xxxvii. 102."], "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Milone,"}, "quote": "Alas, unhappy that I am!

Again, the cause which has brought\nthe accused into peril may serve to produce the\nsame effect, if, for example, it appears that he has\nincurred enmity on account of some honourable\naction: above all his goodness, humanity or pity\nmay be emphasised with this end in view.

Such appeals to pity\nwill be based either on the previous or present\nsufferings of the accused, or on those which await\nhim if condemned.

The\nimpression produced by such exhibitions is generally\nenormous, since they seem to bring the spectators\nface to face with the cruel facts. For example, the\nsight of the bloodstains on the purple-bordered toga\nof Gaius Caesar, which was carried at the head of\nhis funeral procession, aroused the Roman people to\nfury. They knew that he had been killed; they\nhad even seen his body stretched upon the bier:\nbut his garment, still wet with his blood, brought\nsuch a vivid image of the crime before their minds,\nthat Caesar seemed not to have been murdered, but\nto be being murdered before their very eyes.

Those however who cannot get away\nfrom what they have written, are reduced to silence\nby such emergencies or else led into making false\nstatements, as for instance if an advocate should say,\n or  or  although the person in question is doing\nnone of these things. Such faults are due to the\npractice of the schools, where we are free to feign\nwhat we will with impunity, because we are at\nliberty to invent facts. But this is impossible when\nwe are confronted with realities, and it was an\nexcellent remark that Cassius made to a young\norator who said,  To which he replied,  And he fixed his eyes on him with\nthe most ferocious scowl that he could muster.\nThere is one point which it is specially important to\n\n\n\nremember, that we should never attempt to move our\naudience to tears without drawing on all the resources\nof our eloquence. For while this form of emotional\nappeal is the most effective of all, when successful,\nits failure results in anti-climax, and if the pleader is\na feeble speaker he would have been wiser to leave\nthe pathos of the situation to the imagination of the\njudges. For look and voice and even the expression\non the face of the accused to which the attention of\nthe court is drawn will generally awaken laughter\nwhere they fail to awaken compassion. Therefore\nthe pleader must measure and make a careful\nestimate of his powers, and must have a just comprehension of the difficulty of the task which he\ncontemplates.

Even a slight and limited talent may,\nwith the assistance of practice or learning, perhaps\nsucceed in giving life to other departments of oratory,\nand in developing them to a serviceable extent. At\nany rate there are, and have always been, a\n\n\n\nconsiderable number of pleaders capable of discovering\narguments adequate to prove their points. I am far\nfrom despising such, but I consider that their utility\nis restricted to providing the judge with such facts\nas it is necessary for him to know, and, to be quite\nfrank, I regard them merely as suitable persons to\ninstruct pleaders of real eloquence in the facts of\na case. But few indeed are those orators who can\nsweep the judge with them, lead him to adopt\nthat attitude of mind which they desire, and compel\nhim to weep with them or share their anger. And\nyet it is this emotional power that dominates\nthe court, it is this form of eloquence that is the\nqueen of all. For as a rule arguments arise out of\nthe case itself, and the better cause has always the\nlarger number to support it, so that the party who\nwills by means of them will have no further satisfaction than that of knowing that his advocate did not\nfail him. But the peculiar task of the orator arises\nwhen the minds of the judges require force to move\nthem, and their thoughts have actually to be led away\nfrom the contemplation of the truth. No instruction\nfrom the litigant can secure this, nor can such power\nbe acquired merely by the study of a brief. Proofs, it\nis true, may induce the judges to regard our case\nas superior to that of our opponent, but the appeal\nto the emotions will do more, for it will make them\nwish our case to be the better. And what they\nwish, they will also believe. For as soon as they\nbegin to be angry, to feel favourably disposed, to\nhate or pity, they begin to take a personal interest\nin the case, and just as lovers are incapable of\nforming a reasoned judgment on the beauty of the\nobject of their affections, because passion forestalls\n\n\n\nthe sense of sight, so the judge, when overcome by\nhis emotions, abandons all attempt to enquire into\nthe truth of the arguments, is swept along by the\ntide of passion, and yields himself unquestioning to\nthe torrent. Thus the verdict of the court shows\nhow much weight has been carried by the arguments\nand the evidence; but when the judge has been\nreally moved by the orator he reveals his feelings\nwhile he is still sitting and listening to the case.\nWhen those tears, which are the aim of most perorations, well forth from his eyes, is he not giving his\nverdict for all to see? It is to this, therefore, that\nthe orator must devote all his powers,\n\n\n\nWithout this all else is bare and meagre, weak and\ndevoid of charm.

But close\nconsideration of the nature of the subject leads me\nto think that in this connexion it is not so much\n in general that is meant as certain peculiar\naspects; for the term  includes every attitude\nof the mind. The more cautious writers have preferred to give the sense of the term rather than to\ntranslate it into Latin. They therefore explain \n\n\n\nas describing the more violent emotions and  as\ndesignating those which are calm and gentle: in the\none case the passions are violent, in the other subdued, the former command and disturb, the latter\npersuade and induce a feeling of goodwill. Some\nadd that  is continuous, while  is momentary. While admitting that this is usually the ease,\nI still hold that there are some subjects which\ndemand that the more violent emotion should be\ncontinuous. But, although the gentler emotions\nrequire less force and impetus, they call for no less\nart and experience than the more vehement, and are\ndemanded in a greater number of cases, indeed in a\ncertain sense they are required in all.

The  which I have in my mind\nand which I desiderate in an orator is commended\nto our approval by goodness more than aught else\nand is not merely calm and mild, but in most cases\n\n\n\ningratiating and courteous and such as to excite\npleasure and affection in our hearers, while the chief\nmerit in its expression lies in making it seem that\nall that we say derives directly from the nature of\nthe facts and persons concerned and in the revelation of the character of the orator in such a way that\nall may recognise it. This kind of  should be\nespecially displayed in cases where the persons concerned are intimately connected, whenever we\ntolerate or pardon any act or offer satisfaction or\nadmonition, in all of which cases there should be no\ntrace of anger or hatred. On the other hand the\nmoderation shown by a father to his son, a guardian\nto his ward or a husband to his wife will differ from\nthat which is shown by an old man to a youthful\nstranger who has insulted him or by a man of high\nrank to his inferior, since in the former cases they\nemphasise their affection for the wrongdoer and\nthere is no desire to do anything that will excite\ndislike against them save by the manifestation of\nthe fact that they still love them; while in the one\ncase the offended party should be no more than provoked, in the other he should he really deeply moved.\nOf the same character, though less violent, is the\nemotion to be shown when we ask pardon for the\nerrors of the young, or apologise for some youthful\namour.

For the very fact of our\nyielding serves to demonstrate their insupportable\narrogance, while orators who have a passion for abuse\nor are given to affect freedom of speech fail to realise\nthat it is a far more effective course to make your\nantagonist unpopular than to abuse him.

But\nmy design is to bring to light the secret principles\nof this art, and to open up the inmost recesses of\nthe subject, giving the result not of teaching received from others, but of my own experience and\nthe guidance of nature herself. The prime essential\nfor stirring the emotions of others is, in my opinion,\n\n\n\nfirst to feel those emotions oneself. It is sometimes\npositively ridiculous to counterfeit grief, anger and\nindignation, if we content ourselves with accommodating our words and looks and make no attempt\nto adapt our own feelings to the emotions to be\nexpressed. What other reason is there for the\neloquence with which mourners express their grief;\nor for the fluency which anger lends even to the\nuneducated, save the fact that their minds are\nstirred to power by the depth and sincerity of their\nfeelings? Consequently, if we wish to give our\nwords the appearance of sincerity, we must assimilate\nourselves to the emotions of those who are genuinely\nso affected, and our eloquence must spring from the\nsame feeling that we desire to produce in the mind\nof the judge. Will he grieve who can find no trace\nof grief in the words with which I seek to move\nhim to grief? Will he be angry, if the orator who\nseeks to kindle his anger shows no sign of labouring\nunder the emotion which he demands from his\naudience? Will he shed tears if the pleader's eyes\nare dry? It is utterly impossible. Fire alone can\nkindle, and moisture alone can wet, nor can one\nthing impart any colour to another save that which\nit possesses itself. Accordingly, the first essential\nis that those feelings should prevail with us that\nwe wish to prevail with the judge, and that we\nshould be moved ourselves before we attempt to\nmove others. But how are we to generate these\nemotions in ourselves, since emotion is not in our\nown power? I will try to explain as best I may. There\nare certain experiences which the Greeks call  and the Romans  whereby things absent\nare presented to our imagination with such extreme\n\n\n\nvividness that they seem actually to be before\nour very eyes. It is the man who is really sensitive to such impressions who will have the greatest\npower over the emotions. Some writers describe\nthe possessor of this power of vivid imagination,\nwhereby things, words and actions are presented\nin the most realistic manner, by the Greek word\n and it is a power which all may\nreadily acquire if they will. When the mind is unoccupied or is absorbed by fantastic hopes or daydreams, we are haunted by these visions of which\nI am speaking to such an extent that we imagine\nthat we are travelling abroad, crossing the sea, fighting, addressing the people, or enjoying the use of\nwealth that we do not actually possess, and seem\nto ourselves not to be dreaming but acting.

Shall I not bring before my\neyes all the circumstances which it is reasonable to\nimagine must have occurred in such a connexion?\nShall I not see the assassin burst suddenly from his\nhiding-place, the victim tremble, cry for help, beg\nfor mercy, or turn to run?

I have often\nseen actors, both in tragedy and comedy, leave the\ntheatre still drowned in tears after concluding the\nperformance of some moving role. But if the mere\ndelivery of words written by another has the power\nto set our souls on fire with fictitious emotions, what\nwill the orator do whose duty it is to picture to\nhimself the facts and who has it in his power to feel\nthe same emotion as his client whose interests are\nat stake?Even in the schools it is desirable that\nthe student should be moved by his theme, and\nshould imagine it to be true; indeed, it is all the\nmore desirable then, since, as a rule in scholastic\n\n\n\ndeclamations, the speaker more often appears as the\nactual litigant than as his advocate.

I have thought it necessary not\nto conceal these considerations from my reader, since\nthey have contributed to the acquisition of such\nreputation for talent as I possess or once possessed.\nI have frequently been so much moved while speaking, that I have not merely been wrought upon to\ntears, but have turned pale and shown all the\nsymptoms of genuine grief."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.441"}, {"@id": "p.443"}], "note": {"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "De Or."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "De Or."}], "#text": "II. lviii. 236.\nWhere?

How hard it\nis to attain success in this connexion is shown by\nthe cases of the two great masters of Greek and\nRoman oratory. For many think that Demosthenes\nwas deficient in this faculty, and that Cicero used\nit without discrimination. Indeed, it is impossible\nto suppose that Demosthenes deliberately avoided\nall display of humour, since his few jests are so\nunworthy of his other excellences that they clearly\nshow that he lacked the power, not merely that he\ndisliked to use it. Cicero, on the other hand, was\nregarded as being unduly addicted to jests, not\nmerely outside the courts, but in his actual speeches\nas well. Personally (though whether I am right in\nthis view, or have been led astray by an exaggerated\nadmiration for the prince of orators, I cannot say),\n\n\n\nI regard him as being the possessor of a remarkable\nturn of wit. For his daily speech was full of humour,\nwhile in his disputes in court and in his examination\nof witnesses he produced more good jests than any\nother, while the somewhat insipid jokes which he\nlaunches against Verres are always attributed by him\nto others and produced as evidence: wherefore, the\nmore vulgar they are, the more probable is it that\nthey are not the invention of the orator, but were\ncurrent as public property. I wish, however, that\nTiro, or whoever it may have been that published\nthe three books of Cicero's jests, had restricted their\nnumber and had shown more judgment in selecting\nthan zeal in collecting them. For he would then\nhave been less exposed to the censure of his calumniators, although the latter will, in any case, as in\nregard to all the manifestations of his genius, find\nit easier to detect superfluities than deficiencies.\nThe chief difficulty which confronts the orator in\nthis connexion lies in the fact that sayings designed\nto raise a laugh are generally untrue (and falsehood\nalways involves a certain meanness), and are often\ndeliberately distorted, and, further, never complimentary: while the judgments formed by the audience\non such jests will necessarily vary, since the effect of\na jest depends not on the reason, but on an emotion\nwhich it is difficult, if not impossible, to describe. For\nI do not think that anybody can give an adequate\nexplanation, though many have attempted to do so, of\nthe cause of laughter, which is excited not merely\nby words or deeds, but sometimes even by touch.\nMoreover, there is great variety in the things which\nraise a laugh, since we laugh not merely at those\nwords or actions which are smart or witty, but also\n\n\n\nat those which reveal folly, anger or fear. Consequently, the cause of laughter is uncertain, since\nlaughter is never far removed from derision. For,\nas Cicero says,  and whereas,\nwhen we point to such a blemish in others, the\nresult is known as wit, it is called folly when the\nsame jest is turned against ourselves."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}], "note": "Where?", "quote": "Yes, and if the bottle hadn't\nbeen empty, we should have killed you!", "#text": "Now, though laughter may be regarded as a trivial\nmatter, and an emotion frequently awakened by\nbuffoons, actors or fools, it has a certain imperious\nforce of its own which it is very hard to resist.

Again,\nit frequently turns the scale in matters of great\nimportance, as I have already observed: for instance,\nit often dispels hatred or anger. A proof of this is\ngiven by the story of the young men of Tarentum,\nwho had made a number of scurrilous criticisms of\nPyrrhus over the dinner table: they were called\nupon to answer for their statements, and, since the\ncharge was one that admitted neither of denial nor\nof excuse, they succeeded in escaping, thanks to a\nhappy jest which made the king laugh: for one of\nthe accused said,  a jest\nwhich succeeded in dissipating the animosity which\nthe charge had aroused."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.445"}, {"@id": "p.447"}], "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "mots,"}, "note": "The meaning of this passage is not clear, and no satisfactory explanation or correction has been suggested.", "#text": "Still, whatever the essence of humour may be, and\nalthough I would not venture to assert that it is altogether independent of art (for it involves a certain\npower of observation, and rules for its employment\nhave been laid down by writers both of Greece and\n\n\n\nRome), I will insist on this much, that it depends\nmainly on nature and opportunity. The influence\nof nature consists not merely in the fact that one\nman is quicker or cleverer than another in the\ninvention of jests (for such a power can be increased\nby teaching), but also in the possession of some\npeculiar charm of look or manner, the effect of which\nis such that the same remarks would be less entertaining if uttered by another.

It has the same primary\ndivision as other departments of oratory, that is to\nsay, it is concerned with things and words. The\napplication of humour to oratory may be divided\ninto three heads: for there are three things out of\nwhich we may seek to raise a laugh, to wit, others,\nourselves, or things intermediate. In the first case\nwe either reprove or refute or make light of or\nretort or deride the arguments of others. In the\n\n\n\nsecond we speak of things which concern ourselves in a humorous manner and, to quote the\nwords of Cicero, say things which have a suggestion of absurdity. For there are certain sayings\nwhich are regarded as folly if they slip from us\nunawares, but as witty if uttered ironically. The\nthird kind consists, as Cicero also tells us, in cheating\nexpectations, in taking words in a different sense\nfrom what was intended, and in other things which\naffect neither party to the suit, and which I have,\ntherefore, styled intermediate. Further, things designed to raise a laugh may either be said or done.\nIn the latter case laughter is sometimes caused by\nan act possessing a certain element of seriousness\nas well, as in the case of Marcus Caelius the praetor,\nwho, when the consul Isauricus broke his curule\nchair, had another put in its place, the seat of which\nwas made of leather thongs, by way of allusion to\nthe story that the consul had once been scourged\nby his father: sometimes, again, it is aroused by\nan act which passes the grounds of decency, as in\nthe case of Caelius' box, a jest which was not fit\nfor an orator or any respectable man to make. On\nthe other hand the joke may lie in some remark\nabout a ridiculous look or gesture; such jests are\nvery attractive, more especially when delivered with\nevery appearance of seriousness; for there are no\njests so insipid as those which parade the fact that\nthey are intended to be witty. Still, although the\ngravity with which a jest is uttered increases its\nattraction, and the mere fact that the speaker does\nnot laugh himself makes his words laughable, there\nis also such a thing as a humorous look, manner or\n\n\n\ngesture, provided always that they observe the happy\nmean. Further, a jest will either be free and lively,\nlike the majority of those uttered by Aulus Galba,\nor abusive, like those with which Junius Bassus\nrecently made us familiar, or bitter, like those of\nCassius Severus, or gentle, like those of Domitius\nAfer. Much depends on the occasion on which a\njest is uttered. For in social gatherings and the intercourse of every day a certain freedom is not unseemly\nin persons of humble rank, while liveliness is becoming to all. Our jests should never be designed\nto wound, and we should never make it our ideal\nto lose a friend sooner than lose a jest. Where the\nbattles of the courts are concerned I am always\nbetter pleased when it is possible to indulge in\ngentle raillery, although it is, of course, permissible\nto be abusive or bitter in the words we use against\nour opponents, just as it is permissible to accuse\nthem openly of crime, and to demand the last penalty\nof the law. But in the courts as elsewhere it is\nregarded as inhuman to hit a man when he is down,\neither because he is the innocent victim of misfortune or because such attacks may recoil on those\nwho make them. Consequently, the first points to\nbe taken into consideration are who the speaker\nis, what is the nature of the case, who is the judge,\nwho is the victim, and what is the character of\nthe remarks that are made. It is most unbecoming\nfor an orator to distort his features or use uncouth\ngestures, tricks that arouse such merriment in farce.\nNo less unbecoming are ribald jests, and such as\nare employed upon the stage. As for obscenity, it\nshould not merely be banished from his language,\nbut should not even be suggested. For even if our\n\n\n\nopponent has rendered himself liable to such a\ncharge, our denunciation should not take the form\nof a jest. Further, although I want my orator to\nspeak with wit, he must not give the impression of\nstriving after it. Consequently lie must not display\nhis wit on every possible occasion, but must sacrifice\na jest sooner than sacrifice his dignity. Again, no\none will endure an accuser who employs jests to\nseason a really horrible case, nor an advocate for the\ndefence who makes merry over one that calls for pity.\nMoreover, there is a type of judge whose temperament is too serious to allow him to tolerate laughter.\nIt may also happen that a jest directed against an\nopponent may apply to the judge or to our own client,\nalthough there are some orators who do not refrain\neven from jests that may recoil upon themselves.\nThis was the case with Sulpicius Longus, who,\ndespite the fact that he was himself surpassingly\nhideous, asserted of a man against whom he was\nappearing in a case involving his status as a free\nman, that even his face was the face of a slave. To\nthis Domitius Afer replied,  Insolence and arrogance are likewise to\nbe avoided, nor must our jests seem unsuitable to\nthe time or place, or give the appearance of studied\npremeditation, or smell of the lamp, while those\ndirected against the unfortunate are, as I have\nalready said, inhuman. Again, some advocates are\nmen of such established authority and such known\nrespectability, that any insolence shown them\nwould only hurt the assailant. As regards the\nway in which we should deal with friends I have\nalready given instructions. It is the duty not merely\n\n\n\nof an orator, but of any reasonable human being,\nwhen attacking one whom it is dangerous to offend\nto take care that his remarks do not end in exciting\nserious enmity, or the necessity for a grovelling\napology. Sarcasm that applies to a number of\npersons is injudicious: I refer to cases where it is\ndirected against whole nations or classes of society,\nor against rank and pursuits which are common to\nmany. A good man will see that everything he\nsays is consistent with his dignity and the respectability of his character; for we pay too dear for the\nlaugh we raise if it is at the cost of our own integrity."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "36"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "37"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "38"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "39"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "40"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "41"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "42"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "43"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "44"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "reflexions,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "mot."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Cluentio,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Oratore,"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.459"}, {"@id": "p.461"}, {"@id": "p.463"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Or."}, "#text": "Cic.

To attempt to deal exhaustively with the\nsubject would be an interminable task and a waste\nof labour. For the topics suitable to jests are no\nless numerous than those from which we may derive\n as they are called, and are, moreover,\nidentical with the latter. The powers of invention\nand expression come into play no less where jests\nare concerned, while as regards expression its force\nwill depend in part on the choice of words, in part\non the figures employed. Laughter then will be\nderived either from the physical appearance of our\nopponent or from his character as revealed in his\nwords and actions, or from external sources; for all\nforms of raillery come under one or other of these\nheads; if the raillery is serious, we style it as\nsevere; if, on the other hand, it is of a lighter\ncharacter, we regard it as humorous. These themes\nfor jest may be pointed out to the eye or described\nin words or indicated by some  It is only on\n\n\n\nrare occasions that it is possible to make them\nvisible to the eye, as Gaius Julius did when Helvius Mancia kept clamouring against him.  he cried, and then, as\nMancia persisted in asking him to do so, pointed\nwith his finger at the picture of a Gaul painted on\na Cimbric shield, a figure to which Mancia bore a\nstriking resemblance. There were shops round the\nforum and the shield had been hung up over one\nof them by way of a sign. The narration of a\nhumorous story may often be used with clever effect\nand is a device eminently becoming to an orator.\nGood examples are the story told of Caepasius and\nFabricius, which Cicero tells in the  or\nthe story told by Caelius of the dispute between\nDecimus Laelius and his colleague when they were\nboth in a hurry to reach their province first. But\nin all such cases the whole narrative must possess\nelegance and charm, while the orator's own contribution to the story should be the most humorous\nelement. Take for instance the way in which Cicero\ngives a special relish to the flight of Fabricius.\n I will not quote the rest of the passage,\nfor it is well known. But he develops the theme\n\n\n\nstill further although the plain facts amount simply\nto this, that Fabricius had left the court. The\nwhole of the story told by Caelius is full of wit and\ninvention, but the gem of the passage is its conclusion.  Cicero\nthinks that humour belongs to narrative and wit to\nsallies against the speaker's antagonist. Domitius\nAfer showed remarkable finish in this department;\nfor, while narratives of the kind I have described\nare frequent in his speeches, several books have been\npublished of his witticisms as well. This latter form\nof wit lies not merely in sallies and brief displays of\nwit, but may be developed at greater length, witness\nthe story told by Cicero in the second book of his\n in which Lucius Crassus dealt with\nBrutus, against whom he was appearing in court.\nBrutus was prosecuting Cnaeus Plancus and had\nproduced two readers to show that Lucius Crassus,\nwho was counsel for the defence, in the speech\nwhich he delivered on the subject of the colony of\nNarbo had advocated measures contrary to those\nwhich he recommended in speaking of the Servilian\nlaw. Crassus, in reply, called for three readers and\ngave them the dialogues of Brutus' father to read\nout. One of these dialogues was represented as\ntaking place on his estate at Privernum, the second\non his estate at Alba, and the third on his estate at\nTibur. Crassus then asked where these estates were.\nNow Brutus had sold them all, and in those days it\nwas considered somewhat discreditable to sell one's\n\n\n\npaternal acres. Similar attractive effects of narrative\nmay be produced by the narration of fables or at\ntimes even of historical anecdotes."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "45"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "46"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "47"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "48"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "49"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "50"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "51"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "52"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "53"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "54"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "55"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "56"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "doubles\nentendres"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Ego quoque tibi favebo."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ludus,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "magisiri"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "metalepsis,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "congiaria"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "heminaria:"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "congiarium"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "satagere"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Caecina"}], "note": [{"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "coque"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "quoque,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "I will support you, cook, or I too\nwill support you."}], "#text": "The pun is untranslatable, turning as it does on the\nsimilarity of sound between  and  so that the\nsentence might mean either"}, {"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Varium"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "unstable"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "mottled,"}], "#text": "Here again the pun is virtually untranslatable. \nis used in the double sense of  or  with\nreference to the story that he had been scourged by his\nfather.

It may be employed in two ways,\naccording as we are the aggressors, or are replying\nto our opponents; the method, however, in both\ncases is to some extent the same. For there is\nnothing that can be said in attack that cannot\nbe used in riposte. But there are certain points\nwhich are peculiar to reply. For remarks designed\nfor attack are usually brought ready-made into\ncourt, after long thought at home, whereas those\nmade in reply are usually improvised during a dispute or the cross-examination of witnesses. But\nthough there are many topics on which we may\ndraw for our jests, I must repeat that not all these\ntopics are becoming to orators: above all  and obscenity, such as is dear to the Atellan\nfarce, are to be avoided, as also are those coarse\njibes so common on the lips of the rabble, where\nthe ambiguity of words is turned to the service of\nabuse. I cannot even approve of a similar from of\njest, that sometimes slipped out even from Cicero,\nthough not when he was pleading in the courts:\nfor example, once when a candidate, alleged to be\nthe son of a cook, solicited someone else's vote in\nhis presence, he said,  I say\nthis not because I object absolutely to all play on\nwords capable of two different meanings, but because\nsuch jests are rarely effective, unless they are helped\nout by actual facts as well as similarity of sound.\n\n\n\nFor example, I regard the jest which Cicero levelled\nagainst that same Isauricus, whom I mentioned\nabove, as being little less than sheer buffoonery.\n he said,  On the other hand, the following\ninstance of the same type of wit is quite admirable:\nwhen Milo's accuser, by way of proving that he had\nlain in wait for Clodius, alleged that he had put up\nat Bovillae before the ninth hour in order to wait\nuntil Clodius left his villa, and kept repeating the\nquestion, , Cicero replied,  a retort which in itself justifies us\nin refusing to exclude this type of wit altogether.\nSometimes, too, the same word may be used not\nmerely in several senses, but in absolutely opposite\nsenses. For example, Nero said of a dishonest\nslave,  Such ambiguity may even go so far as to present all the\nappearance of a riddle, witness the jest that Cicero\nmade at the expense of Pletorius, the accuser of\nFonteius:  he said, \nThe explanation is that in her lifetime women\nof infamous character used to frequent her\nhouse, while after her death her property was\nsold. (I may note however that  is used\nmetaphorically in the sense of school, while\n is used ambiguously.) A similar form of\n\n\n\njest may be made by use of the figure known as\n as when Fabius Maximus complained of\nthe meagreness of the gifts made by Augustus to\nhis friends, and said that his  were  for  implies at once liberality and\na particular measure, and Fabius put a slight on the\nliberality of Augustus by a reference to the measure.\nThis form of jest is as poor as is the invention of\npunning names by the addition, subtraction or change\nof letters: I find, for instance, a case where a certain\nAcisculus was called Pacisculus because of some\n which he had made, while one Placidus\nwas nicknamed Acidus because of his  temper,\nand one Tullius was dubbed Tollius because he was\na thief. Such puns are more successful with things\nthan names. It was, for example, a neat hit of\nAfer's when he said that Manlius Sura, who kept\nrushing to and fro while he was pleading, waving\nhis hands, letting his toga fall and replacing it, was\nnot merely pleading, but giving himself a lot of\nneedless trouble. For there is a spice of wit about\nthe word  in itself, even if there were no\nresemblance to any other word. Similar jests may\nbe produced by the addition or removal of the\naspirate, or by splitting up a word or joining it to\nanother: the effect is generally poor, but the practice\nis occasionally permissible. Jests drawn from names\nare of the same type. Cicero introduces a number\nof such jests against Verres, but always as quotations\n\n\n\nfrom others. On one occasion he says that he\nwould sweep everything away, for his name was\nVerres; on another, that he had given more trouble\nto Hercules, whose temple he had pillaged, than\nwas given by the Erymanthine ; on another,\nthat he was a bad  who had left so worthless\na pig behind him. For Verres' predecessor was\nnamed Sacerdos.

But such jests may be drawn not\nmerely from the names of men, but from animals as\nwell; for example when I was a boy, Junius Bassus,\none of the wittiest of men, was nicknamed the white\nass. And Sarmentus compared Messius Cicirrus\nto a wild horse. The comparison may also be\ndrawn from inanimate objects: for example Publius\nBlessius called a certain Julius, who was dark, lean\nand bent, the iron buckle. This method of raising\na laugh is much in vogue to-day. Such resemblances\n\n\n\nmay be put to the service of wit either openly or\nallusively. Of the latter type is the remark of\nAugustus, made to a soldier who showed signs of\ntimidity in presenting a petition,  Some\nof these jests turn on similarity of meaning. Of\nthis kind was the witticism uttered by Vatinius when\nhe was prosecuted by Calvus. Vatinius was wiping\nhis forehead with a white handkerchief, and his\naccuser called attention to the unseemliness of the\nact. Whereupon Vatinius replied,  Still more ingenious is the application of\none thing to another on the ground of some resemblance, that is to say the adaptation to one thing of\na circumstance which usually applies to something\nelse, a type of jest which we may regard as being an\ningenious form of fiction. For example, when ivory\nmodels of captured towns were carried in Caesar's\ntriumphal procession, and a few days later wooden\nmodels of the same kind were carried at the triumph\nof Fabius Maximus, Chrysippus remarked that the\nlatter were the cases for Caesar's ivory towns. And\nPedo said of a heavy-armed gladiator who was\npursuing another armed with a net and failed to\nstrike him,  Resemblance and ambiguity may be used in conjunction:\nGalba for example said to a man who stood very\nmuch at his ease when playing ball,  The\n\n\n\nambiguity lies in the word  while the indifference\nshewn by the player supplies the resemblance. I\nneed say no more on this form of humour. But the\npractice of combining different types of jest is very\ncommon, and those are best which are of this composite character. A like use may be made of dissimilarity. Thus a Roman knight was once drinking\nat tile games, and Augustus sent him the following\nmessage,  To which\nthe other replied,  Contraries give rise to more than\none kind of jest.

And\n\n\n\nas a matter of fact his work was not designed to deal\nwith humour, but with  a quality which\nhe regards as peculiar to this city, though it was not\ntill a late period that it was understood in this sense,\nafter the word  had come to be accepted as indicating Rome without the addition of any proper\nnoun. He defines it as follows:  But this\ndefinition, if we except the quality of brevity, includes all the virtues of oratory. For it is entirely\nconcerned with persons and things to deal with\nwhich in appropriate language is nothing more nor\nless than the task of perfect eloquence. Why he\ninsisted on brevity being essential I do not know,\nsince in the same book he asserts that many speakers\nhave revealed their  in narrative. And a little\nlater he gives the following definition, which is, as\nhe says, based on the views expressed by Cato:\n But if we\naccept these definitions, we shall have to allow the\ntitle of  to anything that is well said. It was\nnatural therefore that the author of this definition\nshould classify such sayings under three heads,\nserious, humorous and intermediate, since all good\n\n\n\nsayings may be thus classified. But, in my opinion,\nthere are certain forms of humorous saying that may\nbe regarded as not possessing sufficient  For\nto my thinking  involves the total absence of\nall that is incongruous, coarse, unpolished and exotic\nwhether in thought, language, voice or gesture, and\nresides not so much in isolated sayings as in the\nwhole complexion of our language, just as for the\nGreeks  means that elegance of taste which\nwas peculiar to Athens. However, out of respect to\nthe judgment of Marsus, who was a man of the\ngreatest learning, I will add that he divides serious\nutterances into three classes, the honorific, the\nderogatory and the intermediate. As an example\nof the honorific he quotes the words uttered by\nCicero in the  with reference to Caesar,\n The\nderogatory he illustrates by the words used by\nCicero of Pompey and Caesar in a letter to Atticus:\n Finally, he illustrates the intermediate, which he calls apophthegmatic (as it is), by\nthe passage from Cicero's speech against Catiline\nwhere he says,  All these\nare admirable sayings, but what special title they\nhave to be called  I do not see. If it is\nnot merely, as I think, the whole complexion of\nour oratory that deserves this title, but if it is to\nbe claimed for individual sayings as well, I should\ngive the name only to those sayings that are of\nthe same general character as humorous sayings,\nwithout actually being humorous. I will give an\n\n\n\nillustration of what I mean. It was said of Asinius\nPollio, who had equal gifts for being grave or gay,\nthat he was  and of a pleader\nwho was a fluent speaker extempore, that  Of the same kind,\ntoo, was the remark recorded by Marsus as having\nbeen made by Pompey to Cicero when the latter\nexpressed distrust of his party:  Had this last remark\nbeen uttered on a less serious subject and with less\nserious purpose, or had it not been uttered by Pompey\nhimself, we might have counted it among examples\nof humour. I may also add the words used by\nCicero in a letter to Caerellia to explain why he\nendured the supremacy of Caesar so patiently:\n for here again the\nword  has a spice of humour in it.

With regard to the principles to be observed\nin forensic debate, it might seem that I should\ndelay such instructions until I had finished dealing\nwith all the details of continuous speaking, since\nsuch debates come after the set speeches are done.\nBut since the art of debate turns on invention alone,\ndoes not admit of arrangement, has little need for\nthe embellishments of style, and makes no large\ndemand on memory or delivery, I think that it will\nnot be out of place to deal with it here before I\nproceed to the second of the five parts, since it is\n\n\n\nentirely dependent on the first. Other writers have\nomitted to deal with it on the ground perhaps that\nthey thought the subject had been sufficiently covered\nby their precepts on other topics. For debate consists in attack and defence, on which enough has\nalready been said, since whatever is useful in a continuous speech for the purpose of proof must necessarily be of service in this brief and discontinuous\nform of oratory. For we say the same things in\ndebate, though we say them in a different manner,\nsince debate consists of questions and replies, a topic\nwith which we have dealt fairly exhaustively in\nconnexion with the examination of witnesses. But\nsince this work is designed on an ample scale and\nsince no one can be called a perfect orator unless he\nbe an expert debater, we must devote a little special\nattention to this accomplishment as well, which as a\nmatter of fact is not seldom the deciding factor in a\nforensic victory. For just as the continuous speech\nis the predominant weapon in general questions of\nquality (where the inquiry is as to whether an act\nwas right or wrong), and as a rule is adequate to\nclear up questions of definition and almost all those\nin which the facts are ascertained or inferred by\nconjecture from artificial proof, so on the other\nhand those cases, which are the most frequent of all\nand depend on proofs which are either entirely\ninartificial or of a composite character, give rise\nto the most violent debates; in fact I should say\nthat there is no occasion when the advocate has to\ncome to closer grips with his adversary. For all the\nstrongest points of the argument have to be sharply\nimpressed on the memory of the judge, while we\nhave also to make good all the promises we may\n\n\n\nhave made in the course of our speech and to refute\nthe lies of our opponents. There is no point of a\ntrial where the judge's attention is keener. And\neven mediocre speakers have not without some reason\nacquired the reputation of being good advocates\nsimply by their excellence in debate. Some on the\nother hand think they have done their duty to their\nclients by an ostentatious and fatiguing display of\nelaborate declamation and straightway march out of\ncourt attended by an applauding crowd and leave the\ndesperate battle of debate to uneducated performers\nwho often are of but humble origin. As a result\nin private suits you will generally find that different\ncounsel are employed to plead and to prove the case.\nIf the duties of advocacy are to be thus divided, the\nlatter duty must surely be accounted the more\nimportant of the two, and it is a disgrace to oratory\nthat inferior advocates should be regarded as adequate\nto render the greater service to the litigants. In\npublic cases at any rate the actual pleader is cited\nby the usher as well as the other advocates.\nFor debate the chief requisites are a quick and\nnimble understanding and a shrewd and ready judgment. For there is no time to think; the advocate\nmust speak at once and return the blow almost\nbefore it has been dealt by his opponent. Consequently while it is most important for every portion\nof the case that the advocate should not merely have\ngiven a careful study to the whole case, but that he\nshould have it at his fingers' ends, when he comes\nto the debate it is absolutely necessary that he\nshould possess a thorough acquaintance with all the\npersons, instruments and circumstances of time and\nplace involved: otherwise he will often be reduced\n\n\n\nto silence and forced to give a hurried assent to\nthose who prompt him as to what he should say,\nsuggestions which are often perfectly fatuous owing\nto excess of zeal on the part of the prompter. As a\nresult it sometimes happens that we are put to the\nblush by too ready acceptance of the foolish suggestions of another. Moreover, we have to deal with\nothers beside these prompters who speak for our ear\nalone. Somego so far as to turn the debate into an open\nbrawl. For you may sometimes see several persons\nshouting angrily at the judge and telling him that the\narguments thus suggested are contrary to the truth,\nand calling his attention to the fact that some point\nwhich is prejudicial to the case has been deliberately\npassed over in silence. Consequently the skilled\ndebater must be able to control his tendency to\nanger; there is no passion that is a greater enemy\nto reason, while it often leads an advocate right\naway from the point and forces him both to use\ngross and insulting language and to receive it in\nreturn; occasionally it will even excite him to such\nan extent as to attack the judges. Moderation, and\nsometimes even longsuffering, is the better policy,\nfor the statements of our opponents have not merely\nto be refuted: they are often best treated with contempt, made light of or held up to ridicule, methods\nwhich afford unique opportunity for the display of\nwit. This injunction, however, applies only so long\nas the case is conducted with order and decency: if,\non the other hand, our opponents adopt turbulent\nmethods we must put on a bold front and resist\ntheir impudence with courage. For there are some\nadvocates so brazen-faced that they bluster and\nbellow at us, interrupt us in the middle of a sentence\n\n\n\nand try to throw everything into confusion. While,\nthen, it would be wrong to pay them the compliment of imitation, we must none the less repel their\nonslaughts with vigour by crushing their insolence\nand making frequent appeals to the judges or presiding magistrates to insist on the observance of the\nproper order of speaking. The debater's task is\nnot one that suits a meek temper or excessive\nmodesty, and we are apt to be misled because that\nwhich is really weakness is dignified by the name of\nhonesty. But the quality which is the most serviceable in debate is acumen, which while it is not the\nresult of art (for natural gifts cannot be taught),\nmay none the less be improved by art. In this\nconnexion the chief essential is never for a moment\nto lose sight either of the question at issue or the\nend which we have in view. If we bear this in\nmind, we shall never descend to mere brawling\nnor waste the time allotted to the case by indulging\nin abuse, while we shall rejoice if our adversary\ndoes so."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.511"}, "#text": "Those who have given a careful study to the arguments that are likely to be produced by their\nopponents or the replies which may be made by\nthemselves are almost always ready for the fray.\nThere is, however, a further device available which\nconsists in suddenly introducing into the debate arguments which were deliberately concealed in our set\nspeech: it is a procedure which resembles a surprise\nattack or a sally from an ambush.

It is, therefore,\nwise to conceal some of our weapons: for our\nopponents will often press their attack and stake\neverything on some imagined weakness of our own,\nand will give fresh weight to our proofs by the\ninstancy with which they demand us to produce\nthem.

Again\njudgment is more often than not a matter of\n\n\n\ncertainty, while sagacity is a form of reasoning from\ndeep-lying premises, which generally weighs and\ncompares a number of arguments and in itself\ninvolves both invention and judgment. But here\nagain you must not expect me to lay down any\ngeneral rules. For sagacity depends on circumstances\nand will often find its scope in something preceding\nthe pleading of the cause. For instance in the prosecution of Verres Cicero seems to have shown the\nhighest sagacity in preferring to cut down the time\navailable for his speech rather than allow the trial to\nbe postponed to the following year when Quintus\nHortensius was to be consul. And again in the\nactual pleading sagacity holds the first and most\nimportant place. For it is the duty of sagacity to\ndecide what we should say and what we should pass\nby in silence or postpone; whether it is better to\ndeny an act or to defend it, when we should employ\nan exordium and on what lines it should be designed,\nwhether we should make a statement of facts and if\nso, how, whether we should base our plea on law or\nequity and what is the best order to adopt, while it\nmust also decide on all the nuances of style, and\nsettle whether it is expedient to speak harshly,\ngently or even with humility. But I have already\ngiven advice on all these points as far as each\noccasion permitted, and I shall continue to do the\nsame in the subsequent portions of this work. In\nthe meantime, however, I will give a few instances\nto make my meaning clearer, since it is not possible,\nin my opinion, to do so by laying down general rules.\nWe praise Demosthenes for his sagacity because\nwhen he urged a policy of war upon the Athenians\nafter they had met with a series of reverses, he\n\n\n\npointed out that so far their action had been entirely\nirrational. For they might still make amends for their\nnegligence, whereas, if they had made no mistakes,\nthey would have had no ground for hopes of better\nsuccess in the future. Again, since he feared to\ngive offence if he taxed the people with lack of\nenergy in defending the liberties of their country,\nhe preferred to praise their ancestors for their\ncourageous policy. Thus lie gained a ready hearing,\nwith the natural result that the pride which they\nfelt in the heroic past made them repent of their\nown degenerate behaviour. If we turn to Cicero, we\nshall find that one speech alone, the \nwill suffice to provide a number of examples. The\ndifficulty is to know what special exhibition of sagacity to admire most in this speech. His opening\nstatement of the case, by which he discredited the\nmother whose authority pressed so hardly on her\nson? The fact that he preferred to throw the\ncharge of having bribed the jury back upon his\nopponents rather than deny it on account of what he\ncalls the notorious infamy of the verdict? Or his\nrecourse, last of all, to the support of the law in spite\nof the odious nature of the affair, a method by which\nlie would have set the judges against him but for\nthe fact that he had already softened their feelings\ntowards him? Or the skill which lie shows in stating that he has adopted this course in spite of the\nprotests of his client? What again am I to select as\nan outstanding instance of his sagacity in the  The fact that he refrains from proceeding\nto his statement of facts until he has cleared the\nground by disposing of the previous verdicts against\nthe accused? The manner in which he turns the\n\n\n\nodium of the attempted ambush against Clodius,\nalthough as a matter of fact the encounter was a\npure chance? The way in which he at one and the\nsame time praised the actual deed and showed that\nit was forced upon his client? Or the skill with\nwhich he avoided making Milo plead for consideration and undertook the role of suppliant himself?\nIt would be an endless task to quote all the instances\nof his sagacity, how he discredited Cotta, how he\nput forward his own case in defence of Ligarius and\nsaved Cornelius by his bold admission of the facts.\nIt is enough, I think, to say that there is nothing\nnot merely in oratory, but in all the tasks of life\nthat is more important than sagacity and that without it all formal instruction is given in vain, while\nprudence unsupported by learning will accomplish\nmore than learning unsupported by prudence. It is\nsagacity again that teaches us to adapt our speech to\ncircumstances of time and place and to the persons\nwith whom we are concerned. But since this topic\ncovers a wide field and is intimately connected with\neloquence itself, I shall reserve my treatment of it\ntill I come to give instructions on the subject of\nappropriateness in speaking."}], "quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "quote": {"l": ["blest beyond all maidens Priam's child,", "Beneath Troy's lofty bulwarks doomed to die", "Upon the tomb of him that was thy foe."]}}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "cit": {"quote": {"l": ["Sudden her fingers let the shuttle fall", {"@part": "I", "#text": "And all the thread was spilled,"}]}, "bibl": {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Aen."}, "#text": "ix. 474."}}}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "cit": {"quote": {"l": "In his smooth breast the gaping wound"}, "bibl": {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ib."}, "#text": "xi. 40."}}}], "milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "33"}, "pb": {"@id": "p.475"}}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.155"}, {"@id": "p.373"}]}}}}
