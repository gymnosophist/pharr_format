His father was a rhetorician of some note\nwho practised with success at Rome. It is not surprising therefore to find that the young Quintilian\nwas sent to Rome for his education. Among his\nteachers were the famous Remmius\nPalaemon, and the no less distinguished rhetorician\nDomitius Afer. On completing his education he\nseems to have returned to his native land to teach\nrhetoric there, for we next hear of him as being\nbrought to Rome in 68 A.D. by Galba, then governor\nof Hispania Tarraconensis. At Rome he met with\ngreat success as a teacher and was the first rhetorician to set up a genuine public school and to receive\na salary from the State. He continued to teach for\ntwenty years and had among his pupils the younger\nPliny and the two sons of Domitilla, the sister of\nDomitian. He was also a successful pleader in the\ncourts as we gather from more than one passage in\nhis works. Late in life he married and had two\nsons. But both wife and children predeceased him.\n\n\n\nHe died full of honour, the possessor of wide lands\nand consular rank. The date of his death is unknown, but it was before 100 A.D. He left behind\nhim a treatise  (), the\npresent work, and a speech in defence of a certain\nNaevius Arpinianus, who was accused of murdering\nhis wife. These are the only works known to have\nbeen actually published by him, though others of\nhis speeches had been taken down in shorthand and\ncirculated against his will, while an excess of zeal on\nthe part of his pupils resulted in the unauthorised\npublication of two series of lecture notes. The\npresent work alone survives. The declamations\nwhich have come down to us under his name are\nspurious. Of his character the \ngives us the pleasantest impression. Humane,\nkindly and of a deeply affectionate nature, gifted\nwith a robust common sense and sound literary\njudgment, he may well have been the ideal school-master. The fulsome references to Domitian are\nthe only blemishes which mar this otherwise pleasing\nimpression. And even here we must remember his\ngreat debt to the Flavian house and the genuine\ndifficulty for a man in his position of avoiding the\nofficial style in speaking of the emperor."}, {"pb": {"@id": "p.ix"}, "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Institutio Oratoria,"}, "#text": "As a stylist, though he is often difficult owing\nto compression and the epigrammatic turn which he\ngives his phrases, he is never affected or extravagant.\nHe is still under the influence of the sound traditions\n\n\n\nof the Ciceronian age, and his Latin is silver-gilt\nrather than silver. His despite\nthe fact that much of it is highly technical, has still\nmuch that is of interest to-day, even for those who\ncare little for the history of rhetoric. Notably in\nthe first book his precepts as regards education have\nlasting value: they may not be strikingly original,\nbut they are sound, humane and admirably put. In\nthe more technical portions of his work he is unequal;\nthe reader feels that he cares but little about the\nminute pedantries of rhetorical technique, and that\nhe lacks method in his presentation of the varying\nviews held by his predecessors. But once he is free of\nsuch minor details and touches on themes of real\npractical interest, he is a changed man. He is at\ntimes really eloquent, and always vigorous and\nsound, while throughout the whole work he keeps\nthe same high ideal unswervingly before him."}]}, {"@type": "chapter", "head": "Bibliography", "div3": [{"@type": "section", "head": "Editions", "p": ["Ed. princeps, Campano, Rome, 1470.", "Gronov, Leyden, 1665.", "Gibson, Oxford, 1693.", "Obrecht, Strassburg, 1698.", "Burmann, Leyden, 1720.", "Capperonnier, Paris, 1725.", "Gesner, Gttingen, 1738.", "Spalding, Leipzig, 17981816, with supplementary volume of notes by Zumpt, 1829, and another by Bonnell, 1834."]}, {"@type": "section", "head": "Texts", "p": ["Zumpt, Leipzig, 1831.", "Bonnell.
