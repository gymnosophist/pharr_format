And I had not advanced far before I was driven back by a foul\n                    wind to the very place which I had just quitted.  And as the night was stormy, and as I had lodged that night in the villa of\n                    Publius Valerius, my companion and intimate friend, and as I remained all the\n                    next day at his house waiting for a  fair wind, many of the citizens\n                    of the municipality of  came to\n                    me.

You assumed the manly gown, which your soon\n                    made a womanly one: at first a public prostitute, with a regular price for your\n                    wickedness, and that not a low one. But very soon Curio stepped in, who carried\n                    you off from your public trade, and, as if he had bestowed a matron's robe upon\n                    you, settled you in a steady and durable wedlock.

But this man's ignorance is joined to impudence, nor does he know\n                    what an augur ought to know, nor do what a modest man ought to do.  And just recollect the whole of his conduct during\n                    his consulship from that day up to the ides of March. What lictor was ever so\n                    humble, so abject?

For where can\n                    you be safe in peace? What place can there be for you where laws and courts of\n                    justice have sway, both of which you, as far as in you lay, destroyed by the\n                    substitution of kingly power? Was it for this that Lucius Tarquinius was driven\n                    out; that Spurius Cassius, and Spurius Maelius, and Marcus Manlius were slain;\n                    that many years afterwards a king might be established at  by Marcus Antonius though the bare idea\n                    was impiety?

While he was alive he deprived him of all these\n                    things; now that he is dead, he gives them back again.  And in what words?

A bond for ten millions of sesterces was entered into in the women's\n                    apartment (where many things have been sold, and are still being sold), by his\n                    ambassadors, well-meaning men, but timid and inexperienced in business, without\n                    my advice or that of the rest of the hereditary friends of the monarch.

He,\n                    like a wise man, knew that this was always the law, that those men from whom the\n                    things which tyrants had taken away had been taken, might recover them when the\n                    tyrants were slain.

The kings paid due regard to the auspices, which\n                    this man, though consul and augur, has neglected, not only by passing laws in\n                    opposition to the auspices but also by making his colleague (whom he himself had\n                    appointed irregularly, and had falsified the auspices in order to do so) join in\n                    passing them.  Again, what king was ever so\n                    preposterously impudent as to have all the profits and kindnesses, and\n                    privileges of his kingdom on sale? But what immunity is there, what rights of\n                    citizenship, what rewards that this man has not sold to individuals and to\n                    cities and to entire provinces.? We have never heard of anything base or sordid\n                    being imputed to Tarquinius. But at the house of this man gold was constantly\n                    being weighed out in the spinning room, and money was being paid, and in one\n                    single house every soul who had any interest in the business was selling the\n                    whole empire of the Roman people. We have never heard of any executions of Roman\n                    citizens by the orders of Tarquinius; but this man both at Suessa murdered the\n                    man whom he had thrown into prison, and at  massacred about three hundred most gallant men and\n                    most virtuous citizens.  Lastly, Tarquinius\n                    was conducting a war in defense of the Roman people at the very time when he was\n                    expelled. Antonius was leading an army against the Roman people at the time\n                    when, being abandoned by the legions, he cowered at the name of Caesar and at\n                    his army, and neglecting the regular sacrifices, he offered up before daylight\n                    vows which he could never mean to perform; and at this very moment he is\n                    endeavoring to invade a province of the Roman people. The Roman people,\n                    therefore, has already received and is still looking for greater services at the\n                    hand of Decimus Brutus than our ancestors received from Lucius Brutus, the\n                    founder of this race and name which we ought to be so anxious to preserve."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}, "#text": "But, while all slavery is miserable, to be slave to a man who is profligate,\n                    unchaste, effeminate, never, not even while in fear, sober, is surely\n                    intolerable.

For there\n                    can be a war without a tumult, but\n                    there can not be a tumult without a\n                    war.

So that it is the fact, as I have said, that war\n                    can exist without a tumult, but a tumult can not exist without a war.  In truth, as there is no medium between war and\n                    peace, it is quite plain that a tumult, if it be not a sort of war, must be a\n                    sort of peace; and what more absurd can be said or imagined? However, we have\n                    said too much about a word, let us rather look to the facts, O conscript\n                    fathers, the appreciation of which, I know, is at times injured by too much\n                    attention being paid to words."}, {"milestone": {"@n": "5", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "We are unwilling that this should appear to be a war.

Even if it has before now been\n                    advantageous to you, it will not always be so.  Moreover, you used to complain of that former master, who was a man; what do\n                    you think you will do when your master is a beast?

Very honest language; that is, if you mean all\n                    citizens who are virtuous, and useful, and serviceable to the republic; but if\n                    you wish those who are by nature citizens, but by inclination enemies, to be\n                    saved, what difference is there between you and them?

By\n                    his valor, and wisdom, and magnanimity he thought that the republic had been\n                    saved.  What am I to say? Have we received any\n                    other doctrine from our fathers?

Because Lucius Opimius\n                    the consul has made a speech concerning the republic, the senators have thus\n                    decided on that matter, that Opimius the consul shall defend the\n                    republic.

I\n                    wish no citizen to commit such crimes as deserve to be punished with death. You\n                    think that, even if he has committed them, still he ought to be saved. If there\n                    is any thing in our own body which is injurious to the rest of the body, we\n                    allow that to be burned and cut out, in order that a limb may be lost in\n                    preference to the whole body. And so in the body of the republic, whatever is\n                    rotten must be cut off in order that the whole may be saved.  Harsh language! This is much more harsh, Let the\n                    worthless, and wicked, and impious be saved; let the innocent, the honorable,\n                    the virtuous, the whole republic be destroyed. In the case of one\n                    individual, O Quintus Fufius, I confess that you saw more than I did. I thought\n                    Publius Clodius a mischievous, wicked, lustful, impious, audacious, criminal\n                    citizen. You, on the other hand, called him religious, temperate, innocent,\n                    modest; a citizen to be preserved and desired. In this one particular I admit\n                    that you had great discernment, and that I made a great mistake. For as for your\n                    saying that I am in the habit of arguing against you with ill temper, that is\n                    not the case. I confess that I argue with vehemence, but not with ill temper. I\n                    am not in the habit of getting angry with my friends every now and then, not\n                    even if they deserve it.  Therefore, I can\n                    differ from you without using any insulting language, though not without feeling\n                    the greatest grief of mind. For is the dissension between you and me a trifling\n                    one, or on a trifling subject? Is it merely a case of my favoring this man, and\n                    you that man? Yes; I indeed favor Decimus Brutus, you favor Marcus Antonius; I\n                    wish a colony of the Roman people to be preserved, you are anxious that it\n                    should be stormed and destroyed."}, {"milestone": {"@n": "18", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Can you deny this, when you interpose every sort of delay calculated to weaken\n                    Brutus, and to improve the position of Antonius?

There was no one then who envied him, because he was a new man;\n                    there was no one who did not honor his virtue.

For Servius was wonderfully attached to the moderation of our\n                    forefathers, and was accustomed to reprove the insolence of this age. As if,\n                    therefore, I were able to consult himself as to what he would wish, so I give my\n                    vote for a pedestrian statue of brass, as if I were speaking by his authority\n                    and inclination; which by the honor of the memorial will diminish and mitigate\n                    the great grief and regret of his fellow-citizens.

For if the death of an ambassador happening without\n                    bloodshed and violence requires no honor, why does he vote for the honor of a\n                    public funeral, which is the greatest honor that can be paid to a dead man?

Our ancestors, indeed, decreed statues to many men; public sepulchers to\n                    few. But statues perish by weather, by violence, by lapse of time; but the\n                    sanctity of the sepulchers is in the soil itself, which can neither be moved nor\n                    destroyed by any violence; and while other things are extinguished, so\n                    sepulchers become holier by age."}, {"milestone": {"@n": "7", "@unit": "chapter"}, "#text": "Let, then, that man be distinguished by that honor also, a man to whom no honor\n                    can be given which is not deserved.

But if\n                    Brutus has finished that business, and perceives that he can better serve the\n                    republic by pursuing Dolabella than by remaining in , he will act of his own head, as he has hitherto done;\n                    nor amid such a general conflagration will he wait for the orders of the senate\n                    when instant help is required.

But that can not be done on the present occasion. For in\n                    consequence of the letters of Caius Pansa and Aulus Hirtius, the consuls, and of\n                    Caius Caesar, propraetor, we have all voted that honors be paid to the immortal\n                    gods.

Decreed, do I say? It has never even been\n                    asked for in the letters of the conqueror. \n                    Sulla as consul carried on a civil war; he led his legions into the city and\n                    expelled whomsoever he chose; he slew those whom he had in his power: there was\n                    no mention made of any supplication.

Sulla as  revenged the victory of Cinna, still no\n                    supplication was decreed by the senate. I ask you yourself, O Publius Servilius,\n                    did your colleague send you any letters concerning that most lamentable battle\n                    of Pharsalia? Did he wish you to make any motion about a supplication? Certainly\n                    not. But he did afterward when he took ; when he defeated Pharnaces; but for the battle of\n                    Pharsalia he did not even celebrate a triumph. For that battle had destroyed\n                    those citizens whose, I will not say lives, but even whose victory might have\n                    been quite compatible with the safety and prosperity of the state.  And the same thing had happened in the previous\n                    civil wars. For though a supplication was decreed in my honor when I was consul,\n                    though no arms had been had recourse to at all, still that was voted by a new\n                    and wholly unprecedented kind of decree, not for the slaughter of enemies, but\n                    for the preservation of the citizens. Wherefore, a supplication on account of\n                    the affairs of the republic having been successfully conducted must, O conscript\n                    fathers, be refused by you even though your generals demand it; a stigma which\n                    has never been affixed on any one except Gabinius; or else, by the mere fact of\n                    decreeing a supplication, it is quite inevitable that you must pronounce those\n                    men, for whose defeat you do decree it, enemies of the state."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "25", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "26", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "10", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "section"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "imperator"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "imperator"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "imperator"}], "#text": "What then Servilius did in effect, I do in express terms, when I style those men\n                    imperators.
