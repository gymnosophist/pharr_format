                "0":"\n That which was above all things to be desired, O judges, and which above all things\n was calculated to have the greatest influence towards allaying the unpopularity of\n your order, and putting an end to the discredit into which your judicial decisions\n have fallen, appears to have been thrown in your way, and given to you not by any\n human contrivance, but almost by the interposition of the gods, at a most important\n crisis of the republic. For an opinion has now become established, pernicious to us,\n and pernicious to the republic, which has been the common talk of every one, not\n only at Rome , but among foreign nations\n also,—that in the courts of law as they exist at present, no wealthy man, however\n guilty he may be, can possibly be convicted. \n ",
                "1":"\n Now at this time of peril to your order and to your tribunals, when men are ready\n to attempt by harangues, and by the proposal of new laws, to increase the existing\n unpopularity of the senate, Caius Verres is brought to trial as a criminal, a man\n condemned in the opinion of every one by his life and actions, but acquitted by the\n enormousness of his wealth according to his own hope and boast. I, O judges, have\n undertaken this cause as prosecutor with the greatest good wishes and expectation on\n the part of the Roman people, not in order to increase the unpopularity of the\n senate, but to relieve it from the discredit which I share with it. For I have\n brought before you a man, by acting justly in whose case you have an opportunity of\n retrieving the lost credit of your judicial proceedings, of regaining your credit\n with the Roman people, and of giving satisfaction to foreign nations; a man, the\n embezzler of the public funds, the petty tyrant of Asia and Pamphylia , the\n robber who deprived the city of its rights, the disgrace and ruin of the province of\n Sicily . \n ",
                "2":"\n And if you come to a decision about this man with severity and a due regard to\n your oaths, that authority which ought to remain in you will cling to you still; but\n if that man's vast riches shall break down the sanctity and honesty of the courts of\n justice, at least I shall achieve this, that it shall be plain that it was rather\n honest judgment that was wanting to the republic, than a criminal to the judges, or\n an accuser to the criminal. I, indeed, that I may confess to you the truth about myself, O judges, though\n many snares were laid for me by Caius Verres, both by land and sea, which I partly\n avoided by my own vigilance, and partly warded off by the zeal and kindness of my\n friends, yet I never seemed to be incurring so much danger, and I never was in such\n a state of great apprehension, as I am now in this very court of law. \n ",
                "3":"\n Nor does the expectation which people have formed of my conduct of this\n prosecution, nor this concourse of so vast a multitude as is here assembled,\n influence me (though indeed I am greatly agitated by these circumstances) so much as\n his nefarious plots which he is endeavouring to lay at one and the same time against\n me, against you, against Marcus Gabrio the praetor, and against the allies, against\n foreign nations, against the senate, and even against the very name of senator;\n whose favourite saying it is that they have got to fear who have stolen only as much\n as is enough for themselves, but that he has stolen so much that it may easily be\n plenty for many; that nothing is so holy that it cannot be corrupted, or so strongly\n fortified that it cannot be stormed by money. \n ",
                "4":"\n But if he were as secret in acting as he is audacious in attempting, perhaps in\n some particular he might some time or other have escaped our notice. But it happens\n very fortunately that to his incredible audacity there is joined a most unexampled\n folly. For as he was unconcealed in committing his robberies of money, so in his\n hope of corrupting the judges he has made his intentions and endeavours visible to\n every one. He says that once only in his life has he felt fear: at the time when he\n was first impeached as a criminal by me; because he was only lately arrived from his\n province, and was branded with unpopularity and infamy, not modern but ancient and\n of long standing; and, besides that, the time was unlucky, being very ill-suited for\n corrupting the judges. \n ",
                "5":"\n Therefore, when I had demanded a very short time to prosecute my inquiries in\n Sicily , he found a man to ask for two\n days less to make investigations in Achaia ;\n \n not with any real intention of doing the same with his diligence and industry, that\n I have accomplished by my labour, and daily and nightly investigations. For the\n Achaean inquisitor never even arrived at Brundusium . I in fifty days so traveled over the whole of Sicily that I examined into the records and injuries\n of all the tribes and of all private individuals, so that it was easily visible to\n every one, that he had been seeking out a man not really for the purpose of bringing\n the defendant whom he accused to trial, but merely to occupy the time which ought to\n belong to me. \n ",
                "6":"\n Now that most audacious and most senseless man thinks this. He is aware that I am\n come into court so thoroughly prepared and armed, that I shall fix all his thefts\n and crimes not only in your ears, but in the very eyes of all men. He sees that many\n senators are witnesses of his audacity, he sees that many Roman knights are so too,\n and many citizens, and many of the allies besides to whom he has done unmistakable\n injuries. He sees also that very numerous and very important deputations have come\n here at the same time from most friendly cities, armed with the public authority and\n evidence collected by their states. \n ",
                "7":"\n And though this is the case, still he thinks so ill of all virtuous men, to such an\n extent does he believe the decisions of the senators to be corrupt and profligate,\n that he makes a custom of openly boasting that it was not without reason that he was\n greedy of money, since he now finds that there is such protection in money, and that\n he has bought (what was the hardest thing of all) the very time of his trial, in\n order to be able to buy everything else more easily; so that, as he could not by any\n possibility shirk the force of the accusations altogether, he might avoid the most\n violent gusts of the storm. \n ",
                "8":"\n But if he had placed any hope at all, not only in his cause, but in any honourable\n defence, or in the eloquence or in the influence of any one, he would not be so\n eager in collecting and catching at all these things; he would not scorn and despise\n the senatorial body to such a degree, as to procure a man to be selected out of the\n senate at his will to be made a criminal of, who should plead his cause \n before him, while he in the meantime was preparing whatever he had need of. \n ",
                "9":"\n And what the circumstances are on which he founds his hopes, and what hopes he\n builds on them, and what he is fixing his mind on. I see clearly. But how he can\n have the confidence to think that he can effect anything with the present praetor,\n and the present bench of Judges, I cannot conceive. This one thing I know, which the\n Roman people perceived too when he rejected the judges, that his hopes were of that nature that he placed\n all his expectations of safety in his money; and that if this protection were taken\n from him, he thought nothing would be any help to him. In truth, what genius is there so\n powerful, what faculty of speaking, what eloquence so mighty, as to be in any\n particular able to defend the life of that man, convicted as it is of so many vices\n and crimes, and long since condemned by the inclinations and private sentiments of\n every one? \n ",
                "10":"\n And, to say nothing of the stains and disgraces of his youth, what other remarkable\n event is there in his quaestorship, that first step to honour, except that Cnaeus\n Carbo was robbed by his quaestor of the public money? that the consul was plundered\n and betrayed? his army deserted? his province abandoned? the holy nature and\n obligations imposed on him by lot violated?—whose lieutenancy was the ruin of all Asia and Pamphylia , in which provinces he plundered many houses, very many\n cities, all the shrines and temples; when he renewed and repeated against Cnaeus\n Dolabella his ancient wicked tricks when he had been quaestor, and did not only in\n his danger desert, but even attack and betray the man to whom he had been\n lieutenant, and proquaestor, and whom he had brought into odium by his crimes; \n ",
                "11":"\n —whose only praetorship was the destruction of the sacred temples and the public\n works, and, as to his legal decisions, was the adjudging and awarding of property\n contrary to all established rules and precedents. But now he has established great\n and numerous monuments and proofs of all his vices in the province of Sicily , which he for three years so harassed and\n ruined that it can by no possibility be restored to its former condition, and\n appears scarcely able to be at all recovered after a long series of years, and a\n long succession of virtuous praetors. \n ",
                "12":"\n While this man was praetor the Sicilians enjoyed neither their own laws, nor the\n degrees of our senate, nor the common rights of every nation. Every one in\n Sicily has only so much left as either\n escaped the notice or was disregarded by the satiety of that most avaricious and\n licentious man. No legal\n decision for three years was given on any other ground but his will; no property was\n so secure to any man, even if it had descended to him from his father and\n grandfather, but he was deprived of it at his command; enormous sums of money were\n exacted from the property of the cultivators of the soil by a new and nefarious\n system. The most faithful of the allies were classed in the number of enemies. Roman\n citizens were tortured and put to death like slaves; the greatest criminals were\n acquitted in the courts of justice through bribery; the most upright and honourable\n men, being prosecuted while absent, were condemned and banished without being heard\n in their own defence; the most fortified harbours, the greatest and strongest\n cities, were laid open to pirates and robbers; the sailors and soldiers of the Sicilians,\n our own allies and friends, died of hunger; the best built fleets on the most\n important stations were lost and destroyed, to the great disgrace of the Roman\n people. \n ",
                "13":"\n This same man while praetor plundered and stripped those most ancient monuments,\n some erected by wealthy monarchs and intended by them as ornaments for their cities;\n some, too, the work of our own generals, which they either gave or restored as\n conquerors to the different states in Sicily . And he did this not only in the case of public statues and\n ornaments, but he also plundered all the temples consecrated in the deepest\n religious feelings of the people. He did not leave, in short, one god to the\n Sicilians which appeared to him to be made in a tolerably workmanlike manner, and\n with any of the skill of the ancients. I am prevented by actual shame from speaking\n of his nefarious licentiousness as shown in rapes and other such enormities; and I\n am unwilling also to increase the distress of those men who have been unable to\n preserve their children and their wives unpolluted by his wanton lust. \n ",
                "14":"\n But, you will say, these things were done by him in such a manner as not to be\n notorious to all men. I think there is no man who has heard his name who cannot also\n relate wicked actions of his; so that I ought rather to be afraid of being thought\n to omit many of his crimes, than to invent any charges against him. And indeed I do\n not think that this multitude which has collected to listen to me wishes so much to\n learn of me what the facts of the case are, as to go over it with me, refreshing its\n recollection of what it knows already. And as this is the case, that senseless and profligate man attempts\n to combat me in another manner. He does not seek to oppose the eloquence of any one\n also to me, he does not rely on the popularity, or influence, or authority of any\n one. He pretends that he trusts to these things; but I see what he is really aiming\n at; (and indeed he is not acting with any concealment.) He sets before me empty\n titles of nobility, that is to say the names of arrogant men, who do not hinder me\n so much by being noble, as assist me by being notorious,—he pretends to rely on\n their protection; when he has in reality been contriving something else this long\n time. \n ",
                "15":"\n What hope he now has, and what he is endeavouring to do, I will now briefly explain\n to you, O judges. But first of all, remark, I beg you, how the matter has been\n arranged by him from the beginning. When he first returned from the province, he\n endeavoured to get rid of this prosecution by corrupting the judges at a great\n expense; and this object he continued to keep in view till the conclusion of the\n appointment of the judges. After the judges were appointed—because in drawing lots\n for them the fortune of the Roman people had defeated his hopes, and because in\n rejecting some, my diligence had defeated his impudence—the whole attempt at bribery\n was abandoned. \n ",
                "16":"\n The affair was going on admirably; lists of your names and of the whole tribunal\n were in every one's hands. It did not seem possible to mark the votes \n of these men with any distinguishing mark or colour or spot of dirt; and that\n fellow, from having been brisk and in high spirits, became on a sudden so downcast\n and humbled, that he seemed to be condemned not only by the Roman people but even by\n himself. But lo! all of a sudden, within these few days, since the consular comitia\n have taken place, he has gone back to his original plan with more\n money, and the same plots are now laid against your reputation and against the\n fortunes of every one, by the instrumentality of the same people; which fact at\n first, O judges, was pointed out to me by a very slight hint and indication; but\n afterwards, when my suspicions were once aroused, I arrived at the knowledge of all\n the most secret counsels of that party without any mistake. \n ",
                "17":"\n For as Hortensius the consul elect was being attended home again from the Campus by\n a great concourse and multitude of people, Caius Curio fell in with that multitude\n by chance,—a man whom I wish to name by way of honour rather than of disparagement.\n I will tell you what, if he had been unwilling to have it mentioned, he would not\n have spoken of in so large an assembly so openly and undisguisedly; which, however,\n shall be mentioned by me deliberately and cautiously, that it may be seen that I pay\n due regard to our friendship and to his dignity. \n ",
                "18":"\n He sees Verres in the crowd by the arch of Fabius; he speaks to the man, and with a loud voice congratulates him\n on his victory. He does not say a word to Hortensius himself, who had been made\n consul, or to his friends and relations who were present attending on him; but he\n stops to speak to this man, embraces him, and bids him cast off all anxiety. “I give\n you notice,” said he, “that you have been acquitted by this day's comitia.” And as\n many most honourable men heard this, it is immediately reported to me; indeed, every\n one who saw me mentioned it to me the first thing. To some it appeared scandalous,\n to others ridiculous; ridiculous to those who thought that this cause depended on\n the credibility of the witnesses, on the importance of the charges, and on the power\n of the judges, and not on the consular comitia; scandalous to those who looked\n deeper, and who thought that this congratulation had reference to the corruption of\n the judge. \n ",
                "19":"\n In truth, they argued in this manner—the most honourable men spoke to one another\n and to me in this manner—that there were now manifestly and undeniably no courts of\n justice at all. The very criminal who the day before thought that he was already\n condemned, is acquitted now that his defender has been made consul. What are we to\n think then? Will it avail nothing that all Sicily , all the Sicilians, that all the merchants who have business\n in that country, that all public and private documents are now at Rome ? Nothing, if the consul elect wills it\n otherwise. What! will not the judges be influenced by the accusation, by the\n evidence, by the universal opinion of the Roman people? No. Everything will be\n governed by the power and authority of one man. I will speak the truth, O judges. This thing agitated\n me greatly; for every good man was speaking in this way—“That fellow will be taken\n out of your hands; but we shall not preserve our judicial authority much longer; for\n who, when Verres is acquitted, will be able to make any objection to transferring it\n from us?” \n ",
                "20":"\n It was a grievous thing to every one, and the sudden elation of that profligate man\n did not weigh with them as much as that fresh congratulation of a very honourable\n one. I wished to dissemble my own vexation at it; I wished to conceal my own grief\n of mind under a cheerful countenance, and to bury it in silence. But lo! on the very\n days when the praetors elected were dividing their duties by lot, and when it fell\n to the share of Marcus Metellus to hold trials concerning extortion, information is\n given me that that fellow was receiving such congratulations, that he also sent men\n home to announce it to his wife. \n ",
                "21":"\n And this too in truth displeased me; and yet I was not quite aware what I had so\n much to fear from this allotment of the praetor's duties. But I ascertained this one\n thing from trustworthy men from whom I received all my intelligence; that many\n chests full of Sicilian money had been sent by some senator to a Roman knight, and\n that of these about ten chests had been left at that senator's house, with the\n statement that they were left to be used in the comitia when I expected to be\n elected aedile, and that men to distribute this money among all the tribes had been\n summoned to attend him by night. \n ",
                "22":"\n Of whom one, who thought himself under the greatest obligations to me, came to me\n that same night; reports to me the speech which that fellow had addressed to them;\n that he had reminded them how liberally he had treated them formerly when he was\n candidate for the praetorship, and at the last consular and praetorian comitia; and\n in the second place that he had promised them immediately whatever money they\n required, if they could procure my rejection from the aedileship. That on this some\n of them said that they did not dare attempt it; that others answered that they did\n not think it could be managed; but that one bold friend was found, a man of the same\n family as himself, Quintus Verres, of the Romilian tribe, of the most perfect school\n of bribers, the pupil and friend of Verres' father, who promised that, if five\n hundred thousand sesterces were provided, he would\n manage it; and that there were some others who said that they would cooperate with\n him. And as this was the case, he warned me beforehand with a friendly disposition,\n to take great care. \n ",
                "23":"\n I was disquieted about many most important matters at one and the same moment, and\n with very little time to deliberate. The comitia were at hand; and at them I was to\n be opposed at immense expenditure of money. This trial was at hand; the Sicilian\n treasurers menaced that matter also. I was afraid, from apprehension about the\n comitia, to conduct the matters relating to the trial with freedom; and because of\n the trial, I was unable to attend with all my heart to my canvass. Threatening the\n agents of bribery was out of the question, because I saw that they were aware that I\n was hampered and fettered by this trial. \n ",
                "24":"\n And at this same moment I hear that notice has been given to the Sicilians by\n Hortensius to come to speak to him at his house; that the Sicilians behaved in that\n matter with a proper sense of their own liberty, and, when they understood on what\n account they were sent for, they would not go. In the meantime my comitia began to\n be held; of which that fellow thought himself the master, as he had been of all the\n other comitia this year. He began to run about, that influential man, with his son,\n a youth of engaging and popular manners, among the tribes. The son began to address\n and to call on all the friends of his father, that is to say, all his agents for\n bribery; and when this was noticed and perceived, the Roman people took care with\n the most earnest goodwill that I should not be deprived of my honour through the\n money of that man, whose riches had not been able to make me violate my good\n faith. \n ",
                "25":"\n After that I was released from that great anxiety about my canvass, I began, with a\n mind much more unoccupied and much more at ease, to think of nothing and to do\n nothing except what related to this trial. I find, O judges, these plans formed and\n begun to be put in execution by them, to protract the matter, whatever steps it\n might be necessary to take in order to do so, so that the cause might be pleaded\n before Marcus Metellus as praetor. That by doing so they would have these\n advantages; firstly, that Marcus Metellus was most friendly to them; secondly, that\n not only would Hortensius be consul, but Quintus Metellus also: and listen while I\n show you how great a friend he is to them. For he gave him a token of his goodwill\n of such a sort, that he seemed to be giving it as a return for the suffrages of the tribes\n which he had scoured to him. \n ",
                "26":"\n Did you think that I would say nothing of such serious matters as these? and that,\n at a crisis of such danger to the republic and my own character, I would consult\n anything rather than my duty and my dignity? The other consul elect sent for the\n Sicilians; some came, because Lucius Metellus was praetor in Sicily . To them he speaks in this manner: that he is\n the consul; that one of his brothers has Sicily for his province; that the other is to be judge in all\n prosecutions for extortion; and that care had been taken in many ways that there\n should be no possibility of Verres being injured. \n ",
                "27":"\n I ask you, Metellus, what is corrupting the course of justice, if this is not,—to\n seek to frighten witnesses, and especially Sicilians, timid and oppressed men, not\n only by your own private influence, but by their fear of the consul, and by the\n power of two praetors? What would you do for an innocent man or for a relation, when\n for the sake of a most guilty man, entirely unconnected with you, you depart from\n your duty and your dignity, and allow what he is constantly saying to appear true to\n any one who is not acquainted with you? \n ",
                "28":"\n For they said that Verres said, that you had not been made consul by destiny, as\n the rest of your family had been, but by his assistance. Two consuls, therefore, and\n the judge are to be such because of his will. We shall not only, says he, avoid\n having a man too scrupulous in investigating, too subservient to the opinion of the\n people, Marcus Glabrio, but we shall have this advantage also:—Marcus Caesonius is\n the judge, the colleague of our accuser a man of tried and proved experience in the\n decision of actions. It will never do for us to have such a man as that on the\n bench, which we are endeavouring to corrupt by some means or other; for before, when\n he was one of the Judges on the tribunal of which Junius \n was president, he was not only very indignant at that shameful transaction, but he\n even betrayed and denounced it. After the first of January we shall not have this\n man for our judge,— \n ",
                "29":"\n we shall not have Quintus Manlius and Quintus Cornificius, two most severe and\n upright judges, for judges, because they will then be tribunes of the people.\n Publius Sulpicius, a solemn and upright judge, must enter on his magistracy on the\n fifth of November. Marcus Crepereius, of that renowned equestrian family and of that\n incorruptible character; Lucius Cassius, of a family renowned for its severity in\n all things, and especially as judges; Cnaeus Tremellius, a man of the greatest\n scrupulousness and diligence;—these three men of ancient strictness of principle are\n all military tribunes elect. After the first of January they will not be able to act\n as judges. And besides this, we elect by lot a successor in the room of Marcus\n Metellus, since he is to preside over this very trial. And so after the first of\n January, the praetor, and almost the whole bench of judges being changed, we shall\n elude the terrible threats of the prosecutor, and the great expectations entertained\n of this trial, and manage it according to our own will and pleasure. \n ",
                "30":"\n Today is the fifth of August. You began to assemble at the ninth hour. This day\n they do not even count. There are ten days between this and the votive games which\n Cnaeus Pompeius is going to celebrate. These games will take up fifteen days; then\n immediately the Roman games will follow. And so, when nearly forty days have\n intervened, then at length they think they shall have to answer what has been said\n by us; and they think that, what with speeches, and what with excuses, they will\n easily be able to protract the cause till the period of the games of Victory. With\n these the plebeian games are connected, after which there will be either no day at\n all, or very few for pleading in. And so, when the accusation has got stale and\n cold, the matter will come all fresh before Marcus Metellus as praetor. And if I had\n distrusted his good faith, I should not have retained him as a judge. \n ",
                "31":"\n But now I have such an opinion of him, that I would rather this matter was brought\n to a close while he is judge than while he is praetor; and I would rather entrust to\n him his own tablet while he is on his oath, than the tablets of others when he is\n restrained by no such obligation. Now, O judges, I consult you as to what you think I ought to do. For\n you will, in truth, without speaking, give me that advice which I understand that I\n must inevitably adopt. If I occupy the time which I legitimately might in speaking,\n I shall reap the fruit of my labour, industry, and diligence; and by this\n prosecution I shall make it manifest that no one in the memory of man appears ever\n to have come before a court of justice better prepared, more vigilant, or with his\n cause better got up. But while I am getting this credit for my industry, there is\n great danger lest the criminal may escape. What, then, is there which can be done? I\n think it is neither obscure nor hidden. \n ",
                "32":"\n I will reserve for another time that fruit of praise which may be derived from a\n long uninterrupted speech. At present I must support this accusation by documentary\n evidence, by witnesses, by letters of private individuals and of public bodies, and\n by various other kinds of proof. The whole of this contest is between you and me, O\n Hortensius. I will speak openly. If I thought that you were contending with me in\n the matter of speaking, and of getting rid of the charges I bring against your\n client in this cause, I, too, would devote much pains to mounting an elaborate\n accusation, and to dilating on my charges. Now, since you have determined to contend\n against me with artifice, not so much in obedience to the promptings of your own\n nature, as from consulting his occasions and his cause, it is necessary for me to\n oppose conduct of that sort with prudence. \n ",
                "33":"\n Your plan is, to begin to answer me after two sets of games have been celebrated;\n mine is to have the adjournment over before the first series. And the result will be,\n that that plan of yours will be thought crafty, but this determination of mine\n necessary. But as for\n what I had begun to say,—namely, that the contest is between you and me, this is\n it,—I, when I had undertaken this cause at the request of the Sicilians, and had\n thought it a very honourable and glorious thing for me that they were willing to\n make experiment of my integrity and diligence, who already knew by experience my\n innocence and temperance: then, when I had undertaken this business, I proposed to\n myself some greater action also by which the Roman people should be able to see my\n goodwill towards the republic. \n ",
                "34":"\n For that seemed to me to be by no means worthy of my industry and efforts, for that\n man to be brought to trial by me who had been already condemned by the judgment of\n all men, unless that intolerable influence of yours, and that grasping nature which\n you have displayed for some years in many trials, was interposed also in the case of\n that desperate man. But no, since all this dominion and sovereignty of yours over\n the courts of justice delights you so much, and since there are some men who are\n neither ashamed of their licentiousness and their infamy, nor weary of it, and who,\n as if on purpose, seem to wish to encounter hatred and unpopularity from the Roman\n people, I profess that I have undertaken this,—a great burden perhaps, and one\n dangerous to myself, but still worthy of my applying myself to it with all the\n vigour of my age, and all diligence. \n ",
                "35":"\n And since the whole order of the senate is weighed down by the discredit brought on\n it by the wickedness and audacity of a few, and is overwhelmed by the infamy of the\n tribunals, I profess myself an enemy to this race of men, an accuser worthy of their\n hatred, a persevering, a bitter adversary. I arrogate this to myself, I claim this\n for myself, and I will carry out this enmity in my magistracy, and from that post in\n which the Roman people has willed that from the next first of January I shall act in\n concert with it in matters concerning the republic, and concerning wicked men. I\n promise the Roman people that this shall be the most honourable and the fairest\n employment of my aedileship. I warn, I forewarn, I give notice beforehand to those\n men who are wont either to put money down, to undertake for others, to receive\n money, or to promise money, or to act as agents in bribery, or as go-betweens in\n corrupting the seat of judgment, and who have promised their influence or their\n impudence in aid of such a business, in this trial to keep their hands and\n inclinations from this nefarious wickedness. \n ",
                "36":"\n Hortensius will then be consul with the chief command and authority, but I shall be\n aedile—that is, I shall be a little more than a private individual; and yet this\n business, which I promise that I am going to advocate, is of such a nature, so\n pleasing and agreeable to the Roman people, that the consul himself will appear in\n this cause, if that be possible, even less than a private individual in comparison\n of me. All those things shall not only be mentioned, but even, where certain matters\n have been explained, shall be fully discussed, which for the last ten years, ever\n since the office of the judge has been transferred to the senate, has been\n nefariously and wickedly done in the decision of judicial matters. \n ",
                "37":"\n The Roman people shall know from me why it is that when the equestrian body\n supplied the judges for nearly fifty years together, not even the slightest\n suspicion ever arose of bribes having been accepted for the purpose of influencing a\n decision; why it is, I say, when the judicial authority was transferred to the\n senatorial body, and the power of the Roman\n people over every one of us was taken away, Quintus Calidius, when he was condemned,\n said that a man of praetorian rank could not honestly be condemned at a less price\n than three hundred thousand sesterces ; why it is\n that when Publius Septimius, a senator, was condemned for extortion, when Quintus\n Hortensius was praetor, damages were assessed against him, including money which he\n had received as judge to decide causes which came before him; \n ",
                "38":"\n why it is, that in the case of Caius Herennius, and in that of Caius Popillius,\n senators, both of whom were convicted of peculation—why it is, that in the case of\n Marcus Atilius, who was convicted of treason—this was made plain,—that they had all\n received money for the purpose of influencing their judicial decisions; why it is,\n that senators have been found who, when Caius Verres, as praetor of the city, gave\n out the lots, voted against the criminal whom they were condemning without having\n inquired into his case; why it is, that a senator was found who, when he was judge,\n took money in one and the same trial both from the defendant to distribute among the\n judges, and from the accuser to condemn the defendant. \n ",
                "39":"\n But how shall I adequately complain of that stain, that disgrace, that calamity of\n the whole senatorial order,—that this thing actually happened in the city while the\n senatorial order furnished the judges, that the votes of men on their oaths were\n marked by coloured tablets? I pledge myself that I will urge all these things with\n diligence and with strictness. And what do you suppose will be my thoughts, if I find in this very\n trial any violation of the laws committed in any similar manner? especially when I\n can prove by many witnesses that Caius Verres often said in Sicily , in the hearing of many persons, “that he had\n a powerful friend, in confidence in whom he was plundering the province; and that he\n was not seeking money for himself alone, but that he had so distributed the three\n years of his Sicilian praetorship, that he should say he did exceedingly well, if he\n appropriated the gains of one year to the augmentation of his own property, those of\n the second year to his patrons and defenders, and reserved the whole of the third\n year, the most productive and gainful of all, for the judges.” \n ",
                "40":"\n From which it came into my mind to say that which, when I had said lately before\n Marcus Glabrio at the time of striking the list of judges, I perceived the Roman\n people greatly moved by; that I thought that foreign nations would send ambassadors\n to the Roman people to procure the abrogation of the law, and of all trials, about\n extortion; for if there were no trials, they think that each man would only plunder\n them of as much as he would think sufficient for himself and his children; but now,\n because there are trials of that sort, every one carries off as much as it will take\n to satisfy himself, his patrons, his advocates, the praetor, and the judges; and\n that this is an enormous sum; that they may be able to satisfy the cupidity of one\n most avaricious man, but are quite unable to incur the expense of his most guilty\n victory over the laws. \n ",
                "41":"\n O trials worthy of being recorded! O splendid reputation of our order! when the\n allies of the Roman people are unwilling that trials for extortion should take\n place, which were instituted by our ancestors for the sake of the allies. Would that\n man ever have had a favourable hope of his own safety, if he had not conceived in\n his mind a bad opinion of you? on which account, he ought, if possible, to be still\n more hated by you than he is by the Roman people, because he considers you like\n himself in avarice and wickedness and perjury. \n ",
                "42":"\n And I beg you, in the name of the immortal gods, O judges, think of and guard\n against this; I warn you, I give notice to you, of what I am well assured, that this\n most seasonable opportunity has been given to you by the favour of the gods, for the\n purpose of delivering your whole order from hatred, from unpopularity, from infamy,\n and from disgrace. There is no severity believed to exist ill the tribunals, nor any\n scruples with regard to religion; in short, there are not believed to be any\n tribunals at all. Therefore we are despised and scorned by the Roman people; we are\n branded with a heavy and now a long standing infamy. \n ",
                "43":"\n Nor, in fact, is there any other reason for which the Roman people has with so much\n earnestness sought the restoration of the tribunician power: but when it was\n demanding that in words, it seemed to be asking for that, but in reality it was\n asking for tribunes which it could trust. And this did not escape the notice of\n Quintus Catulus, a most sagacious and honourable man, who, when Cnaeus Pompeius, a\n most gallant and illustrious man, made a motion about the tribunitian power, and\n when he was asked his opinion, begin his speech in this manner, speaking with the\n greatest authority, “that the conscript fathers presided over the courts of justice\n badly and wickedly; but if in deciding judicial trials they had been willing to\n satisfy the expectations of the Roman people, men would not so greatly regret the\n tribunitian power?” \n ",
                "44":"\n Lastly, when Cnaeus Pompeius himself, when first he delivered an address to the\n people as consul elect, mentioned (what seemed above all things to be watched for)\n that he would restore the power of the tribunes, a great shout was raised at his\n words, and a grateful murmur pervaded the assembly. And when he had said also in the\n same assembly “that the provinces were depopulated and tyrannised over, that the\n courts of justice were become base and wicked, and that he desired to provide for\n and to remedy that evil,” the Roman people then signified their good will, not with\n a shout, but with a universal uproar. \n ",
                "45":"\n But now men are on the watch towers; they observe how every one of you behaves\n himself in respecting religion and in preserving the laws. They see that, ever since\n the passing of the law for restoring the power of the tribunes, only one senator,\n and he too a very insignificant one, has been condemned. And though they do nor blame this, yet they\n have nothing which they can very much commend. For there is no credit in being\n upright in a case where there is no one who is either able or who endeavours to\n corrupt one. \n ",
                "46":"\n This is a trial in which you will be deciding about the defendant, the Roman people\n about you;—by the example of what happens to this man it will be determined whether,\n when senators are the judges, a very guilty and a very rich man can be condemned.\n Moreover, he is a criminal of such a sort, that there is absolutely nothing whatever\n in him except the greatest crimes, and excessive riches; so that if he be acquitted,\n no other opinion can be formed of the matter except that which is the most\n discreditable possible. Such numerous and enormous vices as his will not be\n considered to have been canceled by influence, by family connection, by some things\n which may have been done well, or even by the minor vices of flattery and\n subservience. \n ",
                "47":"\n In short, I will conduct the cause in this manner; I will bring forward things of\n such a sort, so well known, so proved by evidence, so important, and so undeniable,\n that no one shall venture to use his influence to obtain from you the acquittal of\n that man; for I have a sure path and method by which I can investigate and become\n acquainted with all their endeavours. The matter will be so managed by me that not\n only the ears but even the eyes of the Roman people shall seem to be present at all\n their counsels. \n ",
                "48":"\n You have in your power to remove and to eradicate the disgrace and infamy which has\n now for many years attached to your order. It is evident to all men, that since\n these tribunals have been established which we now have, there has never been a\n bench of judges of the same splendour and dignity as this. If anything is done wrongly in this case, all\n men will think not that other more capable judges should be appointed of the same\n order of men, which is not possible; but that another order must be sought for, from\n which to select the judges for the future. \n ",

Do you undertake the\n cause of the tribunals. Do you undertake the cause of impartiality, of integrity, of\n good faith and of religion. Do you undertake the cause of the senate; that, being\n proved worthy by its conduct in this trial, it may come into favour and popularity\n with the Roman people. Think who you are, and in what a situation you are placed;\n what you ought to give to the Roman people, what you ought to repay to your\n ancestors. Let the recollection of the Acilian law passed by your father occur to\n your mind, owing to which law the Roman people has had this advantage of most\n admirable decisions and very strict judges in cases of extortion. \n ",

The reward of the credit\n gained by your decision, or the danger arising from the unpopularity which will\n accrue to you if you decide unjustly, I think ought to belong to you; the labour and\n anxiety to me; the knowledge of what is done and the recollection of what has been\n said by every one, to all. \n ",
                "54":"\n I will adopt this course, not an unprecedented one, but one that has been adopted\n before, by those who are now the chief men of our state,—the course, I mean, of at\n once producing the witnesses. What you will find novel, O judges, is this, that I\n will so marshal my witnesses as to unfold the whole of my accusation; that when I\n have established it by examining my witnesses, by arguments, and by my speech, then\n I shall show the agreement of the evidence with my accusation: so that there shall\n be no difference between the established mode of prosecuting, and this new one,\n except that, according to the established mode, when everything has been said which\n is to be said, then the witnesses are produced; here they shall be produced as each\n count is brought forward; so that the other side shall have the same opportunity of\n examining them, of arguing and making speeches or their evidence. If there be any\n one who prefers an uninterrupted speech and the old mode of conducting a prosecution\n without any break, he shall have it in some other trial. But for this time let him\n understand that what we do is done by us on compulsion, (for we only do it with the\n design of opposing the artifice of the opposite party by our prudence.) \n ",

We will\n make this so plain to you by witnesses, by private documents, and by public records\n that you shall decide that, even if we had abundant space and leisure days for\n making a long speech without any inconvenience, still there was no need at all of a\n long speech in this matter. \n "

Although that fellow has not in reality any hope, nor the\n Roman people any fear of his acquittal, there are some men who do marvel at his\n singular impudence in being present, in replying to the accusations brought against\n him; but to me even this does not appear marvellous in comparison with his other\n actions of audacity and madness. For he has done many impious and nefarious actions\n both against gods and men; by the punishment for which crimes he is now disquieted\n and driven out of his mind and out of his senses. \n ",

The reverence due to, and the holy\n ceremonies practiced in, every shrine and every temple—but all violated by him; and\n the images of the gods, which have not only been taken away from their temples, but\n which are even lying in darkness, having been cast aside and thrown away by him—do\n not allow his mind to rest free from frenzy and madness. \n ",

When such men\n as these are judges, shall I not be able to prove that Caius Verres has taken bribes\n contrary to the laws?

There will be some men, too, who will blame his\n boldness in having released some of the contractors from supplying the corn due to\n the public, when they could make it for his own interest. There will even, perhaps,\n be some men who will think that robbery of his most especially to be punished, when\n he did not hesitate to carry off out of the most holy temples and out of the cities\n of our allies and friends, the monuments of Marcus Marcellus and of Publius\n Africanus, which in name indeed belonged to them, but in reality both belonged and\n were always considered to belong to the Roman people. \n ",

Let him recollect that, in the former pleadings, being excited by the\n adverse and hostile shouts of the Roman people, he confessed that he had not caused\n the leaders of the pirates to be executed; and that he was afraid even then that it\n would be imputed to him that he had released them for money.

I thought that my good faith and diligence was\n approved of, not only by those to whom I was known, but even by strangers. And I was\n not mistaken: for in the comitia for my election, when that man was employing\n boundless bribery against me, the Roman people decided that his money, which had no\n influence with me when put in opposition to my own good faith, ought to have no\n influence with them to rob me of my honour. On the day when you first, O judges,\n were summoned to this place, and sat in judgment on this criminal, who was so\n hostile to your order, who was so desirous of a new constitution, of a new tribunal\n and new judges, as not to be moved at the sight of you and of your assembled body?\n \n ",
                "19":"\n When on the trial your dignity procured me the fruit of my diligence, I gained\n thus much,—that in the same hour that I began to speak, I cut off from that\n audacious, wealthy, extravagant, and abandoned criminal, all hope of corrupting the\n judges; that on the very first day, when such a number of witnesses had been brought\n forward, the Roman people determined that If he were acquitted, the republic would\n no longer exist; that the second day took away from his friends, not only all hope\n of victory, but even all inclination to make any defence; that the third day\n prostrated the man so entirely, that, pretending to be sick, he took counsel, not\n what reply he could make, but how he could avoid making any; and after that, on the\n subsequent days, he was so oppressed and overwhelmed by these accusations, by these\n witnesses, both from the city and from the provinces, that when these days of the\n games intervened, no one thought that he had procured an adjournment, but they\n thought that he was condemned. \n ",
                "20":"\n So that, as far as I am concerned, O judges, I gained the day; for I did not\n desire the spoils of Caius Verres, but the good opinion of the Roman people. It was\n my business to act as accuser only if I had a good cause. What cause was ever juster\n than the being appointed and selected by as illustrious a province as its defender?\n To consult the welfare of the republic;—what could be more honourable for the\n republic, than while the tribunals were in such general discredit, to bring before\n them a man by whose condemnation the whole order of the senate might be restored to\n credit and favour with the Roman people?—to prove and convince men that it was a\n guilty man who was brought to trial? Who is there of the Roman people who did not\n carry away this conviction from the previous pleading, that if all the wickednesses,\n thefts, and enormities of all who have ever been condemned before were brought\n together into one place, they could scarcely be likened or compared to but a small\n part of this man's crimes? \n ",
                "21":"\n Judges, consider and deliberate what becomes your fame, your reputation, and the\n common safety? Your eminence prevents your being able to make any mistake without\n the greatest injury and danger to the republic. For the Roman people cannot hope\n that there are any other men in the senate who can judge uprightly, if you cannot.\n It is inevitable that, when it has learnt to despair of the whole order, it should\n look for another class of men and another system of judicial proceedings. If this\n seems to you at all a trifling matter, because you think the being judges a grave\n and inconvenient burden, you ought to be aware, in the first place, that it makes a\n difference whether you throw off that burden yourselves, of your own accord, or\n whether the power of sitting as judges is taken away from you because you have been\n unable to convince the Roman people of your good faith and scrupulous honesty. In\n the second place, consider this also, with what great danger we shall come before\n those judges whom the Roman people, by reason of its hatred to you, has willed shall\n judge concerning you. \n ",
                "22":"\n But I will tell you, O judges, what I am sure of. Know, then, that there are some\n men who are possessed with such a hatred or your order, that they now make a\n practice of openly saying that they are willing for that man, whom they know to be a\n most infamous one, to be acquitted for this one reason,—that then the honour or the\n judgment-seat may be taken from the senate with ignominy and disgrace. It is not my\n fear for your good faith, O judges, which has urged me to lay these considerations\n before you at some length, but the new hopes which those men are entertaining; for\n when those hopes had brought Verres suddenly back from the gates of the city to this\n court, some men suspected that his intention had not been changed so suddenly\n without a cause. \n ",
                "23":"\n Now, in order that Hortensius may not be able to employ any new sort of complaint,\n and to say that a defendant is oppressed if the accuser says nothing about him; that\n nothing is so dangerous to the fortunes of an innocent man as for his adversaries to\n keep silence; and in order that he may not praise my abilities in a way which I do\n not like, when he says that, if I had said much, I should have relieved him against\n whom I was speaking, and that I have undone him because I said nothing,—I will\n comply with his wishes, I shall employ one long unbroken speech: not because it is\n necessary, but that I may try whether he will be most vexed at my having been silent\n then or at my speaking now. \n ",
                "24":"\n Here you, perhaps, will take care that I do not remit one hour of the time allowed\n me by law. If I do not employ the whole time which is allowed me by law, you will\n complain; you will invoke the faith of gods and men, calling them to witness how\n Caius Verres is circumvented because the prosecutor will not speak as long as he is\n allowed to speak by the law. What the law gives me for my own sake, may I not be\n allowed to forbear using? For the time for stating the accusation is given me for my\n own sake, that I may be able to unfold my charges and the whole cause in my speech.\n If I do not use it all, I do you no injury, but I give up something of my own right\n and advantage. You injure me, says he, for the cause ought to be thoroughly\n investigated. Certainly, for otherwise a defendant cannot be condemned, however\n guilty he may be. Were you, then, indignant that anything should be done by me to\n make it less easy for him to be condemned? For if the cause be understood, many men\n may be acquitted; if it be not understood, no one can be condemned. \n ",
                "25":"\n I injure him, it seems, for I take away the right of adjournment. The most\n vexatious thing that the law has in it, the allowing a cause to be twice pleaded,\n has either been instituted for my sake rather than for yours, or, at all events, not\n more for your sake than for mine. For if to speak twice be an advantage, certainly\n it is an advantage which is common to both If there is a necessity that he who has\n spoken last should be refuted, then it is for the sake of the prosecutor that the he\n has been established that there should be a second discussion. But, as I imagine,\n Glaucia first proposed the law that the defendant might have an adjournment; before\n that time the decision might either be given at once, or the judges might take time\n to consider. Which law, then, do you think the mildest? I think that ancient one, by\n which a man might either be acquitted quickly, or condemned after deliberation. I\n restore you that law of Acilius, according to which many men who have only been\n accused once, whose cause has only been pleaded once, in whose case witnesses have\n only been heard once, have been condemned on charges by no means so clearly proved,\n nor so flagitious as those on which you are convicted. Think that you are pleading\n your cause, not according to that severe law, but according to that most merciful\n one. I will accuse you; you shall reply. Having produced my witnesses, I will lay\n the whole matter before the bench in such a way, that even if the law gave them a\n power of adjournment, yet they shall think it discreditable to themselves not to\n decide at the first hearing. \n ",
                "26":"\n But if it be necessary for the cause to be thoroughly investigated, has this one\n been investigated but superficially? Are we keeping back anything, O Hortensius, a\n trick which we have often seen practiced in pleading? Who ever attends much to the\n advocate in this sort of action, in which anything is said to have been carried off\n and stolen by any one? Is not all the expectation of the judges fixed on the\n documents or on the witnesses? I said in the first pleading that I would make it\n plain that Caius Verres had carried off four hundred thousand sesterces contrary to the law. What ought I to have said? Should I have\n pleaded more plainly if I had related the whole affair thus?—There was a certain man\n of Halesa, named Dio, who, when a great inheritance had come to his son from a\n relation while Sacerdos was praetor, had at the time no trouble nor dispute about\n it. Verres, as soon as he arrived in the province, immediately wrote letters from\n Messana ; he summoned Dio before him, he\n procured false witnesses from among his own friends to say that that inheritance had\n been forfeited to Venus Erycina. He announced that he himself would take cognisance\n of that matter. \n ",
                "27":"\n I can detail to you the whole affair in regular order, and at last tell you what\n the result was, namely, that Dio paid a million of sesterces , in order to prevail in a cause of most undeniable justice,\n besides that Verres had his herds of mares driven away, and all his plate and\n embroidered vestments carried off. But neither while I was so relating these things,\n nor while you were denying them, would our speeches be of any great importance. At\n what time then would the judge prick up his ears and begin to strain his attention?\n When Dio himself came forward, and the others who had at that time been engaged in\n Sicily on Dio's business, when, at the\n very time when Dio was pleading his cause, he was proved to have borrowed money, to\n have galled in all that was owing to him, to have sold farms; when the accounts of\n respectable men were produced, when they who had supplied Dio with money said that\n they had heard at the time that the money was taken on purpose to be given to\n Verres; when the friends, and connections, and patrons of Dio, most honourable men,\n said that they had heard the same thing. \n ",
                "28":"\n Then, when this was going on, you would, I suppose, attend as you did attend. Then\n the cause would seem to be going on. Everything was managed by me in the former\n pleading so that among all the charges there was not one in which any one of you\n desired an uninterrupted statement of the case. I deny that anything was said by the\n witnesses which was either obscure to any one of you, or which required the\n eloquence of any orator to set it off. In truth, you must recollect that I conducted the case in this way;\n I set forth and detailed the whole charge at the time of the examination of\n witnesses, so that as soon as I had explained the whole affair, I then immediately\n examined the witnesses. And by that means, not only you, who have to judge, are in\n possession of our charges, but also the Roman people became acquainted with the\n whole accusation and the whole cause: although I am speaking of my own conduct as if\n I had done so of my own will rather than because I was induced to do so by any\n injustice of yours. \n ",
                "29":"\n But you interposed another accuser, who, when I had only demanded a hundred and\n ten days to prosecute my inquiries in Sicily , demanded a hundred and eight for himself to go for a similar\n purpose into Achaia . When you had deprived\n me of the three months most suitable for conducting my cause, you thought that I\n would give you up the remainder of the year, so that, when he had employed the time\n allowed to me, you, O Hortensius, after the interruption of two festivals, might\n make your reply forty days afterwards; and then, that the time might be so spun out,\n that we might come from Marius Glabrio, the praetor, and from the greater part of\n these judges, to another praetor, and other judges. \n ",
                "30":"\n If I had not seen this—if every one, both acquaintances and strangers, had not\n warned me that the object which they were driving at, which they were contriving,\n for which they were striving, was to cause the matter to be delayed to that time—I\n suppose, if I had chosen to spend all the time allowed me in stating the accusation,\n I should be under apprehensions that I should not have charges enough to bring, that\n subjects for a speech would be wanting to me, that my voice and strength would fail\n me, that I should not be able to accuse twice a man whom no one had dared to defend\n at the first pleading of the cause. I made my conduct appear reasonable both to the\n judges and also to the Roman people. There is no one who thinks that their injustice\n and impudence could have been opposed by any other means. Indeed, how great would\n have been my folly, if, though I might have avoided it, I had allowed matters to\n come on on the day which they who had undertaken to deliver him from justice\n provided for in their undertaking, when they gave their undertaking to deliver him\n in these words—“If the trial took place on or after the first of January?” \n ",
                "31":"\n Now I must provide for the careful management of the time which is allowed me for\n making a speech, since I am determined to state the whole case most fully.\n Therefore I will pass\n by that first act of his life, most infamous and most wicked as it was. He shall\n hear nothing from me of the vices and offences of his childhood, nothing about his\n most dissolute youth: how that youth was spent, you either remember, or else you can\n recognise it in the son whom he has brought up to be so like himself: I will pass\n over everything which appears shameful to be mentioned; and I will consider not only\n what that fellow ought to have said of himself, but also what it becomes me to say.\n Do you, I entreat you, permit this, and grant to my modesty, that it may be allowed\n to pass over in silence some portion of his shamelessness. \n ",
                "32":"\n At that time which passed before he came into office and became a public\n character, he may have free and untouched as far as I am concerned. Nothing shall be\n said of his drunken nocturnal revels; no mention shall be made of his pimps, and\n dicers, and panders; his losses at play, and the licentious transactions which the\n estate of his father and his own age prompted him to shall be passed over in\n silence. He may have lived in all infamy at that time with impunity, as far as I am\n concerned; the rest of his life has been such that I can well afford to put up with\n the loss of not mentioning those enormities. \n ",
                "33":"\n You were quaestors to Cnaeus Papirius the consul fourteen years ago. All that you\n have done from that day to this day I bring before the court. Not one hour will be\n found free from theft, from wickedness, from cruelty, from atrocity. These years\n have been passed by you in the quaestorship, and in the lieutenancy in Asia , and in the city praetorship, and in the\n Sicilian praetorship. On which account a division of my whole action will also be\n made into four parts. As\n quaestor you received our province by lot, according to the decree of the senate. A\n consular province fell to your lot, so that you were with Cnaeus Carbo, the consul,\n and had that province. There was at that time dissension among the citizens: and in\n that I am not going to say anything as to what part you ought to have taken. This\n only do I say, that at such a time as that you ought to have made up your mind which\n side you would take and which party you would espouse. Carbo was very indignant that\n there had fallen to his lot as his quaestor a man of such notorious luxury and\n indolence. But he loaded him with all sorts of kindnesses. Not to dwell too long on\n this; money was voted, was paid; he went as quaestor to the\n province; he came into Gaul , where he had\n been for some time expected, to the army of the consul with the money. At the very\n first opportunity that offered, (take notice of the principle on which the man\n discharged the duties of his offices, and administered the affairs of the republic,)\n the quaestor, having embezzled the public money, deserted the consul, the army, and\n his allotted province. \n ",
                "34":"\n I see what I have done; he rouses himself up; he hopes that, in the instance of\n this charge, some breeze may be wafted this way of good will and approbation for\n those men to him the name of Cnaeus Carbo, though dead, is unwelcome, and to whom he\n hopes that that desertion and betrayal of his consul will prove acceptable. As if he\n had done it from any desire to take the part of the nobility, or from any party\n zeal, and had not rather openly pillaged the consul, the army and the province, and\n then, because of this most impudent theft, had run away. For such an action as that\n is obscure, and such that one may suspect that Caius Verres, because he could not\n bear new men, passed over to the nobility, that is, to his own party, and that he\n did nothing from consideration of money. \n ",
                "35":"\n Let us see how he gave in his accounts; now he himself will show why he left\n Cnaeus Carbo; now he himself will show what he is. First of all take notice of their brevity—“I received,”\n says he, “two million two hundred and thirty-five thousand four hundred and\n seventeen sesterces ; I spent, for pay to the\n soldiers, for corn, for the lieutenants, for the pro-quaestor, for the praetorian\n cohort, sixteen hundred and thirty-five thousand four hundred and seventeen sesterces ; I left at Ariminum six hundred thousand sesterces .” Is this giving in accounts? Did either I, or you, O\n Hortensius, or any man ever give in his accounts in this manner? What does this\n mean? what impudence it is! what audacity! What precedent is there of any such in\n all the number of accounts that have ever been rendered by public officers? And yet\n these six hundred thousand sesterces , as to which\n he could not even devise a false account of whom he had paid them to, and which he\n said he had left at Ariminum ,—these\n six hundred thousand sesterces which he had in\n hand, Carbo never touched, Sulla never saved them, nor were these ever brought into\n the treasury. He selected Ariminum as\n the town, because at the time when he was giving in his accounts, it had been taken\n and plundered. He did not suspect, what he shall now find out, that plenty of the\n Ariminians were left to us after that disaster as witnesses to that point. Read now—\n \n ",
                "36":"\n “Accounts rendered to Publius Lentulus, and Lucius Triarius, quaestors of the\n city.” Read on—“According to the decree of the senate.” In order to be allowed to\n give in accounts in such a manner as this, he became one of Sulla's party in an\n instant, and not for the sake of contributing to the restoration of honour and\n dignity to the nobility. Even if you had deserted empty-handed, still your desertion\n would be decided to be wicked, your betrayal of your consul, infamous. Oh, Cnaeus\n Carbo was a bad citizen, a scandalous consul, a seditious man. He may have been so\n to others: when did he begin to be so to you? After he entrusted to you the money,\n the supplying of corn, all his accounts, and his army; for if he had displeased you\n before that, you would have done the same as Marcus Piso did the year after. When he\n had fallen by lot to Lucius Scipio, as consul, he never touched the money, he never\n joined the army at all. The opinions he embraced concerning the republic he embraced\n so as to do no violence to his own good faith, to the customs of our ancestors, nor\n to the obligations imposed on him by the lot which he had drawn. \n ",
                "37":"\n In truth, if we wish to disturb all these things, and to throw them into\n confusion, we shall render life full of danger, intrigue, and enmity; if such\n allurements are to have no scruples to protect them; if the connection between men\n in prosperous and doubtful fortunes is to cause no friendship; if the customs and\n principles of our ancestors are to have no authority. He is the common enemy of all\n men who has once been the enemy of his own connections. No wise man ever thought\n that a traitor was to be trusted; Sulla himself, to whom the arrival of the fellow\n ought to have been most acceptable, removed him from himself and from his army: he\n ordered him to remain at Beneventum ,\n among those men whom he believed to be exceedingly friendly to his party, where he\n could do no harm to his cause and could have no influence on the termination of the\n war. Afterwards, indeed, he rewarded him liberally; he allowed him to seize some\n estates of men who had been proscribed lying in the territory of Beneventum ; he loaded him with honour as a\n traitor; he put no confidence in him as a friend. \n ",
                "38":"\n Now, although there are men who hate Cnaeus Carbo, though dead, yet they ought to\n think, not what they were glad to have happen, but what they themselves would have\n to fear in a similar case. This is a misfortune common to many a cause for alarm,\n and a danger common to many. There are no intrigues more difficult to guard against\n than those which are concealed under a pretence of duty, or under the name of some\n intimate connection. For you can easily avoid one who is openly an adversary, by\n guarding against him; but this secret, internal, and domestic evil not only exists,\n but even overwhelms you before you can foresee it or examine into it. Is it not so?\n \n ",
                "39":"\n When you were sent as quaestor to the army, not only as guardian of the money, but\n also of the consul; when you were the sharer in all his business and of all his\n counsels, when you were considered by him as one of his own children, according to\n the tenor of the principles of our ancestors; could you on a sudden leave him?\n desert him? pass over to the enemy? O wickedness! O monster to be banished to the\n very end of the world! For that nature which has committed such an atrocity as this\n cannot be contented with this one crime alone. It must be always contriving\n something of this sort; it must be occupied in similar audacity and perfidy. \n ",
                "40":"\n Therefore, that same fellow whom Cnaeus Dolabella afterwards, when Caius Malleolus\n had been slain, had for his quaestor, (I know not whether this connection was not\n even a closer one than the connection with Carbo, and whether the consideration of\n his having been voluntarily chosen is not stronger than that of his having been\n chosen by lot,) behaved to Cnaeus Dolabella in the same manner as he had behaved in\n to Cnaeus Carbo. For, the charges which properly touched himself, he transferred to\n his shoulders; and gave information of everything connected with his cause to his\n enemies and accusers. He himself gave most hostile and most infamous evidence\n against the man to whom he had been lieutenant and pro-quaestor. Dolabella,\n unfortunate as he was, through his abominable betrayal, through his infamous and\n false testimony, was injured far more than by either, by the odium created by that\n fellow's own thefts and atrocities. \n ",
                "41":"\n What can you do with such a man? or what hope can you allow so perfidious, so\n ill-omened an animal to entertain? One who despised and trampled on the lot which\n bound him to Cnaeus Carbo, the choice which connected him with Cnaeus Dolabella, and\n not only deserted them both, but also betrayed and attacked them. Do not, I beg of\n you, O judges, judge of his crimes by the brevity of my speech rather than by the\n magnitude of the actions themselves. For I am forced to make haste in order to have\n time to set before you all the things which I have resolved to relate to you.\n Wherefore, now that his quaestorship has been put before you, saw that the\n dishonesty and wickedness of his first conduct in his first office has been\n thoroughly seen, listen, I pray you, to the remainder. \n ",
                "42":"\n And in this I will pass over that period of proscription and rapine which took\n place under Sulla; nor will I allow him to derive any argument for his own defence\n from that time of common calamity to all men. I will accuse him of nothing but his\n own peculiar and well-proved crimes. Therefore, omitting all mention of the time of\n Sulla from the accusation, consider that splendid lieutenancy of his. After\n Cilicia was appointed to Cnaeus Dolabella\n as his province, O ye immortal gods! with what covetousness, with what incessant\n applications, did he force from him that lieutenancy for himself, which was indeed\n the beginning of the greatest calamity to Dolabella. For as he proceeded on his\n journey to the province, wherever he went his conduct was such, that it was not some\n lieutenant of the Roman people, but rather some calamity that seemed to be going\n through the country. \n ",

Do not let this be considered a crime in Verres; others\n have done the tame. When he could not give it, he punished him; a scandalous, but\n still not an unheard-of act. Listen to the sort of punishment; you will ask, of what\n race of men you are to think him a specimen. He ordered a fire to be made of green\n and damp wood in a narrow place. There he left a free man, a noble in his own\n country, an ally and friend of the Roman people, tortured with smoke, half dead.\n \n ",

There is\n another part of my speech which I have reserved for speaking of this covetousness of\n the man. You have heard that at Athens a\n great sum of money was taken out of the temple of Minerva. This was mentioned in the\n trial of Cnaeus Dolabella. Mentioned? the amount too was stated. Of this design you\n will find that Caius Verres was not only a partaker, but was even the chief\n instigator. \n ",

For the holiness and antiquity\n of that temple is so great in their eyes, that they believe that Apollo himself was\n born in that place. However, they did not dare to say one word about it, lest haply\n Dolabella himself might be concerned in the business. Then on a sudden a very great tempest\n arose, O judges; so that Dolabella could not only not depart, when he wished, but\n could scarcely stand in the city, such vast waves were dashed on shore. Here that\n ship of that pirate loaded with the consecrated statues, being cast up and driven\n ashore by the waves, is broken to pieces.

                "49":"\n But that storming of that most ancient and most noble temple of the Samian Juno,\n how grievous was it to the Samians! how bitter to all Asia ! how notorious to all men! how notorious to every one of you!\n And when ambassadors had come from Samos \n into Asia to Caius Nero, to complain of\n this attack on that temple, they received for answer, that complaints of that sort,\n which concerned a lieutenant of the Roman people, ought not to be brought before the\n praetor, but must be carried to Rome . What\n pictures did he carry off from thence; what statues! which I saw lately in his\n house, when I went thither for the sake of sealing it up. \n ",
                "50":"\n And where are those statues now, O Verres? I mean those which I lately saw in your\n house against every pillar, and also in every space between two pillars, and\n actually arranged in the grove in the open air? Why were those things left at your\n house, as long as you thought that another praetor, with the other judges whom you\n expected to have substituted in the room of these, was to sit in judgment upon your?\n But when you saw that we preferred suiting the convenience of our own witnesses\n rather than your convenience as to time, you left not one statue in your house\n except two which were in the middle of it, and which were themselves stolen from\n Samos . Did you not think that I would\n summon your most intimate friends to give evidence of this matter, who had often\n been at your house, and ask of them whether they knew that statues were there which\n were not? \n ",
                "51":"\n What did you think that these men would think of you then, when they saw that you\n were no longer contending against your accuser, but against the quaestor and the\n brokers? On which matter you heard Charidemus of Chios give his evidence at the former pleadings,\n that he, when he was captain of a trireme, and was attending Verres on his departure\n from Asia , was with him at Samos , by command of Dolabella and that he then knew\n that the temple of Juno had been plundered, and the town of Samos ; that afterwards he had been put on his trial\n before the Chians, his fellow citizens, on the accusation of the Samians; and that\n he had been acquitted because he had made it plain that the allegations of the\n Samians concerned Verres, and not him. \n ",
                "52":"\n You know that Aspendus is an ancient and\n noble town in Pamphylia , full of very fine\n statues. I do not say that one statue or another was taken away from thence: this I\n say, that you, O Verres, left not one statue at Aspendus ; that everything from the temples and from all public places\n was openly seized and carried away on wagons, the citizens all looking on. And he\n even carried off that harp-player of Aspendus , of whom you have often heard the saying, which is a proverb\n among the Greeks, who used to say that he could sing everything within himself, and\n put him in the inmost part of his own house, so as to appear to have surpassed the\n statue itself in trickery. \n ",
                "53":"\n At Perga we are aware that there is a very ancient and very holy temple of Diana.\n That too, I say, was stripped and plundered by you; and all the gold which there was\n on Diana herself was taken off and carried away. What, in the name of mischief, can\n such audacity and inanity mean? In the very cities of our friends and allies, which\n you visited under the pretext of your office as lieutenant, if you had stormed them\n by force with an army, and had exercised military rule there; still, I think, the\n statues and ornaments which you took away, you would have carried, not to your own\n house, nor to the suburban villas of your friends, but to Rome for the public use. \n ",
                "54":"\n Why should I speak of Marcus Marcellus, who took Syracuse , that most beautiful city? why of Lucius Scipio, who waged\n war in Asia , and conquered Antiochus, a\n most powerful monarch? why of Flaminius, who subdued Philip the king, and Macedonia ? why of Lucius Paullus, who with his might\n and valour conquered king Perses? why of Lucius Mummius, who overthrew that most\n beautiful and elegant city Corinth ,\n full of all sorts of riches, and brought many cities of Achaia and Boeotia under the\n empire and dominion of the Roman people?—their houses, though they were rich in\n virtue and honour, were empty of statues and paintings. But we see the whole city,\n the temples of the gods, and all parts of Italy , adorned with their gifts, and with memorials of them. \n ",
                "55":"\n I am afraid all this may seem to some people too ancient, and long ago obsolete.\n For at that time all men were so uniformly disposed in the same manner, that this\n credit of eminent virtue and incorruptibility appears to belong, not only to those\n men, but also to those times. Publius Servilius, a most illustrious man, who has\n performed the noblest exploits, is present. He will deliver his opinion on your\n conduct. He, by his power, had forces; his wisdom and his valour took Olympus , an ancient city, and one strengthened and\n embellished in every possible manner. I am bringing forward recent example of a most\n distinguished man. For Servilius, as a general of the Roman people, took Olympus after you, as lieutenant of the quaestor in\n the same district, had taken care to harass and plunder all the cities of our\n friends and allies even when they were at peace. \n ",
                "56":"\n The things which you carried off from the holiest temples with wickedness, and\n like a robber, we cannot see, except in your own houses, or in those of your\n friends. The statues and decorations which Publius Servilius brought away from the\n cities of our enemies, taken by his courage and valour, according to the laws of war\n and his own rights as commander-in-chief, he brought home for the Roman people; he\n carried them in his triumph, and took care that a description of them should be\n engraved on public tablets and hid up in the treasury. You may learn from public\n documents the industry of that most honourable man. Read—“The accounts delivered by\n Publius Servilius.” You see not only the number of the statues, but the size, the\n figure, and the condition of each one among them accurately described in writing.\n Certainly, the delight arising from virtue and from victory is much greater than\n that pleasure which is derived from licentiousness and covetousness. I say that\n Servilius took much more care to have the booty of the Roman people noted and\n described, than you took to have your plunder catalogued. \n ",
                "57":"\n You will say that your statues and paintings were also an ornament to the city and\n forum of the Roman people. I recollect: I, together with the Roman people, saw the\n forum and place for holding the assemblies adorned with embellishments, in\n appearance indeed magnificent, but to one's senses and thoughts bitter and\n melancholy. I saw everything glittering with your thefts, with the plunder of the\n provinces, with the spoils of our allies and friends. At which time, O judges, that\n fellow conceived the hope of committing his other crimes. For he saw that these men,\n who wished to be called the masters of the courts of law, were slaves to these\n desires. \n ",
                "58":"\n But the allies and foreign nations then first abandoned the hope of saving any of\n their property and fortunes, because, as it happened, there were at that time very\n many ambassadors from Asia and Achaia at Rome , who worshipped in the forum the images of the gods which had\n been taken from their temples. And so also, when they recognised the other statues\n and ornaments, they wept, as they beheld the different pieces of their property in\n different place. And from all those men we then used to hear discourses of this\n sort:—“That it was impossible for any one to doubt of the ruin of our allies and\n friends, when men saw in the forum of the Roman people, in which formerly those men\n used to be accused and condemned who had done any injury to the allies, those things\n now openly placed which had been wickedly seized and taken away from the allies.”\n \n ",
                "59":"\n Here I do not expect that he will deny that he has many statues, and countless\n paintings. But, as I fancy, he is accustomed at times to say that he purchased these\n things which he seized and stole; since indeed he was sent at the public expense,\n and with the title of ambassador, into Achaia , Asia , and Pamphylia as a purchaser of statues and paintings.\n I have all the accounts\n both of that fellow and of his father, of money received, which I have most\n carefully read and arranged; those of your father, as long as he lived, you own, as\n far as you say that you have made them up. For in that man, O judges, you will find\n this new thing. We hear that some men have never kept accounts; which is a mistaken\n opinion of men with respect to Antonius; for he kept them most carefully. But there\n may be men of that sort, but they are by no means to be approved of. We hear that\n some men have not kept them from the beginning, but after some time have made them\n up; there is a way of accounting for this too. But this is unprecedented and absurd\n which this man gave us for an answer, when we demanded his account of him: “That he\n kept them up to the consulship of Marcus Terentius and Caius Cassius; but that,\n after that, he gave up keeping them.” \n ",
                "60":"\n In another place we will consider what sort of a reply this is; at present I am\n not concerned with it; for of the times about which I am at present occupied I have\n the accounts, both yours and those of your father. You cannot deny that you carried\n off very many most beautiful statues, very many admirable paintings. I wish you\n would deny it. Show in your accounts or in those of your father that any one of them\n was purchased, and you have gained your cause. There is not even any possibility of\n your having bought those two most beautiful statues which are now standing in your\n court, and which stood for many years by the folding doors of the Samian Juno; these\n two, I say, which are now the only statues left in your house, which are waiting for\n the broker, left alone and deserted by the other statues. \n ",
                "61":"\n But, I suppose in these matters alone had he this irrepressible and unbridled\n covetousness; his other desires were restrained by some reason and moderation. To\n how many noble virgins, to how many matrons do you think he offered violence in that\n foul and obscene lieutenancy? In what town did he set his foot that he did not leave\n more traces of his rapes and atrocities than he did of his arrival? But I will pass\n over everything which can be denied; even those things which are most certain and\n most evident I will omit; I will select one of his abominable deeds, in order that I\n may the more easily at last arrive at Sicily , which has imposed the burden of this business on me. \n ",
                "62":"\n There is a town on the Hellespont , O\n judges, called Lampsacus , among the first\n in the province of Asia for renown and for\n nobleness. And the citizens themselves of Lampsacus are most especially kind to all Roman citizens, and also\n are an especially quiet and orderly race; almost beyond all the rest of the Greeks\n inclined to the most perfect ease, rather than to any disorder or tumult. It\n happened, when he had prevailed on Cnaeus Dolabella to send him to king Nicomedes\n and to king Sadala, and when he had begged this expedition, more with a view to his\n own gain than to any advantage for the republic, that in that journey he came to\n Lampsacus , to the great misfortune and\n almost ruin of the city. He is conducted to the house of a man named Janitor as his\n host; and his companions also, are billeted on other entertainers. As was the\n fellow's custom, and as his lusts always instigating him to commit some wickedness\n prompted him, he immediately gives a commission to his companions, the most\n worthless and infamous of men, to inquire and find out whether there is any virgin\n woman worthy of his staying longer at Lampsacus for her sake. \n ",
                "63":"\n He had a companion of the name of Rubrius, a man made for such vices as his, who\n used to find out all these things for him wherever he went, with wonderful address.\n He brings him the following news,—that there was a man of the name of Philodamus, in\n birth, in rank, in wealth, and in reputation by far the first man among the citizens\n of Lampsacus ; that his daughter, who was\n living with her father because she had not yet got a husband, was a woman of\n extraordinary beauty, but was also considered exceedingly modest and virtuous. The\n fellow, when he heard this, was so inflamed with desire for that which he had not\n only not seen himself, but which even he from whom he heard of it had not seen\n himself, that he said he should like to go to Philodamus immediately. Janitor, his\n host, who suspected nothing, being afraid that he must have given him some offence\n himself, endeavoured with all his might to detain him. Verres, as he could not find\n any pretext for leaving his host's house began to pave his way for his meditated\n violence by other steps. He says that Rubrius, his most loved friend, his assistant\n in all such matters, and the partner of his counsels, is lodged with but little\n comfort. He orders him to be conducted to the house of Philodamus. \n ",
                "64":"\n But when this is reported to Philodamus, although he was ignorant what great\n misfortune was at that moment being contrived for him and for his children, still he\n comes to him,—represents to him that that is not his office,—that when it was his\n turn to receive guests, he was accustomed to receive the praetors and consuls\n themselves, and not the attendants of lieutenants. Verres, as he was hurried on by\n that one desire alone, disregarded all his demands and allegations, and ordered\n Rubrius to be introduced by force into the house of a man who had a right to refuse\n him admittance. On this,\n Philodamus, when he could not preserve his rights, studied at least to preserve his\n courtesy and affability. He who had always been considered most hospitable and most\n friendly towards our people, did not like to appear to have received even this\n fellow Rubrius into his house unwillingly; he prepares a banquet magnificently and\n luxuriously, being, as he was, among the richest of all his fellow citizens; he begs\n Rubrius to invite whoever were agreeable to himself; to leave, if he pleased, just\n room for himself alone. He even sends his own son, a most excellent youth, out to\n one of his relations to supper. \n ",
                "65":"\n Rubrius invites Verres's companions; Verres informs them all what there was to be\n done. They come early. They sit down to supper. Conversation takes place among them,\n and an invitation is given to drink in the Greek fashion. The host encourages them;\n they demand wine in larger goblets; the banquet proceeds with the conversation and\n joy of every one. When the business appeared to Rubrius to have got warm enough, “I\n would know of you, O Philodamus,” says he, “why you do not bid your daughter to be\n invited in hither to us?” The man, who was both a most dignified man, and of mature\n age, and a parent, was amazed at the speech of the rascal. Rubrius began to urge it.\n Then he, in order to give some answer, said that it was not the custom of the Greeks\n for women to sit down at the banquets of men. On this some one else from some other\n part of the room cried out, “But this is not to be borne; let the women be\n summoned.” And immediately Rubrius orders his slaves to shut the door, and to stand\n at the doors themselves. \n ",
                "66":"\n But when Philodamus perceived that what was intended and being prepared was, that\n violence should be offered to his daughter, he calls his servants to him, he bids\n them disregard him and defend his daughter, and orders some one to run out and bear\n the news to his son of this overpowering domestic misfortune. Meantime an uproar\n arises throughout the whole house; a fight takes place between the slaves of Rubrius\n and his host. That noble and most honourable man is buffeted about in his own house;\n every one fights for his own safety. At last Philodamus has a quantity of boiling\n water thrown over him by Rubrius himself. When the news of this is brought to the\n son, half dead with alarm he instantly hastens home to bring aid to save the life of\n his father and the modesty of his sister. All the citizens of Lampsacus , with the same spirit, the moment they\n heard of it, because both the worth of Philodamus and the enormity of the injury\n excited them, assembled by night at his house. At this time Cornelius, the lictor of\n Verres, who had been placed with his slaves by Rubrius, as if on guard, for the\n purpose of carrying off the woman, is slain; some of the slaves are wounded; Rubrius\n himself is wounded in the crowd. Verres, when he saw such an uproar excited by his\n own cupidity, began to wish to escape some way or other if he could. \n ",
                "67":"\n The next morning men come early to the public assembly; they ask what is best to\n be done; every one delivered his own opinions to the people according as each\n individual had the most weight. No one was found whose opinion and speech was not to\n this purpose:—“That it need not be feared, if the Lampsacenes had avenged that man's\n atrocious wickedness by force and by the sword, that the senate and Roman people\n would have thought they ought to chastise their city. And if the lieutenants of the\n Roman people were to establish this law with respect to the allies, and to foreign\n nations,—that they were not to be allowed to preserve the chastity of their children\n unpolluted by their lusts, it was better to endure anything rather than to live in a\n state of such violence and bitterness.” \n ",
                "68":"\n As all were of this opinion, and as every one spoke in this tenor, as his own\n feelings and indignation prompted each individual, all immediately proceeded towards\n the house where Verres was staying. They began to beat the door with stones, to\n attack it with weapons, to surround it with wood and faggots, and to apply fire to\n it. Then the Roman citizens who were dwelling as traders at Lampsacus run together to the spot; they entreat the\n citizens of Lampsacus to allow the name of\n the lieutenancy to have more weight with them than the insult of the lieutenant;\n they say that they were well aware that he was an infamous and wicked man, but as he\n had not accomplished what he had attempted, and as he was not going to be at\n Lampsacus any longer, their error in\n sparing a wicked man would be less than that of not sparing a lieutenant. \n ",
                "69":"\n And so that fellow, far more wicked and infamous than even the notorious Hadrian,\n was a good deal\n more fortunate. He, because Roman citizens could not tolerate his avarice, was burnt\n alive at Utica in his own house; and that\n was thought to have happened to him so deservedly, that all men rejoiced, and no\n punishment was inflicted for the deed. This man, scorched indeed though he was by\n the fire made by our allies, yet escaped from those flames and that danger; and has\n not even yet been able to imagine what he had done, or what had happened to bring\n him into such great danger. For he cannot say:—“When I was trying to put down a\n sedition, when I was ordering corn, when I was collecting money for the soldiers,\n when in short I was doing something or other for the sake of the republic, because I\n gave some strict order, because I punished some one, because I threatened some one,\n all this happened.” Even if he were to say so, still he ought not to be pardoned, if\n he seemed to have been brought into such great danger through issuing too savage\n commands to our allies. \n ",
                "70":"\n Now when he neither dares himself to allege any such cause for the tumult as being\n true, nor even to invent such a falsehood, but when a most temperate man of his own\n order, who at that time was in attendance on Caius Nero, Publius Tettius, says that\n he too heard this same account at Lampsacus , (a man most accomplished in everything, Caius Varro, who was\n at that time in Asia as military tribune,\n says that be heard this very same story from Philodamus,) can you doubt that fortune\n was willing, not so much to save him from that danger, as to reserve him for your\n judgment! Unless, indeed, he will say, as indeed Hortensius did say, interrupting\n Tettius while he was giving his evidence in the former pleading (at which time\n indeed he gave plenty of proof that, if there were anything which he could say, he\n could not keep silence; so that we may all feel sure that, while he was silent in\n the other matters that were alleged, he was so because he had nothing to say); he at\n that time said this, that Philodamus and his son had been condemned by Caius Nero.\n \n ",
                "71":"\n About which, not to make a long speech, I will merely say that Nero and his bench\n of judges came to that decision on the ground that it was plain that Cornelius, his\n lictor, had been slain, and that they thought it was not right that any one, even\n while avenging his own injuries, should have the power to kill a man. And as to this\n I see that you were not by Nero's sentence acquitted of atrocity, but that they were\n convicted of murder. And yet what sort of a conviction was that? Listen, I entreat\n you, O judges, and do sometimes pity our allies, and show that they ought to have,\n and that they have, some protection in your integrity. Because the man appeared to all\n Asia to have been lawfully slain, being\n in name indeed his lictor, but in reality the minister of his most profligate\n desires, Verres feared that Philodamus would be acquitted by the sentence of Nero.\n He begs and entreats Dolabella to leave his own province, to go to Nero; he shows\n that he himself cannot be safe if Philodamus be allowed to live and at any time to\n come to Rome . \n ",
                "72":"\n Dolabella was moved; he did what many blamed, in leaving his army, his province,\n and the war, and in going into Asia , into\n the province of another magistrate, for the sake of a most worthless man. After he\n came to Nero, he urged him to take cognisance of the cause of Philodamus. He came\n himself to sit on the bench, and to be the first to deliver his opinion. He had\n brought with him also his prefects, and his military tribunes, all of whom Nero\n invited to take their places on the bench On that bench also was that most just\n judge Verres himself. There were some Romans also, creditors of some of the Greeks,\n to whom the favour of any lieutenant, be he ever so infamous, is of the greatest\n influence in enabling them to get in their money. \n ",
                "73":"\n The unhappy prisoner could find no one to defend him; for what citizen was there\n who was not under the influence of Dolabella? what Greek who was not afraid of his\n power and authority? And then is assigned as the accuser a Roman citizen, one of the\n creditors of the Lampsacenes; and if he would only say what that fellow ordered him\n to say, he was to be enabled to compel payment of his money from the people, by the\n aid of that same Verres's lictors. When all these thing; were conducted with such\n zeal, and with such resources; when many were accusing that unhappy man, and no one\n was defending him; and when Dolabella, with his prefects, was taking an eager part\n on the bench; when Verres kept saying that his fortunes were at stake—when he also\n gave his evidence—when he also was sitting on the bench—when he also had provided\n the accuser; when all this was done, and when it was clear that the man had been\n slain, still, so great was the weight which the consideration of bat fellow's injury\n had, so great was his iniquity thought, that the case of Philodamus was adjourned\n for further inquiry. \n ",
                "74":"\n Why need I now speak of the energy of Cnaeus Dolabella at the second hearing of\n the cause,—of his tears of his agitation of body and minds? Why need I describe the\n mind of Caius Nero,—a most virtuous and innocent man, but still on some occasions\n too timid and low spirited?—who in that emergency had no idea what to do, unless,\n perchance (as every one wished him to do), to settle the matter without the\n intervention of Verres and Dolabella. Whatever had been done without their\n intervention all men would approve; but, as it was, the sentence which was given was\n thought not to have been pronounced judicially by Nero, but to have been extorted by\n Dolabella. For Philodamus and his son are convicted by a few votes: Dolabella is\n present; urges and presses Nero to have them executed as speedily as possible, in\n order that as few as may be may bear of that man's nefarious wickedness. \n ",
                "75":"\n There is exhibited in the market-place of Laodicea a spectacle bitter, and miserable, and grievous to the whole\n province of Asia —an aged parent led forth\n to punishment, and on the other side a son; the one because he had defended the\n chastity of his children, the other because he had defended the life of his father\n and the fair fame of his sister. Each was weeping,—the father, not for his own\n execution, but for that of his son; the son for that of his father. How many tears\n do you think that Nero himself sheds? How great do you think was the weeping of all\n Asia? How great the groans and lamentations of the citizens of Lampsacus , that innocent men, nobles, allies and\n friends of the Roman people, should be put to death by public execution, on account\n of the unprecedented wickedness and impious desires of one most profligate man? \n ",
                "76":"\n After this, O Dolabella, no one can pity either you or your children, whom you\n have left miserable, in beggary and solitude. Was Verres so dear to you, that you\n should wish the disappointment of his lust to be expiated by the blood of innocent\n men? Did you leave your army and the enemy, in order by your own power and cruelty\n to diminish the dangers of that most wicked man? For, had you expected him to be an\n everlasting friend to you, because you had appointed him to act as your quaestor?\n Did you not know, that Cnaeus Carbo, the consul whose real quaestor he had been, had\n not only been deserted by him, but had also been deprived of his resources and his\n money, and nefariously attacked and betrayed by him? Therefore, you too experienced\n his perfidy when he joined your enemies,—when he, himself a most guilty man, gave\n most damaging evidence against you—when he refused to give in his accounts to the\n treasury unless you were condemned. \n \n ",
                "77":"\n Are your lusts, O Verres, to be so atrocious, that the provinces of the Roman\n people, that foreign nations, cannot limit and cannot endure them? Unless whatever\n you see, whatever you hear, whatever you desire, whatever you think of, is in a\n moment to be subservient to your nod, is at once to obey your lust and desire, are\n men to be sent into people's houses? are the houses to be stormed? Are cities—not\n only the cities of enemies now reduced to peace—but are the cities of our allies and\n friends to be forced to have recourse to violence and to arms, in order to be able\n to repel from themselves and from their children the wickedness and lust of a\n lieutenant of the Roman people? For I ask of you, were you besieged at Lampsacus ? Did that multitude begin to burn the\n house in which you were staying? Did the citizens of Lampsacus wish to burn a lieutenant of the Roman people alive? You\n cannot deny it; for I have your own evidence which you gave before Nero,—I have the\n letters which you sent to him. Recite the passage from his evidence. \n ",

Did it wish to revolt from our dominion—to cast off the name of allies of\n Rome ? For I see, and, from those things\n which I have read and heard, I am sure, that, if in any city a lieutenant of the\n Roman people has been, not only besieged, not only attacked with fire and sword, by\n violence, and by armed forces, but even to some extent actually injured, unless\n satisfaction be publicly made for the insult, war is invariably declared and waged\n against that city. \n ",
                "79":"\n What, then, was the cause why the whole city of the Lampsacenes ran, as you write\n yourself, from the assembly to your house? For neither in the letters which you sent\n to Nero, nor in your evidence, do you mention any reason for so important a\n disturbance. You say that you were besieged, that fire was applied to your house,\n that faggots were put round it; you say that your lictor was slain; you say that you\n did not dare appear in the public streets; but the cause of all this alarm you\n conceal. For if Rubrius had done any injury to any one on his own account, and not\n at your instigation and for the gratification of your desires, they would rather\n have come to you to complain of the injury done by your companion, than have come to\n besiege you. As, therefore, he himself has concealed what the cause of that\n disturbance was, and as the witnesses produced by us have related it, do not both\n their evidence and his own continued silence prove the reason to be that which we\n have alleged? \n ",
                "80":"\n Will you then spare this man, O judges? whose offences are so great that they whom\n he injured could neither wait for the legitimate time to take their revenge, nor\n restrain to a future time the violence of their indignation. You were besieged? By\n whom? By the citizens of Lampsacus —barbarous men, I suppose, or, at all events, men who despised\n the name of the Roman people. Say rather, men, by nature, by custom, and by\n education most gentle; moreover, by condition, allies of the Roman people, by\n fortune our subjects, by inclination our suppliants—so that it is evident to all\n men, that unless the bitterness of the injury and the enormity of the wickedness had\n been such that the Lampsacenes thought it better to die than to endure it, they\n never would have advanced to such a pitch as to be more influenced by hatred of your\n lust—than by fear of your office as lieutenant. \n ",
                "81":"\n Do not, in the name of the immortal gods, I entreat you—do not compel the allies\n and foreign nations to have recourse to such a refuge as that; and they must of\n necessity have recourse to it, unless you chastise such crimes. Nothing would ever\n have softened the citizens of Lampsacus towards him, except their believing that he\n would be punished at Rome . Although they\n had sustained such an injury that they could not sufficiently avenge it by any law\n in the world, yet they would have preferred to submit their griefs to our laws and\n tribunals, rather than to give way to their own feelings of indignation. You, when\n you have been besieged by so illustrious a city on account of your own wickedness\n and crime—when you have compelled men, miserable and maddened by calamity, as if in\n despair of our laws and tribunals, to fly to violence, to combat, and to arms—when\n you have shown yourself in the towns and cities of our friends, not as a lieutenant\n of the Roman people, but as a lustful and inhuman tyrant—when among foreign nations\n you have injured the reputation of our dominion and our name by your infamy and your\n crimes—when you have with difficulty saved yourself from the sword of the friends of\n the Roman people, and escaped from the fire of its allies, do you think you will\n find an asylum here? You are mistaken—they allowed you to escape alive that you\n might fall into our power here, not that you might find rest here. \n ",
                "82":"\n And you say that a judicial decision was come to that you were injuriously\n besieged for no reason at Lampsacus ,\n because Philodamus and his son were condemned. What if I show, if I make it evident,\n by the evidence of a worthless man indeed, but still a competent witness in this\n matter,—by the evidence of you yourself,—that you yourself transferred the reason of\n this siege laid to you, and the blame of it, to others? and that those whom you had\n accused were not punished? Then the decision of Nero will do you but little good.\n Recite the letters which he sent to Nero. [The letter of Caius Verres to Nero is\n read.] “Themistagoras and Thessalus.” ... You write that Themistagoras and Thessalus\n stirred up the people. What people? They who besieged you; who endeavoured to burn\n you alive. Where do you prosecute them? Where do you accuse them? Where do you\n defend the name and rights of a lieutenant? Will you say that that was settled by\n the trial of Philodamus? Let me have the evidence of Verres himself. \n ",
                "83":"\n Let us see what that fellow said on his oath. Recite it. “Being asked by the\n accuser, he answered that he was not prosecuting for that in this trial, that he\n intended to prosecute for that another time.” How, then, does Nero's decision profit\n you?—how does the conviction of Philodamus? Though you, a lieutenant, had been\n besieged, and when, as you yourself write to Nero, a notorious injury had been done\n to the Roman people, and to the common cause of all lieutenants, you did not\n prosecute. You said that you intended to prosecute at some other time When was that\n time? When have you prosecuted? Why have you taken so much from the rights of a\n lieutenant's rank? Why have you abandoned and betrayed the cause of the Roman\n people? Why have you passed over your own injuries, involved as they were in the\n public injury? Ought you not to have brought the cause before the senate? to have\n complained of such atrocious injuries? to have taken care that those men who had\n excited the populace should be summoned by the letters of the consuls? \n ",
                "84":"\n Lately, when Marcus Aurelius Scaurus made the demand, because he said that he as\n quaestor had been prevented by force at Ephesus from taking his servant out of the temple of Diana, who had\n taken refuge in that asylum, Pericles, an Ephesian, a most noble man, was summoned\n to Rome , because he was accused of having\n been the author of that wrong. If you had stated to the senate that you, a\n lieutenant, had been so treated at Lampsacus , that your companions were wounded, your lictor slain, you\n yourself surrounded and nearly burnt, and that the ringleaders and principal actors\n and chiefs in that transaction were Themistagoras and Thessalus, who, you write,\n were so, who would not have been moved? Who would not have thought that he was\n taking care of himself in chastising the injury which had been done to you? Who\n would not have thought that not only your cause but that the common safety was at\n stake in that matter? In truth the name of lieutenant ought to be\n such as to pass in safety not only among the laws of allies, but even amid the arms\n of enemies. \n ",
                "85":"\n This crime committed at Lampsacus is very\n great; a crime of lust and of the most infamous desires. Listen now to a tale of\n avarice, but little less iniquitous of its sort. He demanded of the Milesians a ship\n to attend him to Myndus as a guard. They\n immediately gave him a light vessel, a beautiful one of its class, splendidly\n adorned and armed. With this guard he went to Myndus . For, as to the wool being public property which he carried\n off from the Milesians,—as for his extravagance on his arrival,—as for his insults\n and injuries offered to the Milesian magistrates, although they might be stated not\n only truly, but also with vehemence and with indignation, still I shall pass them\n all over, and reserve them for another time to be proved by evidence. At present\n listen to this which cannot possibly be suppressed, and at the same time cannot be\n mentioned with proper dignity. \n ",
                "86":"\n He orders the soldiers and the crew to return from Myndus to Miletus on\n foot; he himself sold that beautiful light vessel, picked out of the ten ships of\n the Milesians, to Lucius Magius and Lucius Rabius, who were living at Myndus . These are the men whom the senate lately\n voted should be considered in the number of enemies. In this vessel they sailed to\n all the enemies of the Roman people, from Dianium , which is in Spain ,\n to Senope, which is in Pontus . O ye\n immortal gods! the incredible avarice, the unheard-of audacity of such a proceeding!\n Did you dare to sell a ship of the Roman fleet, which the city of Miletus had assigned to you to attend upon you?\n If the magnitude of the crime, if the opinion of men, had no influence on you, did\n this, too, never occur to you,—that so illustrious and so noble a city would he a\n witness against you of this most wicked theft, or rather of this most abominable\n robbery? \n ",
                "87":"\n Or because at that time Cnaeus Dolabella attempted, at your request, to punish the\n man who had been in command of that vessel, and who had reported to the Milesians\n what had been done, and had ordered his report, which according to their laws had\n been inserted in the public registers, to be erased, did you, on that account, fancy\n that you had escaped from that accusation? That opinion of yours has much deceived you, and on\n many occasions. For you have always fancied, and especially in Sicily , that you had taken sufficient precautions\n for your defence, when you had either forbidden anything to be mentioned in the\n public records, or had compelled that which had been so mentioned to be erased. How\n vain that step is, although in the former pleading you learnt it in the instance of\n many cities of Sicily , yet you may learn it\n again in the case of this city. The citizens are, indeed, obedient to the command,\n as long as they are present who give the command. As soon as they are gone, they not\n only set down that which they have been forbidden to set down, but they also write\n down the reason why it was not entered in the public records at the time. \n ",
                "88":"\n Those documents remain at Miletus ,\n and will remain as long as that city lasts. For the Milesian people had built ten\n ships by command of Lucius Marcus out of the taxes imposed by the Roman people, as\n the other cities of Asia had done, each in\n proportion to its amount of taxation Wherefore they entered on their public records,\n that one of the ten had been lost, not by the sudden attack of pirates, but by the\n robbery of a lieutenant,—not by the violence of a storm, but by this horrible\n tempest which fell upon the allies. \n ",
                "89":"\n There are at Rome Milesian ambassadors, most noble men and the chief men of the\n city, who, although they are waiting with apprehension for the month of February\n and the time\n of the consuls elect, yet they not only do not dare to deny such an atrocious action\n when they are asked about it, but they cannot forbear speaking of it unasked if they\n are present. They will tell you, I say, being induced by regard to religion, and by\n their fear of their laws at home, what has become of that vessel. They will declare\n to you that Caius Verres has behaved himself like a most infamous pirate in regard\n to that fleet which was built against pirates. When Caius Malleolus, the quaestor of Dolabella, had\n been slain, he thought that two inheritances had come to him; one, that of his\n quaestorian office, for he was immediately desired by Dolabella to be his\n proquaestor; the other, of a guardianship, for as he was appointed guardian of the\n young Malleolus, he immediately invaded his property. \n ",
                "90":"\n For Malleolus had started for his province so splendidly equipped that he left\n actually nothing behind him at home. Besides, he had put out a great deal of money\n among the provincials, and had taken bills from them. He had taken with him a great\n quantity of admirably embossed silver plate. For he, too, was a companion of that\n fellow Verres in that disease and in that covetousness; and so he left behind him at\n his death a great quantity of silver plate, a great household of slaves, many\n workmen, many beautiful youths. That fellow seized all the plate that took his\n fancy; carried off all the slaves he chose; carried off the wines and all the other\n things which are procured most easily in Asia , which he had left behind: the rest he sold, and took the money\n himself. \n ",
                "91":"\n Though it was plain that he had received two million, five hundred thousand\n sesterces , when he returned to Rome , he rendered no account to his ward, none to\n his ward's mother, none to his fellow-guardians; though he had the servants of his\n ward, who were workmen, at home, and beautiful and accomplished slaves about him, he\n said that they were his own,—that he had bought them. When the mother and\n grandmother of the boy repeatedly asked him if he would neither restore the mosey\n nor render an account, at least to say how much money of Malleolus's he had\n received, being wearied with their importunities, at last he said, a million of\n sesterces . Then on the last line of his accounts,\n he put in a name at the bottom by a most shameless erasure; he put down that he had\n paid to Chrysogonus, a slave, six hundred thousand sesterces which he had received for his ward Malleolus. How out of a\n million they became six hundred thousand; how the six hundred thousand tallied so\n exactly with other accounts,—that of the money belonging to Cnaeus Carbo there was\n also a remainder of six hundred thousand sesterces ;\n and how it was that they were put down as paid to Chrysogonus; why that name\n occurred on the bottom line of the page, and after an erasure, you will judge. \n ",
                "92":"\n Yet, though he had entered in his accounts six hundred thousand sesterces as having been received, he has never paid over\n fifty thousand. Of the slaves, since he has been prosecuted in this manner, some\n have been restored, some are detained even now. All the gains which they had made,\n and all their substitutes are detained. This is that fellow's splendid\n guardianship. See to whom you are entrusting your children! Behold how great is the\n recollection of a dead companion! Behold how great is the fear of the opinion of the\n living! When all Asia had given herself up\n to you to be harassed and plundered, when all Pamphylia was placed at your mercy to be pillaged, were you not\n content with this rich booty? Could you not keep your hands off your guardianship,\n off your ward, off the son of your comrade? It is not now the Sicilians; they are\n now a set of ploughmen, as you are constantly saying, who are hemming you in. It is\n not the men who have been excited against you and rendered hostile to you by your\n own decrees and edicts. Malleolus is brought forward by me and his mother and his\n grandmother, who, unfortunate, and weeping, say that their boy has been stripped by\n you of his father's property. \n ",
                "93":"\n What are you waiting for? till poor Malleolus rises from the shades below, and\n demands of you an account of your discharge of the duties of a guardian, of a\n comrade, of an intimate friend? Fancy that he is present himself, O most avaricious\n and most licentious man, restore the property of your comrade to his son; if not all\n you have robbed him of, at least that which you have confessed that you received.\n Why do you compel the son of your comrade to utter his first words in the forum with\n the voice of indignation and complaint? Why do you compel the wife of your comrade,\n the mother-in-law of your comrade, in short, the whole family of your dead comrade,\n to hear evidence against you? Why do you compel most modest and admirable women to\n come against their wont and against their will into so great an assembly of men?\n Recite the evidence of them all.

                "96":"\n Therefore Marcus Scaurus, who accused Cnaeus Dolabella, held him under his power\n and in subjection. Being a young man, when in prosecuting his inquiries he\n ascertained the numerous robberies and iniquities of that man, he acted skillfully\n and warily.

I rejected the voluntary offers of\n all of them. There was not only no room for a traitor, there was none even for a\n deserter in my camp. Perhaps they are to be considered better accusers than I, who\n do all these things; but I wish the defender of others to be praised in my person,\n not the accuser. He does not dare bring in his accounts to the treasury before\n Dolabella is condemned. He prevails on the senate to grant him an adjournment;\n because he said that his account-books had been sealed up by the accusers of\n Dolabella; just as if he had not the power of copying them. This man is the only man\n who never renders accounts to the treasury. You have heard the accounts of his quaestorship\n rendered in three lines; but no accounts of his lieutenancy, till he was condemned\n and banished who alone could detect any error in them. The accounts of his\n praetorship, which, according to the decree of the senate, he ought to have rendered\n immediately on leaving office, he has not rendered to this very day. \n ",

He said that Dolabella obtained the same permission. The omen pleased the\n conscript fathers rather than the excuse; they admitted it. But now the quaestors\n have arrived some time. Why have you not rendered them now? Among the accounts of\n that infamous lieutenancy and pro-quaestorship of yours, those items occur which are\n necessarily set down also in the accounts of Dolabella.

The sum\n which Dolabella made out that Verres received less than he has put down in his\n account-books, is two hundred and thirty-two thousand sesterces . Dolabella also made out that on account of corn he had\n received one million and eight hundred thousand sesterces ; as to which you, O most incorruptible man, had quite a\n different entry in your account-books. Hence it is that those extraordinary gains of\n yours have accumulated, which we are examining into without any guide, article by\n article as we can;—hence the account with Quintus and Cnaeus Postumus Curtius, made\n up of many items; of which that fellow has not one in his account-books;—hence the\n fourteen hundred thousand sesterces paid to Publius\n Tadius at Athens , as I will prove by\n witnesses;—hence the praetorship, openly purchased; unless indeed that also is\n doubtful, how that man became praetor. \n ",

He, on a sudden, the moment he came to\n Rome , is made praetor for nothing!\n Besides that, other money was paid to buy off accusations.

In dealing with which, I do not doubt that I may not\n be able to avoid and escape from some blame on the ground of negligence. For many\n will say, “He said nothing of the transaction at which I was present; he never\n touched upon that injury which was done to me, or to my friend, transactions at\n which I was present.” To all those who are acquainted with the wrongs this man has\n done—that is, to the whole Roman people—I earnestly wish to make this excuse, that\n it will not be out of carelessness that I shall pass over many things, but because I\n wish to reserve some points till I produce the witnesses, and because I think it\n necessary to omit some altogether with a view to brevity, and to the time my speech\n must take. I will confess too, though against my will, that, as he never allowed any\n moment of time to pass free from crime, I have not been able to ascertain fully\n every iniquity which has been committed by him. Therefore I beg you to listen to me\n with respect to the crimes of his praetorship, expecting only to hear those\n mentioned, both in the matters of deciding law-suits and of insisting on the repair\n of public buildings, which are thoroughly worthy of a criminal whom it is not worth\n while to accuse of any small or ordinary offences. \n ",
                "103":"\n For when he was made praetor, leaving the house of Chelidon after having taken the\n auspices, he drew the lot of the city province, more in accordance with his own\n inclination and that of Chelidon, than with the wish of the Roman people. And\n observe how he behaved at the very outset,—what his intentions were as shown in his first edict. Publius Annius Asellus died while Caius\n Sacerdos was praetor. As he had an only daughter, and as he was not included in the\n census, he did what\n nature prompted, and what no law forbade,—he appointed his daughter heiress of all\n his property. His daughter was his heiress. Everything made for the orphan; the\n equity of the law, the wish of the father, the edicts of the praetors, the usage of\n the law which existed at the time that Asellus died. \n ",

To the one the property appeared desirable, the other thought that he could\n sell it. Verres, although he is of singular audacity, still sent privately to the\n young girl's mother; he preferred taking money for not issuing any new edict, to\n interposing so shameful and inhuman a decree. \n ",
                "105":"\n Her guardians, if they gave money to the praetor in the name of their ward,\n especially if it were a huge sum, did not see how they could enter it in their\n accounts; did not see how they could give it except at their own risk; and at the\n same time they did not believe that he would be so wicked. Being often applied to,\n they refused. I pray you, take notice, how equitable a decree he issued at the will\n of the man to whom he was giving the inheritance of which the children were robbed.\n “As I understand that the Lex Voconia ... ” Who\n would ever believe that Verres would be an adversary of women? or did he do\n something contrary to the interests of women, in order that the whole edict might\n not appear to have been drawn up at the will of Chelidon. He wishes, he says, to\n oppose the covetousness of men. Oh, certainly. Who, not only in the present age, but\n even in the times of our ancestors, was ever so far removed from covetousness?\n Recite what comes next, I beg; for the gravity of the man, his knowledge of the law,\n and his authority delight me. “Who, since the censorship of Aulus Postumius and\n Quintus Fulvius, has made, or shall have made....” Has made, or shall have made! who\n ever issued an edict in such a manner? \n ",
                "106":"\n Who ever proposed by an edict any penalty or danger for an act which could not be\n provided for otherwise either before the edict or after the edict? Publius Annius had made his will in\n accordance with law, with the statutes, with the authority of all who were\n consulted; a will neither improper, nor made in disregard of any duty, nor contrary\n to human nature. But even if he had made such a will as that, still, after his death\n no new law ought to have been enacted which should have any effect on his will. I\n suppose the Voconian law pleased you greatly? You should have imitated Quintus\n Voconius himself, who did not by his law take away her inheritance from any female\n whether virgin or matron, but established a law for the future, that no one who\n after the year of the existing censors should be enrolled in the census, should make\n either virgin or matron his heir. \n ",
                "107":"\n In the Voconian law, there is no “has made or shall have made.” Nor in any law is\n time past ever implicated in blame, except in cases which are of their own nature\n wicked and nefarious, so that, even if there were no law, they would be strenuously\n to be avoided. And in these cases we see that many things are established by law in\n such a way that things done previously cannot be called in question—the Cornelian\n law the law about testaments, the law about money, and many others, in which no new\n law is established in the nation, but it is established that what has always been an\n evil action shall be liable to public prosecution up to a certain time. \n ",
                "108":"\n But if any one establishes any new regulation on any points of civil law, does he\n allow everything which has been previously done to remain unaltered? Look at the\n Atinian law, at the Furian law, at the Voconian law itself, as I said before; in\n short, at every law on the subject of civil rights; you will find in all of them\n that regulations are established which are only to come into operation after the\n passing of the law. Those who attribute the greatest importance to the edict, say\n that the edict of the praetor is an annual law. You embrace more in an edict than\n you can in a law. If the first of January puts an end to the edict of the praetor,\n why does not the edict have its birth also on the first of January? Or, is it the\n case that no one can advance forward by his edict into the year when another man is\n to be praetor, but that he may retire back into the year when another man has been\n praetor? And if you had published this edict for the sake of right, and not for the\n sake of one man, you would have composed it more carefully. \n ",

Suppose a man has bequeathed in legacies more than comes to his heir or\n heirs, as by the Voconian law a man may do who is not included in the census? Why do\n you not guard against this, as it comes under the same class? Because in your\n expressions you are not thinking of the interests of a class, but of an individual;\n so that it is perfectly evident that you were influenced by a desire for money. And\n if you had issued this edict with only a prospective operation, it would have been\n less iniquitous; still it would have been scandalous: but in that case, though it\n might have been blamed, it could not have been doubted about, for no one would have\n broken it.

For after your\n praetorship many people made wills in the same manner, and among them Annia did so\n lately. She, by the advice of many of her relations, being a wealthy woman, because\n she was not included in the census, by her will made her daughter her heiress. This,\n now, is great proof of men's opinion of the singular wickedness of that fellow,\n that, though Verres had established this of his own accord, yet no one was\n apprehensive that any one could be found to adopt the rule which he had laid down.\n For you alone were found to be a man who could not be satisfied with correcting the\n wills of the living, unless you also rescinded those of the dead. \n ",

Shall the praetor be able, when we are dead, to take away\n our property and our fortunes from those to whom we give them while alive? He says,\n “I will neither give any right of petition, nor possession.” Will you, then, take\n away from a young girl her purple-bordered robe? Will you take away, not only the\n ornaments of her fortune, but those also denoting her noble birth? Do we marvel that\n the citizens of Lampsacus flew to arms\n against that man? Do we marvel that when he was leaving his province, he fled\n secretly from Syracuse as if we were\n as indignant at what happens to others as at our own injury there would not be a\n relic of that man left to appear in the forum. \n ",
                "113":"\n The father gives to his daughter: you forbid it. The laws allow it: yet you\n interpose your authority.

Forbid it if you can; if you can find any one to listen to you;\n if any one can possibly obey your order. Will you take away their will from the\n dead,—their property from the living,—their rights from all men? Would not the Roman\n people have avenged itself by force if it had not reserved you for this occasion and\n for this trial? Since the establishment of the praetorian power, we have always\n adopted this principle,—that if no will was produced, then possession was given to\n that person who would have had the best right to be the heir, if the deceased had\n died intestate. Why this is the most righteous principle it is easy to show; but in\n a matter so established by precedent it is sufficient to point out that all men had\n previously laid down the law in this way, and that this was the ancient and\n customary edict. \n ",

The genius\n of the man is marvellous; his prudence is marvellous. A man of the name of Minucius\n died while he was praetor. He left no will. By law his inheritance passed to the\n Minucian family. If Verres had issued the edict which all praetors both before and\n after him did issue, possession would have been given to the Minucian family. If any\n thought himself heir by will, though no will was known, he might proceed by law to\n put forward his claim to the inheritance; or if he had taken security for the claim,\n and given security, he then proceeded to try an action for his inheritance. This is\n the law which, as I imagine, both our ancestors and we ourselves have always been\n accustomed to. See, now, how that fellow amended it. \n ",

Is not this the point which ought to be inquired into, who\n ought to be the possessor? Therefore, because he is in possession, you do not remove\n him from the possession. If he were not in possession, you would not give him\n possession. For you nowhere say so; nor do you embrace anything else in your edict\n except that cause for which you had received money. What follows is ridiculous. \n ",

What, then, is the\n difference whether testamentary papers are produced or not? If he produces them,\n though they may have only one seal less than is required by law, you will not give\n him possession; but if he produces no such papers at all, you will. What shall I say\n now? That no one else ever issued a similar edict afterwards? A very marvellous\n thing, truly, that there should have been no one who chose to be considered like\n that fellow! He himself, in his Sicilian edict, has not this passage. No; for he had\n received his payment for it. And so in the edict which I have mentioned before,\n which he issued in Sicily , about giving\n possession of inheritances, he laid down the same rules which all the praetors at\n Rome had laid down besides himself. From\n the Sicilian edict,—“If any doubt arise about an inheritance...” \n ",

Did you think those men who were living in the province more\n worthy to enjoy just laws than we were? Or is one thing just in Rome and another in Sicily ? For you cannot say in this place that there are many things\n in the province which require to be regulated differently from what they would if\n they existed at Rome ; at all events not in\n the case of taking possession of inheritances, or of the inheritances of women. For\n in both these cases I see that nor only all other magistrates, but that you\n yourself, have issued edicts word for word the same as those which are accustomed to\n be issued at Rome . The clauses which, with\n great disgrace and for a great bribe, you had inserted in your edict at Rome , those alone, I see, you omitted in your\n Sicilian edict, in order not to incur odium in the province for nothing. \n ",

Therefore, Lucius Piso filled many books with the affairs in\n which he had interposed his authority, because Verres had decreed in a manner\n contrary to his edict. And I think that you have not forgotten what a multitude and\n what respectable citizens used to assemble before Piso's seat while that man was\n praetor, and unless he had had him for a colleague, he would have been stoned in the\n very forum.

Publius Trebonius made many virtuous and honourable men his heirs; and\n among them his own freedman. He had had a brother, Aulus Trebonius, a proscribed\n man. As he wished to make provision for him, he put down in his will, that his heirs\n should take an oath to manage that not less than half of each man's share should\n come to Aulus Trebonius, that proscribed brother of his. The freedman takes the\n oath; the other heirs go to Verres, and point out to him that they ought not to take\n such an oath; that they should be doing what was contrary to the Cornelian law, which forbids a proscribed man to be\n assisted. They obtain from him authority to refuse the oath. He gives them\n possession; that I do not find fault with. Certainly it was a scandalous thing for\n any part of his brother's property to be given to a man who was proscribed and in\n want. But that freedman thought that he should be committing a wickedness if he did\n not take the oath in obedience to the will of his patron. \n ",

You give possession to him who did not take the oath. I admit your right to\n do so; it is a privilege of the praetor. You take it from him who has taken the\n oath. According to what precedent? He is aiding a proscribed man. There is a law;\n there is a punishment established in such a case. What is that to him who is\n determining the law? Do you blame him because he assisted his patron, who was in\n distress at the time, or because he attended to the wishes of his other patron, who\n was dead, from whom he had received the greatest of all benefits? Which of these\n actions are you blaming? And then that most admirable man, sitting on his curule\n chair, said this: “Can a freedman be heir to a Roman knight of such great wealth?” O\n how modest must the class of freedmen be, since he departed from that place alive!\n \n ",

He died while Caius Sacerdos was praetor.\n I don't know whether it was not before Verres had begun to announce himself as a\n candidate for the praetorship. He made Marcus Octavius Ligur his heir. Ligur thus\n entered upon his inheritance; he took possession while Sacerdos was praetor, without\n any dispute. After Verres entered on his office, in accordance with his edict, an\n edict such as Sacerdos had not issued, the daughter of the patron of Sulpicius began\n to claim from Ligur a sixth part of the inheritance. Ligur was absent. His brother\n Lucius conducted his cause; his friends\n and relations were present. That fellow Verres said that, unless the business was\n settled with the woman, he should order her to take possession. Lucius Gellius\n defended the cause of Ligur. He showed that his edict ought not to prevail with\n respect to those inheritances which had accrued to the heirs before his praetorship;\n that, if this edict had existed at that time, perhaps Ligur would not have entered\n upon the inheritance at all. This just demand, and the highest authority of\n influential men, was beaten down by money. \n ",

At last he began to\n entreat him not to despise his influence and scorn his authority to such an extent\n as to inflict such an injury upon him. The fellow began to accuse Ligur of being so\n assiduous and so attentive in a business which was adventitious, and only belonging\n to him by way of inheritance. He said that he ought to have a regard for him also;\n that he required a great deal himself; that the dogs whom he kept about him required\n a great deal.

What is there, O Verres which can ever be made plain by\n witnesses, if this is not made so? Or is that which they relate a small thing? It is\n nothing less than the praetor of the city establishing this law as long as he\n remains in office,—that the praetor ought to be co-heir with all those to whom an\n inheritance comes.

And after this power was\n conferred on him, that man, as you have learnt from Caius Fannius and from Quintus\n Tadius, as he had committed his robberies in every sort of affair without the least\n disguise and with the greatest effrontery, wished to leave this as a most visible\n record of his robberies, which we might, not occasionally hear of, but see every day\n of our lives. \n ",

When he said,\n as was the case, that the delivery of the temple had been very easy for his ward;\n that all the statues and presents were in their places, that the temple itself was\n sound in every part; that fellow began to think it a shameful thing if he was to\n give up so large a temple and so extensive a work without enriching himself by\n booty, and especially by booty to be got from a minor. \n ",

Verres orders\n Rabonius to be quiet, and at the same time holds out to him some hopes of a\n partnership with himself in the business.

They report the business to a\n man of the greatest consideration, of the greatest benevolence and virtue, Marcus\n Marcellus, who was also a guardian of the minor. Marcus Marcellus comes to Verres;\n he begs of him with many arguments, in the name of his own good faith and diligence\n in his office, not to endeavour to deprive\n Junius his ward of his father's fortune by\n the greatest injustice.

So\n great was the modesty of that most eminent young man, of that pattern for the youth\n of the city, that for some time, though he was pressed by me on that point, he would\n rather give any answer than mention the name of Chelidon.

They settle the business, which ought to have\n come to scarcely forty thousand sesterces , with\n Rabonius the other guardian, for two hundred thousand. Rabonius reports the fact to\n Verres; as it seems to him the exaction has been sufficiently enormous and\n sufficiently shameless.

Therefore\n Rabonius gives notice to the guardians that he renounces the settlement to which he\n had come. However, the guardians come at the appointed time; Junius, the uncle of\n the youth, bids. Verres began to change colour: his countenance, his speech, his\n resolution failed him. He begins to consider what he was to do. If the contract was\n taken by the minor, if the affair slipped through the fingers of the purchaser whom\n he himself had provided, he would get no plunder. Therefore He contrives—what?\n Nothing very cleverly, nothing of which any one could say, “it was a rascally trick,\n but still a deep one.” Do not expect any disguised roguery from him, any underhand\n trick; you will find everything open, undisguised, shameless, senseless, audacious.\n \n ",

He excludes that bidder alone to whom alone, I was nearly saying,\n the power of taking the contract ought to have been offered. “For why,”—so the youth\n might say—“should any one aspire to my money against my will! What does he come\n forward for? The contract is let out for a work which is to be done and paid for out\n of my money. I say that it is I who am going to put the place in repair, the\n inspection of it afterwards will belong to you who let out the contract. You have\n taken sufficient security for the interests of the people with bonds and sureties;\n and if you do not think sufficient security has been taken, will you as praetor send\n whomsoever you please to take possession of my property, and not permit me to come\n forward in defence of my own fortune?” \n ",

You will say that\n the same man drew it up who drew up that edict about inheritance. “The contract for\n work to be done, which the minor Junius's....” Speak, I pray you, a little more\n plainly. “Caius Verres, the praetor of the city, has added....” The contracts of the\n censors are being amended. For what do they say? I see in many old documents,\n “Cnaeus Domitius, Lucius Metellus, Lucius Cassius, Cnaeus Servilius have added....”\n Caius Verres wants something of the same sort. Read. What has he added? “Admit not\n as a partner in this work any one who has taken a contract from Lucius Marcius and\n Marcus Perperna the censors; give him no snare in it; and let him not contract for\n it.” Why so? Is it that the work may not be faulty? But the inspection afterwards\n belonged to you. Lest he should not have capital enough? But sufficient security had\n been taken for the people's interest in bonds and sureties, and more security still\n might have been had. \n ",
                "143":"\n If in this case the business itself, if the scandalous nature of your injustice\n had no weight with you;—if the misfortune of this minor, the tears of his relations,\n the peril of Decimus Brutus, whose lands were pledged as security for him, and the\n authority of Marcus Marcellus his guardian had no influence with you, did you not\n even consider this, that your crime would be such that you would neither be able to\n deny it, (for you had entered it in your account-books,) nor, if you confessed it,\n to make any excuse for it? The contract is knocked down at five hundred and fifty\n thousand sesterces , while the guardians kept crying\n out that they could do it even to the satisfaction of the most unjust of men, for\n eighty thousand. In truth, what was the job? \n ",
                "144":"\n That which you saw. All those pillars which you see whitewashed, had a crane put\n against them, were taken down at a very little expense, and put up again of the same\n stone as before. And you let this work out for five hundred and sixty thousand\n sesterces . And among those pillars I say that\n there are some which have never been moved at all by your contractor. I say that\n there are some which only had the outer coat scraped off, and a fresh coat put on.\n But, if I had thought that it cost so much to whitewash pillars, I should certainly\n never have stood for the aedileship. Still, in order that something might appear to\n be really being done, and that it might not seem to be a mere robbery of a minor—“If\n in the course of the work you injure anything, you must repair it.” \n ",
                "145":"\n What was there that he could injure, when he was only putting back every stone in\n its place? “He who takes the contract must give security to bear the man harmless\n who has taken the work from the former contractor.” He is joking when he orders\n Rabonius to give himself security. “Ready money is to be paid.” Out of what funds?\n From his funds who cried out that he would do for eighty thousand sesterces what you let out at five hundred and sixty\n thousand. Out of what funds? out of the funds of a minor, whose tender age and\n desolate condition, even if he had no guardians, the praetor himself ought to\n protect. But as his guardians did protect him, you took away not only his paternal\n fortune, but the property of the guardians also. \n ",
                "146":"\n “Execute the work in the best materials of every sort.” Was any stone to be cut\n and brought to the place? Nothing was to be brought but the crane. For no stone, no\n materials at all were brought; there was just as much to be done in that contract as\n took a little labour of artisans at low wages, and there was the hire of the crane.\n Do you think it was less work to make one entirely new pillar without any old stone,\n which could be worked up again, or to put back those four in their places? No one\n doubts that it is a much a better job to make one new one. I will prove that in\n private houses, where there has been a great deal of expensive carriage, pillars no\n smaller than these are contracted for to be placed in an open court for forty\n thousand sesterces apiece. \n ",
                "147":"\n But it is folly to argue about such manifest shamelessness of that man at any\n greater length, especially when in the whole contract he has openly disregarded the\n language and opinion of every one, inasmuch as he has added at the bottom of it,\n “Let him have the old materials for himself.” As if any old materials were taken\n from that work, and as if the whole work were not done with old materials. But\n still, if the minor was not allowed to take the contract, it was not necessary for\n it to come to Verres himself: some other of the citizens might have undertaken the\n work. Every one else was excluded no less openly than the minor. He appointed a day\n by which the work must be completed—the first of December. He gives out the contract\n about the thirteenth of September: every one is excluded by the shortness of the\n time. What happens then? How does Rabonius contrive to have his work done by that\n day? \n ",
                "148":"\n No one troubles Rabonius, neither on the first of December, nor on the fifth, nor\n on the thirteenth. At last Verres himself goes away to his province some time before\n the work is completed. After he was prosecuted, at first he said that he could not\n enter the work in his accounts; when Rabonius pressed it, he attributed the cause of\n it to me, because I had sealed up his books. Rabonius applies to me, and sends his\n friends to apply to me; he easily gets what he wishes for; Verres did not know what\n he was to do. By not having entered it in his accounts, he thought he should be able\n to make some defence; but he felt sure that Rabonius would reveal the whole of the\n transaction. Although, what could be more plain than it now is, even without the\n evidence of any witness whatever. At last he enters the work in Rabonius's name as\n undertaken by him, four years after the day which he had fixed for its completion.\n \n ",
                "149":"\n He would never have allowed such terms as those if any other citizen had been the\n contractor; when he had shut out all the other contractors by the early day which he\n had fixed, and also because men did not choose to put themselves in the power of a\n man who, if they took the contract, thought that his plunder was torn from his\n hands. For why need we discuss the point where the money went to? He himself has\n showed us. First of all, when Decimus Brutus contended eagerly against him, who paid\n five hundred and sixty thousand sesterces of his\n own money; and as he could not resist him, though he had given out the job, and\n taken securities for its execution, he returned him a hundred and ten thousand. Now\n if this had been another man's money, he clearly could not have done so. In the\n second place, the money was paid to Cornificius, whom he cannot deny to have been\n his secretary. Lastly, the accounts of Rabonius himself cry out loudly that the\n plunder was Verres's own. Read “The items of the accounts of Rabonius.” \n ",

Therefore, O Hortensius, it was not his age but his cause, not his dress but\n his fortune, that seemed to you calculated to rouse the popular feeling. Nor did it\n move you so much that he had come with the praetexta, as that he had come without\n the bulla . For\n no one was influenced by that dress which custom and the right of his free birth\n allowed him to wear.

We, while alive, ought to take care and provide that their\n desolate condition and childhood may be secured by the strongest possible\n protection. For who is there who can defend the childhood of our children against\n the dishonesty of magistrates? Their mother, I suppose.

And if I were to wish to say anything of that decision, I should\n have to call in question and to attack many people, which it is not necessary for me\n to do.

But what plunder he\n amassed in selling the property of Quintus Opimius, and how openly, how scandalously\n he amassed it, it would take too long to relate now.

And\n before I begin to speak of the distresses of Sicily , it seems to me that I ought to say a little of the dignity\n and antiquity of that province, and of the advantage which it is to us. For as you\n ought to have a careful regard for all the allies and provinces, so especially ought\n you to have a regard for Sicily , O judges,\n for many, and those the greatest, reasons:—First, because of all foreign nations\n Sicily was the first who joined herself\n to the friendship and alliance of the Roman people. She was the first to be called a\n province; and the provinces are a great ornament to the empire. She was the first\n who taught our ancestors how glorious a thing it was to rule over foreign nations.\n She alone has displayed such good faith and such good will towards the Roman people,\n that the states of that island which have once come into our alliance have never\n revolted afterwards, but many of them, and those the most illustrious of them, have\n remained firm to our friendship for ever. \n ",
                "2":"\n Therefore our ancestors made their first strides to dominion over Africa from this province. Nor would the mighty\n power of Carthage so soon have fallen,\n if Sicily had not been open to us, both as\n a granary to supply us with corn, and as a harbour for our fleets. Wherefore, Publius Africanus, when he had\n destroyed Carthage , adorned the cities\n of the Sicilians with most beautiful statues and monuments, in order to place the\n greatest number of monuments of his victory among those whom he thought were\n especially delighted at the victory of the Roman people. \n ",
                "3":"\n Afterwards that illustrious man, Marcus Marcellus himself, whose valour in\n Sicily was felt by his enemies, his mercy\n by the conquered, and his good faith by all the Sicilians, not only provided in that\n war for the advantage of his allies, but spared even his conquered enemies. When by\n valour and skill he had taken Syracuse , that most beautiful city, which was not only strongly\n fortified by art, but was protected also by its natural advantages—by the character\n of the ground about it, and by the sea—he not only allowed it to remain without any\n diminution of its strength, but he left it so highly adorned, as to be at the same\n time a monument of his victory, of his clemency, and of his moderation; when men saw\n both what he had subdued, and whom he had spared, and what he had left behind him.\n He thought that Sicily was entitled to have\n so much honour paid to her, that he did not think that he ought to destroy even an\n enemy's city in an island of such allies. \n ",
                "4":"\n And therefore we have always so esteemed the island of Sicily for every purpose, as to think that whatever\n she could produce was not so much raised among the Sicilians as stored up in our own\n homes. When did she not deliver the corn which she was bound to deliver, by the\n proper day? When did she fail to promise us, of her own accord, whatever she thought\n we stood in need of? When did she ever refuse anything which was exacted of her?\n Therefore that illustrious Marcus Cato the wise called Sicily a storehouse of provisions for our republic—the nurse of the\n Roman people. But we experienced, in that long and difficult Italian war which we\n encountered, that Sicily was not only a\n storehouse of provisions to us, but was also an old and well-filled treasury left us\n by our ancestors; for, supplying us with hides, with tunics, and with corn, it\n clothed, armed, and fed our most numerous armies, without any expense at all to\n us. \n ",

There is\n nothing then like the rest of the Greeks; no sloth, no luxury; on the contrary there\n is the greatest diligence in all public and private affairs, the greatest economy,\n and the greatest vigilance.

Afterwards, too, they experienced that\n terrible government of Marcus Antonius.

For I shall consult\n their safety rather than their inclination. Do you think that there was ever any\n criminal in any province defended in his absence against the inquiry into his\n conduct urged by his accuser, with such influence, and with such zeal?

They began to threaten the\n Sicilians, if they decreed any deputations to make statements against him; to\n threaten any one who had gone on any such deputation, to make most liberal promises\n to others, if they spoke well of him; to detain by force and under guard the most\n damaging witnesses of his private transactions, whom we had summoned by word of\n mouth to give evidence. \n ",

Indeed, who could doubt, when they recollected\n his flight and robbery in his quaestorship—when they considered his spoliation of\n temples and shrines in his lieutenancy—when they saw in the forum the plunder of his\n praetorship—what sort of man he was likely to prove in the fourth act of his\n villainy? And that you may\n be aware that he inquired at Rome not only\n into the different kinds of robbery which he might be able to execute, but into the\n very names of his victims, listen to this most certain proof, by which you will be\n able more easily to form an opinion of his unexampled impudence. \n ",
                "18":"\n The very day on which he reached Sicily ,\n (see now whether he was not come, according to that omen bruited about the city,)\n prepared to sweep the province pretty clean, he immediately sends letters from\n Messana to Halesa, which I suppose he had\n written in Italy . For, as soon as he\n disembarked from the ship, he gave orders that Dio of Halesa should come to him\n instantly; saying that he wished to make inquiry about an inheritance which had come\n to his son from a relation, Apollodorus Laphiro. \n ",
                "19":"\n It was, O judges, a very large sum of money. This Dio, O judges, is now, by the\n kindness of Quintus Metellus, become a Roman citizen; and in his case it was proved\n to your satisfaction at the former pleading, by the evidence of many men of the\n highest consideration, and by the account-books of many men, that a million of\n sesterces had been paid in order that, after\n Verres had inquired into the cause, in which there could no possible doubt exist, he\n might have a decision in his favour;—that, besides that all herds of the\n highest-bred mares were driven away, that all the plate and embroidered robes which\n he had in his home were carried off; so that Quintus Dio lost eleven hundred\n thousand sesterces because an inheritance had come\n to him, and for no other reason. \n ",
                "20":"\n What are we to say? Who was praetor when this inheritance came to the son of Dio?\n The same man who was so when hers came to Annia the daughter of Publius Annius the\n senator,—the same who was so when his was left to Marcus Ligur the senator, namely\n Caius Sacerdos. What are we to say? Had no one been troublesome to Dio on the\n subject at the time?, No more than they had to Ligur, while Sacerdos was praetor.\n What then? :Did any one make any complaint to Verres? Nobody, unless perhaps you\n suppose that the informers were ready for him at the strait. When he was still at Rome , he heard that a very great inheritance had\n come to a certain Sicilian named Dio; that the heir had been enjoined by the terms\n of the will to erect statues in the forum; that, unless he erected them, he was to\n be liable to forfeiture to Venus Erycina. Although they had been erected in\n compliance with the will, still he; Verres, thought, since the name of Venus was\n mentioned, that he could find some pretext for making money of it. \n ",
                "21":"\n Therefore he sets up a man to claim that inheritance for Venus Erycina. For it was\n not (as would have been usual) the quaestor in whose province Mount Eryx was, who\n made the demand. A fellow of the name of Naevius Turpo is the claimant, a spy and\n emissary of Verres, the most infamous of all that band of informers of his, who had\n been condemned in the praetorship of Caius Sacerdos for many wickednesses. For the\n cause was such that the very praetor himself when he was seeking for an accuser,\n could not find one a little more respectable than this fellow. Verres acquits his\n man of any forfeiture to Venus, but condemns him to pay forfeit to himself. He\n preferred, forsooth, to have men do wrong rather than gods;—he preferred himself to\n extort from Dio what was contrary to law, rather than to let Venus take anything\n that was not due to her. \n ",
                "22":"\n Why need I now in this place recite the evidence of Sextus Pompeius Chlorus, who\n pleaded Dio's cause? who was concerned in the whole business? A most honourable man,\n and, although he has long ago been made a Roman citizen in reward for his virtues,\n still the very chief man and the most noble of all the Sicilians. Why need I recite\n the evidence of Quintus Caecilius Dio himself, a most admirable and moderate man?\n Why need I recite that of Lucius Vetecilius Ligur, of Titus Manlius, of Lucius\n Calenus? by the evidence of all of whom this case about Dio's money was fully\n established. Marcus Lucullus said the same thing that he had long ago known all the\n facts of the tyranny practised on Dio, through the connection of hospitality which\n existed between them. \n ",
                "23":"\n What? Did Lucullus, who was at that time in Macedonia , know all these things better than you, O Hortensius, who\n were at Rome ? you to whom Dio fled for\n aid? you who expostulated with Verres by letter in very severe terms about the\n injuries done to Dio? Is an this new to you now, and unexpected? is this the first\n time your ears have heard of this crime?, Did you hear nothing of it from Dio,\n nothing from your own mother-in-law, that most admirable woman, Servilia, an ancient\n friend and connection of Dio's? Are not my witnesses ignorant of many circumstances\n which you are acquainted with? Is it not owing, not to the innocence of your client,\n but to the exception made by the law,\n that I am prevented from summoning you as a witness on my side on this charge? [The\n evidence of Marcus Lucullus, of Chlorus, of Dio is read.] Does not this Venereal man, who went\n forth from the bosom of Chelidon to his province, appear to you to have got a\n sufficiently large sum by means of the name of Verres? \n ",
                "24":"\n Listen now to a no less shamelessly false accusation in a case where a smaller sum\n was involved. Sosippus and Epicrates were brothers of the town of Agyrium ; their father died twenty-two years ago, by\n whose will, if anything were done wrongly in any point, there was to be a forfeiture\n of his property to Venus. In the twentieth year after his death, though there had\n been in the interim so many praetors, so many quaestors, and so many false accusers\n in the province, the inheritance was claimed from the brothers in the name of Venus.\n Verres takes cognisance of the cause; by the agency of Volcatius he receives money\n from the two brothers, about four hundred thousand sesterces . You have heard the evidence of many people already; the\n brothers of Agyrium gained their cause, but\n on such terms that they left the court stripped and beggared. \n ",
                "25":"\n Oh, but that money never came to Verres. What does that defence mean? is that\n asserted in this case, or only put out as a feeler? For to me it is quite a new\n light. Verres set up the accusers; Verres summoned the brother to appear before him;\n Verres heard the cause; Verres gave sentence. A vast sum was paid; they who paid it\n gained the cause; and you argue in defence “that money was not paid to Verres.” I\n can help you; my witnesses too say the same thing; they say they paid it to\n Volcatius. How did Volcatius acquire so much power as to get four hundred thousand\n sesterces from two men? Would any one have given\n Volcatius, if he had come on his own account, one half-farthing? Let him come now,\n let him try; no one will receive him in his house. But I say more; I accuse you of\n having received forty millions of sesterces \n contrary to law; and I deny that you have ever accounted for one farthing of that\n money; but when money was paid for your decrees, for your orders, for your\n decisions, the point to be inquired into was not into whose hand it was paid, but by\n whose oppression it was extorted. \n ",
                "26":"\n Those chosen companions of yours were your hands; the prefects, the secretaries,\n the surgeons, the attendants the soothsayers, the criers, were your hands. The more\n each individual was connected with you by any relationship, or affinity, or\n intimacy, the more he was considered one of your bands. The whole of that retinue of\n yours, which caused more evil to Sicily \n than a hundred troops of fugitive slaves would have caused, was beyond all question\n your hand. Whatever was taken by any one of these men, that must be considered not\n only as having been given to you, but as having been paid into your own hand. For if\n you, O judges, admit this defence, “He did not receive it himself,” you will put an\n end to all judicial proceedings for extortion. For no criminal will be brought\n before you so guilty as not to be able to avail himself of that plea? Indeed, since\n Verres uses it, what criminal will ever henceforward be found so abandoned as not to\n be thought equal to Quintus Lucius in innocence by comparison with that man? And\n even now those who say this do not appear to me to be defending Verres so much as\n trying, in the instance of Verres, what license of defence will be admitted in other\n cases. \n ",
                "27":"\n And with reference to this matter, you, O judges, ought to take great care what\n you do. It concerns the chief interests of the republic, and the reputation of our\n order, and the safety of the allies. For if we wish to be thought innocent, we must\n not only show that we ourselves are moderate, but that our companions are so too.\n First of all, we must\n take care to take those men with us who with regard our credit and our safety.\n Secondly, if in the selection of men our hopes have deceived us through friendship\n for the persons, we must take care to punish them, to dismiss them. We must always\n live as if we expected to have to give an account of what we have been doing. This\n is what was said by Africanus, a most kind-hearted man, (but that kind-heartedness\n alone is really admirable which is exercised without any risk to a man's reputation,\n as it was by him,) \n ",
                "28":"\n when an old follower of his, who reckoned himself one of his friends, could not\n prevail on him to take him with him into Africa as his prefect, and was much annoyed at it. “Do not marvel,”\n said he, “that you do not obtain this from me, for I have been a long time begging a\n man to whom I believe my reputation to be dear, to go with me as my prefect, and as\n yet I cannot prevail upon him.” And in truth there is much more reason to beg men to\n go with us as our officers into a province, if we wish to preserve our safety and\n our honour, than to give men office as a favour to them; but as for you, when you\n were inviting your friends into the province, as to a place for plunder, and were\n robbing in company with them, and by means of them, and were presenting them in the\n public assembly with golden rings, did it never occur to you that you should have to\n give an account, not only of yourself, but of their actions also? \n ",
                "29":"\n When he had acquired for himself these great and abundant gains from these causes\n which he had determined to examine into himself with his council—that is, with this\n retinue of his—then he invented an infinite number of expedients for getting bold of\n a countless amount of money. No one doubts that all the wealth of every man is placed in the\n power of those men who allow trials to proceed, and of those who sit as judges at the\n trials, no one doubts that none of us can retain possession of his house, of his\n farm, or of his paternal property, if, when these are claimed by any one of you, a\n rascally praetor, whose judgments no one has the power of arresting, can assign any\n judge whom he chooses, and if the worthless and corrupt judge gives any sentence\n which the praetor bids him give. \n ",
                "30":"\n But if this also be added, that the praetor assigns the trial to take place\n according to such a formula, that even Lucius Octavius Balbus, if he were judge, (a\n man of the greatest experience in all that belongs to the law and to the duties of a\n judge,) could not decide otherwise: suppose it ran in this way:—“Let Lucius Octavius\n be the judge; if it appears that the farm at Capena , which is in dispute, belongs, according to the law of the\n Roman people, to Publius Servilius, that farm must be restored to Quintus Catulus,”\n will not Lucius Octavius be bound, as judge, to compel Publius Servilius to restore\n the farm to Quintus Catulus, or to condemn him whom he ought not to condemn? The\n whole praetorian law was like that; the whole course of judicial proceedings in\n Sicily was like that for three years,\n while Verres was praetor. His decrees were like this:—“If he does not accept what\n you say that you owe, accuse him; if he claims anything, take him to prison.”\n He ordered Caius Fuficius, who claimed something, to be\n taken to prison; so he did Lucius Suetius and Lucius Rucilius. His tribunals he\n formed in this way:—those who were Roman citizens were to be judges, when Sicilians\n ought to have been, according to their laws, those who were Sicilians were to be\n judges, when Romans should have been. \n ",
                "31":"\n But that you may understand his whole system of judicial proceedings, listen first\n to the laws of the Sicilians in such uses, and then to the practices this man\n established. The\n Sicilians have this law,—that if a citizen of any town has a dispute with a\n fellow-citizen, he is to decide it in his own town, according to the laws there\n existing; if a Sicilian has a dispute with a Sicilian of a different city, in that\n case the praetor is to assign judges of that dispute, according to the law of\n Publius Rupilius, which be enacted by the advice of ten commissioners appointed to\n consider the subject, and which the Sicilians call the Rupilian law. If an\n individual makes a claim in a community, or a community on an individual, the senate\n of some third city is assigned to furnish the judges, as the citizens of the cities\n interested in the litigation are rejected as judges in such a case. If a Roman\n citizen makes a claim on a Sicilian, a Sicilian judge is assigned; if a Sicilian\n makes a claim on a Roman citizen, a Roman citizen is assigned as judge: in all other\n matters judges are appointed selected from the body of Roman citizens dwelling in\n the place. In law-suits between the farmers and the tax collectors, trials are\n regulated by the law about corn, which they call Lex\n Hieronica . \n ",
                "32":"\n All these rights were not only thrown into disorder while that man was praetor,\n but indeed were openly taken away from both the Sicilians and from the Roman\n citizens. First of all, their own laws with reference to one another were\n disregarded. If a citizen had a dispute with another citizen, he either assigned any\n one as judge whom it was convenient to himself to assign, crier, soothsayer, or his\n own physician; or if a tribunal was established by the laws, and the parties had\n come before one of their fellow-citizens as the judge, that citizen was not allowed\n to decide without control. For, listen to the edict issued by this man, by which\n edict he brought every tribunal under his own authority: “If any one had given a\n wrong decision, he would examine into the matter himself; when he had examined, he\n would punish.” And when he did that, no one doubted that when the judge thought that\n some one else was doing to sit in judgment on his decision, and that he should be at\n the risk of his life in the matter, he would consider the inclination of the man who\n he expected would presently be judging in a matter affecting his down existence as a\n citizen. \n ",
                "33":"\n Judges selected from the Roman settlers there were none; none even of the traders\n in the cities were proposed as judges. The crowd of judges which I am speaking of\n was the retinue, not of Quintus Scaevola, (who, however, did not make practice of\n appointing judges from among his own followers,) but of Caius Verres. And what sort\n of a retinue do you suppose it was when such a man as he was its chief? You see\n announced in the edict, “If the senate gives an erroneous decision....” I will prove\n that, if at any time a bench of judges was taken from the senate, that also gave its\n decisions, through compulsion, on his part, contrary to their own opinions. There\n never was any selection of the judges by lot, according to the Rupilian law, except\n when he had no interest whatever in the case. The tribunals established in the case\n of many disputes by the Lex Hieronica were all\n abolished by a single edict; no judges were appointed selected from the settlers or\n from the traders. What great power he had you see; now learn how he exercised it.\n \n ",
                "34":"\n Heraclius is the son of Hiero, a Syracusan; a man among the very first for\n nobility of family, and, before Verres came as praetor, one of the most wealthy of\n the Syracusans; now a very poor man, owing to no other calamity but the avarice and\n injustice of that man. An inheritance of at least three millions of sesterces came to him by the will of his relation\n Heraclius; the house was full of silver plate exquisitely carved, of abundance of\n embroidered robes, and of most valuable slaves; things in which who is ignorant of\n the insane cupidity of that man? The fact was a subject of common conversation, that\n a great fortune had come to Heraclius that Heraclius would not only be rich, but\n that he would be amply supplied with furniture, plate, robes and slaves. \n ",
                "35":"\n Verres, too, hears this; and at first he tries by the tricks and maneuvers which he\n is so fond of, to get him to lend things to him to look at, which he means never to\n return. Afterwards he takes counsel from some Syracusans; and they were relations of\n his, whose wives too were not believed to be entirely strangers to him, by name\n Cleomenes and Aeschrio. What influence they had with him, and on what disgraceful\n reasons it was founded, you may understand from the rest of the accusation. These\n men, as I say, give Verres advice. They tell him that the property is a fine one,\n which in every sort of wealth; and that Heraclius himself is a man advancing in\n years, and not very active; and that he has no patron on whom he has any claim, or\n to whom he has any access except the Marcelli; that a condition was contained in the\n will in which he was mentioned as heir, that he was to erect some statues in the\n palaestra. We will contrive to produce people from the palaestra to assert that they\n have not been erected according to the terms of the will, and to claim the\n inheritance, because they say that it is forfeited to the palaestra. The idea\n pleased Verres. \n ",
                "36":"\n For he foresaw that, when such an inheritance became disputed, and was claimed by\n process of law, it was quite impossible for him not to get some plunder out of it\n before it was done with. He approves of the plan; he advises them to begin to act as\n speedily as possible, and to attack a man of that age, and disinclined to law-suits,\n with as much bluster as possible. An action is brought in due form against Heraclius. At first all\n marvel at the roguery of the accusation. After a little, of those who knew Verres,\n some suspected, and some clearly saw that he had cast his eyes on the inheritance.\n In the mean time the day had arrived, on which he had announced in his edict that,\n according to established usage, and to the Rupilian law, he would assign judges at\n Syracuse . He had come prepared to\n assign judges in this cause. Then Heraclius points out to him that he cannot assign\n judges in his cause that day, because the Rupilian law said that they were not to be\n assigned till thirty days after the action was commenced. The thirty days had not\n yet elapsed; Heraclius hoped that, if he could avoid having them appointed that day,\n Quintus Arrius, whom the province was eagerly expecting, would arrive as successor\n to Verres before another appointment could take place. \n ",
                "37":"\n He postponed appointing judges in all suits, and fixed the first day for\n appointing them that he legally could after the thirty days claimed by Heraclius in\n his action had elapsed. When the day arrived, he began to pretend that he was\n desirous to appoint the judges. Heraclius comes with his advocates, and claims to be\n allowed to have the cause between him and the men of the palaestra, that is to say,\n with the Syracusan people, tried by strict law. His adversaries demand that judges\n be appointed to decide on that matter of those cities which were in the habit of\n frequenting the Syracusan courts. Judges were appointed, whomsoever Verres chose.\n Heraclius demanded, on the other hand, that judges should be appointed according to\n the provisions of the Rupilian law; and that no departure should be made from the\n established usage of their ancestors, from the authority of the senate, and from the\n rights of all the Sicilians. \n ",
                "38":"\n Why need I demonstrate the licentious wickedness of that Verres, in the\n administration of justice? Who of you is not aware of it, from his administration in\n this city? Who ever, while he was praetor, could obtain anything by law against the\n will of Chelidon? The province did not corrupt that man, as it has corrupted some;\n he was the same man that he had been at Rome . When Heraclius said, what all men well knew, that there was an\n established form of law among the Sicilians by which causes between them were to be\n tried; that there was the Rupilian law, which Publius Rupilius, the consul, had\n enacted, with the advice of ten chosen commissioners; that every praetor and consul\n in Sicily had always observed this law. He\n said that he should not appoint judges according to the provisions of the Rupilian\n law. He appointed five judges who were most agreeable to himself. \n ",
                "39":"\n What can you do with such a man as this? What punishment can you find worthy of\n such licentiousness? Then it was prescribed to you by law, O most wicked and most\n shameless man, in what way you were to appoint judges among the Sicilians; when the\n authority of a general of the Roman people, when the dignity of ten commissioners,\n men of the highest rank, when a positive resolution of the senate was against you,\n in obedience to which resolution Publius Rupilius had established laws in Sicily by the advice of ten commissioners; when,\n before you came as praetor every one had most strictly observed the Rupilian laws in\n all points, and especially in judicial matters; did you dare to consider so many\n solemn circumstances as nothing in comparison with your own plunder? Did you\n acknowledge no law? Had you no scruple? no regard for your reputation? no fear of\n any judgment yourself? Has the authority of no one of any weight with you? Was there\n no example which you chose to follow? \n ",
                "40":"\n But, I was going to say, when these five judges had been appointed, by no law,\n according to no use, with none of the proper ceremonies, with no drawing of lots,\n according to his mere will, not to examine into the cause, but to give whatever\n decision they were commanded, on that day nothing more was done; the parties are\n ordered to appear on the day following. In the meantime Heraclius, as he sees that it is all a plot laid by\n the praetor against his fortune, resolves, by the advice of his friends and\n relations, not to appear before the court. Accordingly he flies from Syracuse that night. Verres the next day, early\n in the morning,—for he had got up much earlier than he ever did before,—orders the\n judges to be summoned. When he finds that Heraclius does not appear, he begins to\n insist on their condemning Heraclius in his absence. They expostulate with him, and\n beg him, if he pleases, to adhere to the rule he had himself laid down, and not to\n compel them to decide against the absent party in favour of the party who was\n present, before the tenth hour. He agrees. \n ",
                "41":"\n In the meantime both Verres himself began to be uneasy, and his friends and\n counselors began also to be a good deal vexed at Heraclius' having fled. They\n thought that the condemnation of an absent man, especially in a matter involving so\n large a sum of money, would be a far more odious measure than if he had appeared in\n court, and had there been condemned. To this consideration was added the fact, that\n because the judges had not been appointed in accordance with the provisions of the\n Rupilian law, they saw that the affair would appear much more base and more\n iniquitous. And so, while he endeavours to correct this error, his covetousness and\n dishonesty are made more evident. For he declares that he will not use those five\n judges; he orders (as ought to have been done at first, according to the Rupilian\n law) Heraclius to be summoned, and those who had brought the action against him; he\n says that he is going to appoint the judges by lot, according to the Rupilian law.\n That which Heraclius the day before could not obtain from him, though he begged and\n entreated it of him with many tears, occurred to him the next day of his own accord,\n and he recollected that he ought to appoint judges according to the Rupilian law. He\n draws the names of three out of the urn: he commands them to condemn Heraclius in\n his absence. So they condemn him. \n ",
                "42":"\n What was the meaning of that madness? Did you think that you would never have to\n give an account of your actions? Did you think that such men as these would never\n hear of these transactions? Is such an inheritance to be claimed without the\n slightest grounds for such a claim, in order to become the plunder of the praetor?\n is the name of the city to be introduced? is the base character of a false accuser\n to be fixed upon an honourable state? And not this only, but is the whole business\n to be conducted in such a matter that there is to be not even the least appearance\n of justice kept up? For, in the name of the immortal gods, what difference does it\n make whether the praetor commands and by force compels any one to abandon all his\n property, or passed a sentence by which, without any trial, he must lose all his\n fortune? \n ",
                "43":"\n In truth you cannot deny that you ought to have appointed judges according to the\n provisions of the Rupilian law, especially when Heraclius demanded it. If you say\n that you departed from the law with the consent of Heraclius, you will entangle\n yourself, you will be hampered by the statement you make in your own defence. For if\n that was the case, why, in the first place, did he refuse to appear, when he might\n have had the judges chosen from the proper body which he demanded? Secondly, why,\n after his flight, did you appoint other judges by drawing lots, if you had appointed\n those who had been before appointed, with the consent of each party? Thirdly, Marcus\n Postumius, the quaestor, appointed as the other judges in the market-place; you\n appointed the judges in this case alone. \n ",
                "44":"\n However, by these means, some one will say, he gave that inheritance to the\n Syracusan people. In the first place, even if I were disposed to grant that, still\n you must condemn him; for it is not permitted to us with impunity to rob one man for\n the purpose of giving to another. But you will find that he despoiled that\n inheritance himself without making much secret of his proceedings; that the\n Syracusan people, indeed, had a great deal of the odium, a great deal of the infamy,\n but that another had the profit; that a few Syracusans, those who now say that they\n have come in obedience to the public command of their city, to bear testimony in his\n favour, were then sharers in the plunder, and are come hither now, not for the\n purpose of speaking in his favour, but to assist in the valuation of the damages\n which they claim from him. After he was condemned in his absence, possession is\n given to the palaestra of the Syracusans,—that is, to the Syracusan people,—not only\n of that inheritance which was in question, and which was of the value of three\n millions of sesterces , but also of all Heraclius's\n own paternal property, which was of equal amount. \n ",
                "45":"\n What sort of a partnership in that of yours? You take away a man's inheritance,\n which had come to him from a relation, had come by will, had come in accordance with\n the laws; all which property, he, who made the will, had made over to this Heraclius\n to have and to use as he would, some time before he died,—of which inheritance, as\n he had died some time before you became praetor, there had been no dispute, nor had\n any one made any mention of it. However, be it so; take away inheritances from relations, give them\n to people at the palaestra; plunder other people's property in the name of the\n state; overturn laws, wills, the wishes of the dead, the rights of the living: had\n you any right to deprive Heraclius of his paternal property also? And yet as soon as\n he fled, how shamelessly, how undisguisedly, how cruelly, O ye immortal gods, was\n his property seized! How disastrous did that business seem to Heraclius, how\n profitable to Verres, how disgraceful to the Syracusans, how miserable to everybody!\n For the first measures which are taken are to carry whatever chased plate there was\n among that property to Verres: as for all Corinthian vessels, all embroidered robes,\n no one doubted that they would be taken and seized, and carried inevitably to his\n house, not only out of that house, but out of every house in the whole province. He\n took away whatever slaves he pleased, others he distributed to his friends: an\n auction was held, in which his invincible train was supreme everywhere. \n ",
                "46":"\n But this is remarkable. The Syracusans who presided over what was called the\n collection of this property of Heraclius, but what was in reality the division of\n it, gave in to the senate their accounts of the whole business; they said that many\n pairs of goblets many silver water-ewers, much valuable embroidered cloth, and many\n valuable slaves, had been presented to Verres; they stated how much money had been\n given to each person by his order. The Syracusans groaned, but still they bore it.\n Suddenly this item is read,—that two hundred and fifty thousand sesterces were given to one person by command of the\n praetor. A great outcry arises from every one, not only from every virtuous man, nor\n from those to whom it had always seemed scandalous that the goods of a private\n individual should be taken from him, by the greatest injustice, under the name of\n being claimed by the people, but even the very chief instigators of the wrong; and\n in some degree the partner in the rapine and plunder, began to cry out that the man\n ought to have his inheritance for himself. So great an uproar arise in the\n senate-house, that the people ran to see what had happened. \n ",
                "47":"\n The matter being known to the whole assembly, is soon reported at Verres's house.\n The man was in a rage with those who had read out the accounts,—an enemy to all who\n had raised the outcry; he was in fury with rage and passion. But he was at that\n moment unlike himself. You know the appearance of the man, you know his audacity;\n yet at that moment he was much disquieted by the reports circulated among the\n people, by their outcry, and by the impossibility of concealing the robbery of so\n large a sum of money. When he came to himself, he summoned the Syracusans to him,\n because he could not deny that money had been given him by them; he did not go to a\n distance to look for some one, (in which case he would not have been able to prove\n it,) but he took one of his nearest relations, a sort of second son, and accused him of\n having stolen the money. He declared that he would make him refund it; and he, after\n he heard that, had a proper regard for his dignity, for his age, and for his noble\n birth. He addressed the senate on the subject; he declared to them that he had\n nothing to do with the business Of Verres he said what all saw to be true, and he\n said it plainly enough. Therefore, the Syracusans afterwards erected him a statue;\n and he himself, as soon as he could, left Verres, and departed from the province.\n \n ",
                "48":"\n And yet they say that this man complains sometimes of his misery in being weighed\n down, not by his own offences and crimes, but by those of his friends. You had the\n province for three years; your son-in-law elect, a young man, was with you one year.\n Your companions, gallant men, who were your lieutenants, left you the first year.\n One lieutenant, Publius Tadius, who remained, was not much with you; but if he had\n been always with you, he would with the greatest care have spared your reputation,\n and still more would he have spared his own. What presence have you for accusing\n others? What reason have you for thinking that you can, I will not say, shift the\n blame of your actions on another, but that you can divide it with another? \n ",
                "49":"\n That two hundred and fifty thousand sesterces are\n refunded to the Syracusans, and how they afterwards returned to him by the backdoor,\n I will make evident to you, O judges, by documents and by witnesses. And akin to this iniquity and\n rascality of that fellow, by which plunder, consisting of a part of that property,\n came to many of the Syracusans against the will of the people and senate of\n Syracuse , are those crimes which\n were committed by the instrumentality of Theomnastus, and Aeschrio, and\n Dionysodorus, and Cleomenes, utterly against the wish of the city; first of all in\n plundering the whole city, of which matter I have arranged to speak in another part\n of my accusation, so that, by the assistance of those men whom I have named, he\n carried off all the statues, all the works in ivory out of the sacred temples, all\n the paintings from every place, and even whatever images of the gods he fancied;\n secondly, that in the senate-house of the Syracusans, which they call bouleuth/rion , a most honourable place, and of the\n highest reputation in the eyes of the citizens, where there is a brazen statue of\n Marcus Marcellus himself, (who preserved and restored that place to the Syracusans,\n though by the laws of war and victory he might have taken it away,) those men\n erected a gilt statue to him and another to his son; in order that, as long as the\n recollection of that man remained, the Syracusan senate might never be in the\n senate-house without lamentation and groaning. \n ",
                "50":"\n By means of the same partners in his injuries, and thefts, and bribes, during his\n command the festival of Marcellus at Syracuse is abolished, to the great grief of the city;—a festival\n which they both gladly paid as due to the recent services done them by Caius\n Marcellus, and also most gladly gave to the family and name and race of the\n Marcelli. Mithridates in Asia , when he had\n occupied the whole of that province, did not abolish the festival of Mucius. An enemy, and he too an enemy in other respects, only too\n savage and barbarous, still would not violate the honour of a name which had been\n consecrated by holy ceremonies. You forbade the Syracusans to grant one day of\n festival to the Marcelli, to whom they owed the being able to celebrate other days\n of festival. \n ",
                "51":"\n Oh, but you gave them a splendid day instead of it; you allowed them to celebrate a\n festival in honour of Verres, and issued contracts for providing all that would be\n necessary for sacrifices and banquets on that day for many years. But in such an\n enormous superfluity of impudence as that man's, it seems better to pass over some\n things, that we may not appear to strain every point,—that we may not appear to have\n no feelings but those of indignation. For time, voice, lungs, would fail me, if I\n wished now to cry out how miserable and scandalous it is, that there should be a\n festive day in his name among those people, who think themselves utterly ruined by\n that man's conduct. O splendid Verrine festival! whither have you gone that you have\n not brought the people cause to remember that day? In truth, what house, what city,\n what temple even have you ever approached without leaving it emptied and ruined. Let\n the festival, then, be fitly called Verrine, and appear to be established, not from recollection of your name, but\n of your covetousness and your natural disposition. \n ",
                "52":"\n See, O judges, how easily injustice, and the habit of doing wrong creeps on; see\n how difficult it is to check. There is a town called Bidis, an insignificant one\n indeed, not far from Syracuse . By far\n the first man of that city is a man of the name of Epicrates. An inheritance of five\n hundred thousand sesterces had come to him from\n some woman who was a relation of his, and so near a relation, that even if she had\n died intestate, Epicrates must have been her heir according to the laws of Bidis.\n The transaction at Syracuse which I\n have just mentioned was fresh in men's memories,—the affair I mean of Heraclius the\n Syracusan, who would not have lost his property if an inheritance had not come to\n him. To this Epicrates too an inheritance had come, as I have said. \n ",
                "53":"\n His enemies began to consider that he too might be easily turned out of his\n property by the same praetor as Heraclius had been stripped of his by; they plan the\n affair secretly; they suggest it to Verres by his emissaries. The cause is arranged,\n so that the people belonging to the palaestra at Bidis are to claim his inheritance\n from Epicrates, just as the men of the Syracusan palaestra had claimed his from\n Heraclius. You never saw a praetor so devoted to the interests of the palaestra. But\n he defended the men of the palaestra in such a way that he himself came off with his\n wheels all the better greased. In this instance Verres, as soon as he foresaw what\n would happen, ordered eighty thousand sesterces to\n be paid to one of his friends. \n ",
                "54":"\n The matter could not be kept entirely secret. Epicrates is informed of it by one of\n those who were concerned in it. At first he began to disregard and despise it,\n because the claim made against him had actually nothing in it about which a doubt\n could be raised. Afterwards when he thought of Heraclius, and recollected the\n licentiousness of Verres, he thought it better to depart secretly from the province.\n He did so; he went to Rhegium . And when this was known, they\n began to fret who had paid the money. They thought that nothing could be done in the\n absence of Epicrates. For Heraclius indeed had been present when the judges were\n appointed; but in the case of this man, who had departed before any steps had been\n taken in the action, before indeed there had been any open mention made of the\n dispute, they thought that nothing could be done. The men go to Rhegium ; they go to Epicrates; they point out to\n him, what indeed he knew, that they had paid eighty thousand sesterces ; they beg him to make up to them the money they themselves\n were out of pocket; they tell him he may take any security from them that he likes,\n that none of them will go to law with Epicrates about that inheritance. \n ",
                "55":"\n Epicrates reproaches the men at great length and with great severity, and\n dismisses them. They return from Rhegium to\n Syracuse ; they complain to many\n people, as men in such a case are apt to do, that they have paid eighty thousand\n sesterces for nothing. The affair got abroad; it\n began to be the topic of every one's conversation. Verres repeats his old Syracusan\n trick. He says he wants to examine into that affair of the eighty thousand sesterces . He summons many people before him. The men of\n Bidis say that they gave it to Volcatius; they do not add that they had done so by\n his command. He summons Volcatius; he orders the money to be refunded. Volcatius\n with great equanimity brings the money, like a man who was sure to lose nothing by\n it; he returns it to them in the sight of many people; the men of Bidis carry the\n money away. \n ",
                "56":"\n Some one will say, “What fault then do you find with Verres in this, who not only\n is not a thief himself, but who did not even allow any one else to be one?” Listen a\n moment. Now you shall see that this money which was just now seen to leave his house\n by the main road returned back again by a by-path. What came next? Ought not the\n praetor, having inquired into the case with the bench of judges, when he had found\n out that a companion of his own, with the object of corruptly swaying the law, the\n sentence, and the bench, (a matter in which the reputation of the praetor and even\n his condition as a free citizen were at stake,) had received money, and that the men\n of Bidis had given it, doing injury to the fair fame and fortune of the\n praetor,—ought he not, I say, to have punished both him who had taken the money, and\n those who had given it? You who had determined to punish those who had given an\n erroneous decision, which is often done out of ignorance, do you permit men to\n escape with impunity who thought that money might be received or be paid for the\n purpose of influencing your decree, your judicial decision? And yet that same\n Volcatius remained with you, although he was a Roman knight, after he had such\n disgrace put upon him. \n ",
                "57":"\n For what is more disgraceful for a well-born man—what more unworthy of a free man,\n than to be compelled by the magistrate before a numerous assembly to restore what\n has been stolen; and if he had been of the disposition of which not only a Roman\n knight, but every free man ought to be, he would not have been able after that to\n look you in the face. He would have been a foe, an enemy, after he had been\n subjected to such an insult; unless, indeed, it had been done through collusion with\n you, and he had been serving your reputation rather than his own. And how great a\n friend he not only was to you then as long as he was with you in the province, but\n how great a friend he is even now, when you have long since been deserted by all the\n rest, you know yourself, and we can conceive. But is this the only argument that\n nothing was done without his knowledge, that Volcatius was not offended with him?\n that he punished neither Volcatius nor the men of Bidis? \n ",
                "58":"\n It is a great proof, but this is the greatest proof of all, that to those very men\n of Bidis, with whom he ought to have been angry, as being the men by whom he found\n out that his decree had been attempted to be influenced by bribes, because they\n could do nothing against Epicrates according to law, even if he were present,—to\n these very men, I say, he not only gave that inheritance which had come to\n Epicrates, but, as in the case of Heraclius of Syracuse , so too in this case, (which was even rather more atrocious\n than the other, because Epicrates had actually never had any action brought against\n him at all,) he gave them all his paternal property and fortune. For he showed that\n if any one made a demand of any thing from an absent person, he would hear the\n cause, though without any precedent for so doing. The men of Bidis appear—they claim\n the inheritance. The agents of Epicrates demand that he would either refer them to\n their own laws, or else appoint judges, in accordance with the provisions of the\n Rupilian law. The adversaries did not dare to say anything against this; no escape\n from it could be devised. They accuse the man of having fled for the purpose of\n cheating them. They demand to be allowed to take possession of his property. \n ",
                "59":"\n Epicrates did not owe a farthing to any one. His friends said that, if any one\n claimed anything from him, they would stand the trial themselves, and that they\n would give security to satisfy the judgment. When the whole business was getting cool, by Verres's\n instigation they began to accuse Epicrates of having tampered with the public\n documents; a suspicion from which he was far removed. They demand a trial on that\n charge. His friends began to object that no new proceeding, that no trial affecting\n his rank and reputation, ought to be instituted while he was absent; and at the same\n time they did not cease to reiterate their demands that Verres should refer them to\n their own laws. \n ",
                "60":"\n He, having now got ample room for false accusation, when he sees that there is any\n point on which his friends refused to appear for Epicrates in his absence, declares\n that he will appoint a trial on that charge before any other. When all saw plainly\n that not only that money which had (to make a presence) been sent from his house,\n had returned back to it, but that he had afterwards received much more money, the\n friends of Epicrates ceased to argue in his defence. Verres ordered the men of Bidis\n to take possession of all his property, and to keep it for themselves. Besides the\n five hundred thousand sesterces which the\n inheritance amounted to, his own previous fortune amounted to fifteen hundred\n thousand. Was the affair planned out in this way from the beginning? Was it\n completed in this way? Is it a very trifling sum of money? Is Verres such a man as\n to be likely to have done all this which I have related for nothing? \n ",
                "61":"\n Now, O judges, hear a little about the misery of the\n Sicilians. Both Heraclius the Syracusan, and Epicrates of Bidis, being stripped of\n all their property, came to Rome . They\n lived at Rome nearly two years in mourning\n attire, with unshaven beard and hair. When Lucius Metellus went to the province,\n then they also go back with Metellus, bearing with them letters of high\n recommendation. As soon as Metellus came to Syracuse he rescinded both the sentences—the sentence in the case of\n Epicrates, and that against Heraclius. In the property of both of them there was\n nothing which could be restored, except what was not able to be moved from its\n place. \n ",
                "62":"\n Metellus had acted admirably on his first arrival, in rescinding and making of no\n effect all the unjust acts of that man which he could rescind. He had ordered\n Heraclius to be restored to his property; he was not restored. Every Syracusan\n senator who was accused by Heraclius he ordered to be imprisoned. And on this ground\n many were imprisoned. Epicrates was restored at once. Other sentences which had been\n pronounced at Lilybaeum , at Agrigentum , and at Panormus , were reviewed and reformed. Metellus showed that he did not\n mean to attend to the returns which had been made while Verres was praetor. The\n tithes which he had sold in a manner contrary to the Lex Hieronica, he said that he\n would sell according to that law. All the actions of Metellus went to the same\n point, so that he seemed to be remodeling the whole of Verres's praetorship. As soon\n as I arrived in Sicily , he changed his\n conduct. \n ",
                "63":"\n A man of the name of Letilius had come to him two days before, a man not unversed\n in literature, so he constantly used him as his secretary. He had brought him many\n letters, and, among them, one from home which had changed the whole man. On a sudden\n he began to say that he wished to do everything to please Verres; that he was\n connected with him by the ties of both friendship and relationship. All men wondered\n that this should now at last have occurred to him, after he had injured him by so\n many actions and so many decisions. Some thought that Letilius had come as an\n ambassador from Verres, to put him in mind of their mutual interests, their\n friendship, and their relationship. From that time he began to solicit the cities\n for testimony in favour of Verres, and not only to try to deter the witnesses\n against him by threats, but even to detain them by force. And if I had not by my\n arrival checked his endeavours in some degree, and striven among the Sicilians, by\n the help of Glabrio's letters and of the law, I should not have been able to bring\n so many witnesses into this court. \n ",
                "64":"\n But, as I began to say, remark the miseries of the Sicilians. Heraclius, whom I\n have mentioned, and Epicrates came forward a great distance to meet me, with all\n their friends. When I came to Syracuse , they thanked me with tears; they wished to leave Syracuse , and go to Rome in my company: because I had many other towns\n left which I wanted to go to, I arranged with the men on what day they were to meet\n me at Messana . They sent a messenger to me\n there, that they were detained by the praetor. And though I summoned them formally\n to attend and give evidence,—though I gave in their names to Metellus,—though they\n were very eager to come, having been treated with the most enormous injustice, they\n have not arrived yet. These are the rights which the allies enjoy now, not to be\n allowed even to complain of their distresses. \n ",
                "65":"\n You have already heard the evidence of Heraclius of\n Centuripa, a most virtuous and noble young man, from whom a hundred thousand\n sesterces were claimed by a fraudulent and false\n accusation. Verres, by means of penalties and securities exacted, contrived to extort three hundred thousand; and\n the sentence which had been given in favour of Heraclius, in the affairs about which\n security had been given) he set aside, because a citizen of Centuripa had acted as\n judge between two of his fellow-citizens, and he said that he had given a false\n decision; he forbade him to appear in the senate, and deprived him by an interdict\n of all the privileges of citizens and of access to all public places. If any one\n struck him, he announced that he would take no cognisance of the injury; that if any\n claim were made on him, he would appoint a judge from his own retinue, but that he\n would not allow him an action on any ground whatever. \n ",
                "66":"\n And his authority in the province had just this weight, that no one did strike him,\n though the praetor in his province gave every one leave by word, and in reality\n incited them to do so; nor did any one claim anything of him, though he had given\n licence to false accusation by his authority; yet that heavy mark of ignominy was\n attached to the man as long as Verres remained in the province. After this fear had\n been impressed on the judges, in a manner unexampled and wholly without precedent,\n do you suppose that any matter was decided in Sicily except according to his will and pleasure? Does this appear to\n have been the only effect of it, (which effect, however, it had,) to take his money\n from Heraclius? or was not this also the object, as the means by which the greatest\n plunder was to be got,—to bring, under presence of judicial decision, the property\n and fortune of every one into the power of that one man? \n ",
                "67":"\n But why should I seek out every separate transaction and cause in the trials which\n took place on capital charges? Out of many, which are all nearly alike, I will\n select those which seem to go beyond all the others in rascality. There was a man of\n Halicya, named Sopater, among the first men of his state for riches and high\n character. He, having been accused by his enemies before Caius Sacerdos the praetor,\n on a capital charge, was easily acquitted. The same enemies again accused this same\n Sopater on the same charge before Caius Verres when he had come as successor to\n Sacerdos. The matter appeared trifling to Sopater, both because he was innocent, and\n because he thought that Verres would never dare to overturn the decision of\n Sacerdos. The defendant is cited to appear. The cause is heard at Syracuse . Those changes are brought forward by\n the accusers which had been already previously extinguished, not only by the\n defence, but also by the decision. \n ",
                "68":"\n Quintus Minucius, a Roman knight, among the first for a high and honourable\n reputation, and not unknown to you, O judges, defended the cause of Sopater. There\n was nothing in the cause which seemed possible to be feared, or even to be doubted\n about at all. In the meantime that same Timarchides, that fellow's attendant and\n freedman, who is, as you have learnt by many witnesses at the former hearing, his\n agent and manager in all affairs of this sort, comes to Sopater, and advised him not\n to trust too much to the decision of Sacerdos and the justice of his cause; he tells\n him that his accusers and enemies have thoughts of giving money to the praetor, but\n that the praetor would rather take it to acquit; and at the same time, that he had\n rather, if it were possible, not rescind a decision of his predecessor. Sopater, as\n this happened to him quite suddenly and unexpectedly, was greatly perplexed, and had\n no answer ready to make to Timarchides, except that he would consider what he had\n best do in such a case; and at the same time he told him that he was in great\n difficulties respecting money matters. Afterwards he consulted with his friends; and\n as they advised him to purchase an acquittal, he came to Timarchides. Having\n explained his difficulties to him, he brings the man down to eighty thousand\n sesterces , and pays him that money. \n ",
                "69":"\n When the cause came to be heard, all who were defending Sopater were without any\n fear or any anxiety. No crime had been committed; the matter had been decided;\n Verres had received the money. Who could doubt how it would turn out? The matter is\n not summed up that day; the court breaks up; Timarchides comes a second time to\n Sopater. He says that his accusers were promising a much larger sum to the praetor\n than what he had given, and that if he were wise he would consider what he had best\n do. The man, though he was a Sicilian, and a defendant—that is to say, though he had\n little chance of obtaining justice—and was in an unfortunate position, still would\n not bear with or listen to Timarchides any longer. Do, said he, whatever you please;\n I will not give any more And this, too, was the advice of his friends and defenders;\n and so much the more, because Verres, however he might conduct himself on the trial,\n still had with him on the bench some honourable men of the Syracusan community, who\n had also been on the bench with Sacerdos when this same Sopater had been acquitted.\n They considered that it was absolutely impossible for the same men, who had formerly\n acquitted Sopater, to condemn him now on the same charge, supported by the same\n witnesses. And so with this one hope they came before the court. \n ",
                "70":"\n And when they came thither, when the same men came in numbers on the bench who\n were used to sit there, and when the whole defence of Sopater rested on this hope,\n namely, on the number and dignity of the bench of judges, and on the fact of their\n being, as I have said before, the same men who had before acquitted Sopater of the\n same charge, mark the open rascality and audacity of the man, not attempted to be\n disguised, I will not say under any reason, but with even the least dissimulation.\n He orders Marcus Petilius, a Roman knight, whom he had with him on the bench, to\n attend to a private cause in which he was judge. Petilius refused, because Verres\n himself was detaining his friends whom he had wished to have with him on the bench.\n He, liberal man, said that he did not wish to detain any of the men who preferred\n being with Petilius. And so they all go; for the rest also prevail upon him not to\n detain them, saying that they wished to appear in favour of one or other of the\n parties who were concerned in that trial. And so he is left alone with his most\n worthless retinue. \n ",
                "71":"\n Minucius, who was defending Sopater, did not doubt that Verres, since he had\n dismissed the whole bench, would not proceed with the investigation of his cause\n that day; when all of a sudden he is ordered to state his case. He answers, “To\n whom?” “To me,” says Verres, “if I appear to you of sufficient dignity to try the\n cause of a Sicilian, a Greek.” “Certainly,” says he, “you are of sufficient dignity,\n but I wish for the presence of those men who were present before, and were\n acquainted with the case.” “State your case,” says he; “they cannot be present.”\n “For in truth,” says Quintus Minucius, “Petilius begged me also to be with him on\n the bench;” and at the same time he began to leave his seat as counsel. \n ",
                "72":"\n Verres, in a rage, attacks him with pretty violent language, and even began to\n threaten him severely, for bringing such a charge, and trying to excite such odium\n against him. Minucius,\n who lived as a merchant at Syracuse ,\n in such a way as always to bear in mind his rights and his dignity and who knew that\n it became him not to increase his property in the province at the expense of any\n portion of his liberty, gave the man such answer as seemed good to him, and as the\n occasion and the cause required. He said that he would not speak in defence of his\n client when the bench of judges was sent away and dismissed. And so he left the bar.\n And all the other friends and advocates of Sopater, except the Sicilians, did the\n same. \n ",
                "73":"\n Verres, though he is a man of incredible effrontery and audacity, yet when he was\n thus suddenly left alone got frightened and agitated. He did not know what to do, or\n which way to turn. If he adjourned the investigation at that time, he knew that when\n those men were present, whom he had got rid of for the time, Sopater would be\n acquitted; but if he condemned an unfortunate and innocent man, (while he himself,\n the praetor, was without any colleagues, and the defendant without any counsel or\n patron,) and rescinded the decision of Caius Sacerdos, he thought that he should not\n be able to withstand the unpopularity of such an act. So he was quite in a fever\n with perplexity. He turned himself every way, not only as to his mind, but also as\n to his body; so that all who were present could plainly see that fear and\n covetousness were contending together in his heart. There was a great crowd of\n people present, there was profound silence, and eager expectation which way his\n covetousness was going to find vent. His attendant Timarchides was constantly\n stooping down to his ear. \n ",
                "74":"\n Then at last he said, “Come, state your case.” Sopater began to implore him by the\n good faith of gods and man, to hear the cause in company with the rest of the bench.\n He orders the witnesses to be summoned instantly. One or two of them give their\n evidence briefly. No questions are asked. The crier proclaims that the case is\n closed. Verres, as if he were afraid that Petilius, having either finished or\n adjourned the private cause on which he was engaged, might return to the bench with\n the rest, jumps down in haste from his seat; he condemned an innocent man, one who\n had been acquitted by Caius Sacerdos, without hearing him in his defence, by the\n joint sentence of a secretary, a physician, and a soothsayer. \n ",
                "75":"\n Keep, pray keep that man in the city, O judges. Spare him and preserve him, that\n you may have a man to assist you in judging causes; to declare his opinion in the\n senate on questions of war and peace, without any covetous desires. Although,\n indeed, we and the Roman people have less cause to be anxious as to what his opinion\n in the senate is likely to be: for what will be his authority? When will he have\n either the daring or the power to deliver his opinion? When will a man of such\n luxury and such indolence ever attempt to mount up to the senate-house except in the\n month of February? However, let him come; let him vote war against the\n Cretans, liberty to the Byzantines; let him call Ptolemy king; let him say and think\n everything which Hortensius wishes him.

This the Roman people refuses; this it\n will never endure; the whole people raises an outcry, and gives you leave, if you\n are delighted with these men, if you wish from such a set to add splendour to your\n order, and an ornament to the senate-house, to have that fellow among you as a\n senator, to have him even as a judge in your own cases, if you choose; but men who\n are not of your body, men to whom the admirable Cornelian laws do not give the power\n of objecting to more than three judges, do not choose that this man, so cruel, so\n wicked, so infamous should sit as judge in matters in which they are concerned. \n ",

It is a sin to take money from a\n defendant; how much more to take it from an accuser! how much more wicked still to\n take it from both parties! When you had put up your good faith to auction in the\n province, he had the most weight with you who gave you the most money.—That was\n natural: perhaps some time or other some one else may have done something of the\n same sort. But when you had already disposed of your good faith and of your scruples\n to the one party, and had received the money, and had afterwards sold the very same\n articles to his adversary for a still higher price, are you going to cheat both, and\n to decide as you please? and not even to give back the money to the party whom you\n have deceived? \n ",

Verres\n having often enjoyed his hospitality, and having not only stayed often with him at\n Thermae, but having almost dwelt with him there, took away from him out of his house\n everything which could in any uncommon degree delight the mind or eyes of any one.\n In truth, Sthenius from his youth had collected such things as these with more than\n ordinary diligence; elegant furniture of brass, made at Delos and at Corinth , paintings, and even a good deal of elegantly wrought silver,\n as far as the wealth of a citizen of Thermae could afford. And these things, when he\n was in Asia as a young man, he had\n collected diligently, as I said, not so much for any pleasure to himself, as for\n ornaments against the visits of Roman citizens, his own friends and connections,\n whenever he invited them. \n ",
                "83":"\n But after Verres got them all, some by begging for then, some by demanding them,\n and some by boldly taking them, Sthenius bore it as well as he could, but he was\n affected with unavoidable indignation in his mind, at that fellow having rendered\n his house, which had been so beautifully furnished and decorated, naked and empty;\n still he told his indignation to no one. He thought he must bear the injuries of the\n praetor in silence—those of his guest with calmness. \n ",
                "84":"\n Meantime that man, with that covetousness of his which was now notorious and the\n common talk of every one, as he took a violent fancy to some exceedingly beautiful\n and very ancient statues at Thermae placed in the public place, began to beg of\n Sthenius to promise him his countenance and to aid him in taking them away. But\n Sthenius not only refused, but declared to him that it was utterly impossible that\n most ancient statues, memorials of Publius Africanus, should ever be taken away out\n of the town of the Thermitani, as long as that city and the empire of the Roman\n people remained uninjured. \n ",
                "85":"\n Indeed, (that you may learn at the same time both the humanity and the justice of\n Publius Africanus,) the Carthaginians had formerly taken the town of Himera, one of\n the first towns in Sicily for renown and\n for beauty. Scipio as he thought it a thing worthy of the Roman people, that, after\n the war was over, our allies should recover their property in consequence of our\n victory, took care, after Carthage had\n been taken, that everything which he could manage should be restored to all the\n Sicilians. As Himera had been destroyed, those citizens whom the disasters of the\n war had spared had settled at Thermae, on the border of the same district, and not\n far from their ancient town. They thought that they were recovering the fortune and\n dignity of their fathers, when those ornaments of their ancestors were being placed\n in the town of Thermae. \n ",
                "86":"\n There were many statues of brass; among them a statue of Himera herself, of\n marvellous beauty, made in the shape and dress of a woman, after the name of the\n town and of the river. There was also a statue of the poet Stesichorus, aged,\n stooping,—made, as men think, with the most exceeding skill,—who was, indeed, a\n citizen of Himera, but who both was and is in the highest renown and estimation over\n all Greece for his genius. These things he\n coveted to a degree of madness. There is also, which I had almost passed over, a\n certain she-goat made, as even we who are skilled in these matters can judge, with\n wonderful skill and beauty. These, and other works of art, Scipio had not thrown\n away like a fool, in order that an intelligent man like Verres might have an\n opportunity of carrying them away, but he had restored them to the people of\n Thermae; not that he himself had not gardens, or a suburban villa, or some place or\n other where he could put them; but, if he had taken them home, they would not long\n have been called Scipio's, but theirs to whom they had come by his death. Now they\n are placed in such places that it seems to me they will always seem to be Scipio's,\n and so they are called. \n ",
                "87":"\n When that fellow claimed those things, and the subject was mooted in the senate,\n Sthenius resisted his claim most earnestly, and urged many arguments, for he is\n among the first men in all Sicily for\n fluency of speech. He said that it was more honourable for the men of Thermae to\n abandon their city than to allow the memorials of their ancestors, the spoils of\n their enemies, the gifts of a most illustrious man, the proofs of the alliance and\n friendship with the Roman people, to be taken away out of their city. The minds of\n all were moved. No one was found who did not agree that it was better to die. And so\n Verres found this town almost the only one in the whole world from which he could\n not carry off anything of that sort belonging to the community, either by violence,\n or by stealth, or by his own absolute power, or by his interest, or by bribery. But,\n however, all this covetousness of his I will expose another time; at present I must\n return to Sthenius. \n ",
                "88":"\n Verres being furiously enraged against Sthenius, renounces the connection of\n hospitality with him, leaves his house, and departs; \n for, indeed, he had moved his quarters before. The greatest enemies of Sthenius\n immediately invite him to their houses, in order to inflame his mind against\n Sthenius by inventing lies and accusing him. And these enemies were, Agathinus, a\n man of noble birth, and Dorotheus, who had married Callidama, the daughter of that\n same Agathinus, of whom Verres had heard. So he preferred migrating to the\n son-in-law of Agathinus. Only one night elapsed before he became so intimate with\n Dorotheus, that, as one might say, they had everything in common. He paid as great\n attention to Agathinus as if he had been some connection or relation of his own. He\n appeared even to despise that statue of Himera, because the figure and features of\n his hostess delighted him much more. \n ",
                "89":"\n Therefore he began to instigate the men to create some danger for Sthenius, and to\n invent some accusation against him. They said they had nothing to allege against\n him. On this he openly declared to them, and promised to them that they might prove\n whatever they pleased against Sthenius if they only laid the information before him.\n So they do not delay. They immediately bring Sthenius before him; they say that the\n public documents have been tampered with by him. Sthenius demands, that as his own\n fellow-citizens are prosecuting him on a charge of tampering with the public\n documents, and as there is a right of action on such a charge according to the laws\n of the Thermitani since the senate and people of Rome had restored to the Thermitani their city, and their territory\n and their laws, because they had always remained faithful and friendly; and since\n Publius Rupilius had afterwards, in obedience to a degree of the senate, given laws\n to the Sicilinus, acting with the advice of ten commissioners, according to which\n the citizens were to use their own laws in their actions with one another; and singe\n Verres himself had the same regulation contained in his edict;—on all these\n accounts, I say, he claims of Verres to refer the matter to their own laws. \n ",

It was not difficult to see what that dishonest and wicked\n man was designing. And, indeed, he did not himself very much disguise it, and the\n woman could not hold her tongue. It was understood that his intention was, that,\n after he, without any pleading taking place, and without any witnesses being called,\n had condemned Sthenius, then, infamous that he was, he should cause the man, a man\n of noble birth, of mature age, and his own host, to be cruelly punished by\n scourging. And as this was notorious, by the advice of his friends and connections,\n Sthenius fled from there to Rome . He\n preferred trusting himself to the winter and to the waves, rather than not escape\n that common tempest and calamity of all the Sicilians. \n ",
                "91":"\n That punctual and diligent man is ready at the eighth hour. He orders Sthenius to\n be summoned; and, when he sees that he does not appear, he begins to burn with\n indignation, and to go mad with rage; to despatch officers to his house;\n to send horsemen in every direction about his farms and country houses,—and as he\n kept waiting there till some certain news could be brought to him, he did not leave\n the court till the third hour of the night. The next day he came down again the\n first thing in the morning; he calls Agathinus, he bids him make his statement about\n the public documents against Sthenius in his absence. It was a cause of such a\n character, that, even though he had no adversary in court, and a judge unfriendly to\n the defendant, still he could not find anything to say. \n ",
                "92":"\n So that he confined himself to the mere statement that, when Sacerdos was praetor,\n Sthenius had tampered with the public documents. He had scarcely said this when\n Verres gives sentence “that Sthenius seems to have tampered with the public\n documents,” and, moreover, this man so devoted to Venus, added this besides, with no\n precedent for, no example of, such an addition, “For that action he should adjudge\n five hundred thousand sesterces to Venus Erycina\n out of the property of Sthenius.” And immediately he began to sell his property; and\n he would have sold it, if there had been ever so little delay in paying him the\n money. \n ",
                "93":"\n After it was paid, he was not content with this iniquity; he gave notice openly\n from the seat of justice, and from the tribunal, “That if any one wished to accuse\n Sthenius in his absence of a capital charge, he was ready to take the charge.” And\n immediately he began to instigate Agathinus, his new relation and host, to apply\n himself to such a cause, and to accuse him. But he said loudly, in the hearing of\n every one, that he would not do so, and that he was not so far an enemy to Sthenius\n as to say that he was implicated in any capital crime. Just at this moment a man of\n the name of Pacilius, a needy and worthless man, arrives on a sudden. He says, that\n he is willing to accuse the man in his absence if he may. And Verres tells him that\n he may, that it is a thing often done, and that he will receive the accusation. So\n the charge is made. Verres immediately issues an edict that Sthenius is to appear at\n Syracuse on the first of\n December. \n ",
                "94":"\n He, when he had reached Rome , and had a\n sufficiently prosperous voyage for so unfavourable a time of year, and had found\n everything more just and gentle than the disposition of the praetor, his own guest,\n related the whole matter to his friends, and it appeared to them all cruel and\n scandalous, as indeed it was. Therefore Cnaeus Lentulus and Lucius Gellius the consuls immediately\n propose in the senate that it be established as a law, if it so seem good to the\n conscript fathers, “That men be not proceeded against on capital charges in the\n provinces while they are absent.” They relate to the senate the whole case of\n Sthenius, and the cruelty and injustice of Verres. Verres, the father of the\n praetor, was present in the senate, and with tears begged all the senators to spare\n his son, but he had not much success. For the inclination of the senate for the\n proposal of the consuls was extreme. Therefore opinions were delivered to this\n effect; “that as Sthenius had been proceeded against in his absence, it seemed good\n to the senate that no trial should take place in the case of an absent man; and if\n anything had been done, it seemed good that it should not be ratified.” \n ",
                "95":"\n On that day nothing could be done, because it was so late, and because his father\n had found men to waste the time in speaking. Afterwards the elder Verres goes to all\n the defenders and connections of Sthenius; he begs and entreats them not to attack\n his son, not to be anxious about Sthenius; he assures them that he will take care\n that he suffers no injury by means of his son; that with that object he will send\n trustworthy men into Sicily both by sea and\n land. And it wanted now about thirty days of the first of December, on which day he\n had ordered Sthenius to appear at Syracuse . \n ",
                "96":"\n The friends of Sthenius are moved; they hope that by the letters and messengers of\n the father the Bon may be called off from his insane attempt. The cause is not\n agitated any more in the senate. Family messengers come to Verres, and bring him\n letters from his father before the first of December, before any steps whatever had\n been taken by him in Sthenius's affair; and at the same time many letters about the\n same business are brought to him from many of his friends and intimates. On this he, who had never any\n regard either for his duty or his danger, or for affection, or for humanity, when\n put in competition with his covetousness, did not think, as far as he was advised,\n that the authority of his father, nor, as far as he was entreated, that his\n inclination was to be preferred to the gratification of his own evil passions. On\n the morning of the first of December, according to his edict, he orders Sthenius to\n be summoned. \n ",
                "97":"\n If your father, at the request of any friend, whether influenced by kindness or\n wishing to curry favour with him, had made that petition to you, still the\n inclination of your father ought to have had the greatest weight with you; but when\n he begged it of you for the sake of your own safety from a capital charge, and when\n he had sent trustworthy men from home, and when they had come to you at a time when\n the whole affair was still intact, could not even then a regard, if not for\n affection, at least for your own safety, bring you back to duty and to common sense?\n He summons the defendant. He does not answer. He summons the accuser. (Mark, I pray\n you, O judges; see how greatly fortune herself opposed that man's insanity, and see\n at the same time what chance aided the cause of Sthenius;) the accuser, Marcus\n Pacilius, being summoned, (I know not how it came about,) did not answer, did not\n appear. \n ",
                "98":"\n If Sthenius had been accused while present, if he had been detected in a manifest\n crime, still, as his accuser did not appear, Sthenius ought not to have been\n condemned. In truth, if a defendant could be condemned though his accuser did not\n appear, I should not have come from Vibo to Velia in a little boat through the weapons of fugitive slaves, and\n pirates, and through yours, at a time when all that haste of mine at the peril of my\n life was to prevent your being taken out of the list of defendants if I did not\n appear on the appointed day. If then in this trial of yours that was the most\n desirable thing by you,—namely, for me not to appear when I was summoned, why did\n you not think that it ought also to serve Sthenius that his accuser had not\n appeared? He so managed the matter that the end entirely corresponded to the\n beginning; the same man against whom he had received an accusation while he was\n absent, he condemns now when the accuser is absent. \n ",
                "99":"\n At the very outset news was brought to him that the matter had been agitated in\n the senate, (which his father also had written him word of at great length,) that\n also in the public assembly Marcus Palicanus, a tribune of the people, had made a\n complaint to their of the treatment of Sthenius; lastly, that I myself had pleaded\n the cause of Sthenius before this college of the tribunes of the people, as by their\n edict no one was allowed to remain in Rome \n who had been condemned on a capital charge; and that when I had explained the business as I have now\n done to you, and had proved that this had no right to be considered a condemnation,\n the tribunes of the people passed this resolution, and that it was unanimously\n decreed by them, “That Sthenius did not appear to be prohibited by their edict from\n remaining in Rome .” \n ",
                "100":"\n When this news was brought to him, he for a while was alarmed and agitated; he\n turned the blunt end of his pen on to his\n tablets, and by so doing he overturned the whole of his cause. For he left himself\n nothing which could be defended by any means whatever. For if he were to urge in his\n defence, “It is lawful to take a charge against an absent man, no law forbids this\n being done in a province,” he would seem to be putting forth a faulty and worthless\n defence, but still it would be some sort of a defence. Lastly, he might employ that\n most desperate refuge, of saying, that he had acted ignorantly; that he had thought\n that it was lawful. And although this is the worst defence of all, still he would\n seem to have said something. He erases that from his tablets which he had put down,\n and enters “that the charge was brought against Sthenius while he was present.” \n ",
                "101":"\n Here consider in how many toils he involved himself; from which he could never\n disentangle himself. In the first place, he had often and openly declared himself in\n Sicily from his tribunal, and had\n asserted to many people in private conversation, that it was lawful to take a charge\n against an absent man; that he, for example, had done so himself—which he had. That\n he was in the habit of constantly saying this, was stated at the former pleading by\n Sextus Pompeius Chlorus, a man of whose virtue I have before spoken highly; and by\n Cnaeus Pompeius Theodorus, a man approved of by the judgment of that most\n illustrious man Cnaeus Pompeius in many most important affairs, and, by universal\n consent, a most accomplished person; and by Posides Matro of Solentum, a man of the\n highest rank, of the greatest reputation and virtue. And as many as you please will\n tell you the same thing at this present trial, both men who have heard it from his\n own mouth,—some of the leading men of our order,—and others too who were present\n when the accusation was taken against Sthenius in his absence. Moreover at\n Rome , when the matter was discussed in\n the senate, all his friends, and among them his own father, defended him on the\n ground of its being lawful so to act;—of its having been done constantly;—of his\n having done what he had done according to the example and established precedent of\n others. \n ",
                "102":"\n Besides, all Sicily gives evidence of the\n fact which in the common petitions of all the states has prescribed this request to\n the consuls, “to beg and entreat of the conscript fathers, not to allow charges to\n be received against the absent.” Concerning which matter you heard Cnaeus Lentulus,\n the advocate of Sicily , and a most\n admirable young man, say, that the Sicilians, when they were instructing him in\n their case, and pointing out to him what matters were to be urged in their behalf\n before the senate, complained much of this misfortune of Sthenius, and on account of\n this injustice which had been done to Sthenius, resolved to make this demand which I\n have mentioned. \n ",
                "103":"\n And as this is the ease, were you endued with such insanity and audacity, as, in a\n matter so clear, so thoroughly proved,—made so notorious even by you yourself, to\n dare to corrupt the public records? But how did you corrupt them? Did you not do it\n in such a way that, even if we all kept silence, still your own handwriting would be\n sufficient to condemn you? Give me, it you please, the document. Take it round to\n the judges; show it to them. Do you not see that the whole of this entry, where he\n states that the charge was made against Sthenius in his presence, is a correction?\n What was written there before? What blunder did he correct when he made that\n erasure? Why, O judges, do you wait for proofs of this charge from us? We say\n nothing; the books are before you, which cry out themselves that they have been\n tampered with and amended. \n ",
                "104":"\n Do you think you can possibly escape out of this business, when we are following\n you up, not by any uncertain opinion, but by your own traces, which you have left\n deeply printed and fresh in the public documents? Has he decided, (I should like to\n know,) without hearing the cause, that Sthenius has tampered with the public\n documents, who cannot possibly defend himself from the charge of having tampered\n with the public documents in the case of that very Sthenius? \n ",
                "105":"\n See now another instance of madness; see how, in trying to acquit himself; he\n entangles himself still more. He assigns an advocate to Sthenius.—Whom? Any relation\n or intimate friend? No.—Any citizen, any honourable and noble man of Florence ? Not even that.—At least it was some\n Sicilian, in whom there was some credit and dignity? Far from it.—Whom then did he\n assign to him? A Roman citizen. Who can approve of this? When Sthenius was the man\n of the highest rank in his city, a man of most extensive connections, with\n numberless friends; when, besides, he was of the greatest influence all over\n Sicily , by his own personal character and\n popularity; could he find no Sicilian who was willing to be appointed his advocate?\n Will you approve of this? Did he himself prefer a Roman citizen? Tell me what\n Sicilian, when he was defendant in any action, ever had a Roman citizen assigned to\n him as his advocate? Produce the records of all the praetors who preceded Verres;\n open them. If you find one such instance, I will then admit to you that this was\n done as you have entered it in your public documents. \n ",
                "106":"\n Oh but, I suppose, Sthenius thought it honourable to himself for Verres to choose\n a man for his advocate out of the number of Roman citizens who were his own friends\n and connections! Whom did he choose? Whose name is written in the records? Caius\n Claudius, the son of Caius, of the Palatine \n tribe. I do not ask who this Claudius is; how illustrious, how honourable, how well\n suited to the business, and deserving that, because of his influence and dignity,\n Sthenius should abandon the custom of all the Sicilians, and have a Roman citizen\n for his advocate. I do not ask any of these questions;—for perhaps Sthenius was\n influenced not by the high position of the man, but by his intimacy with him.—What?\n What shall we say if there was in the whole world a greater enemy to Sthenius than\n this very Caius Claudius, both constantly in old times, and especially at this time\n and in this affair?—if he appeared against him on the charge of tampering with the\n public documents?—if he opposed him by every means in his power? Which shall we\n believe,—that an enemy of Sthenius was actually appointed his advocate, or that you,\n at a time of the greatest danger to Sthenius, made free with the name of his enemy,\n to ensure his ruin? \n ",
                "107":"\n And that no one may have any doubt as to the real nature of the whole transaction,\n although I feel sure that by this time that man's rascality is pretty evident to you\n all, still listen yet a little longer. Do you see that man with curly hair, of a\n dark complexion, who is looking at us with such a countenance as shows that he seems\n to himself a very clever fellow? him, I mean, who has the papers in his hand—who is\n writing—who is prompting him—who is next to him. That is Caius Claudius, who in\n Sicily was considered Verres's agent and\n interpreter, the manager of all his dirty work, a sort of colleague to Timarchides.\n Now he is promoted so high that he scarcely seems to yield to Apronius in intimacy\n with him; indeed he called himself the colleague and ally not of Timarchides, but of\n Verres himself. \n ",
                "108":"\n Now doubt, if you can, that he chose that man of all the world to impose the\n worthless character of a false advocate on, whom he knew to be most hostile to\n Sthenius, and most friendly to himself. And will you hesitate in this case, O\n judges, to punish such enormous audacity and cruelty and injustice as that of this\n man? Will you hesitate to follow the example of those judges, who, when they had\n condemned Cnaeus Dolabella, rescinded the condemnation of Philodamus of Opus,\n because a charge had been received against him not in his absence, which is of all\n things the most unjust and the most intolerable, but after a commission had been\n given him by his fellow-citizens to proceed to Rome as their ambassador? That precedent which the judges, in\n obedience to the principles of equity, established in a less important cause, will\n you hesitate to adopt in a cause of the greatest consequence, especially now that it\n has been established by the authority of others? \n ",
                "109":"\n But who was it, O Verres, whom you treated with such great, with such unexampled\n injustice? Against whom did you receive a charge in his absence? Whom did you\n condemn in his absence; not only without any crime, and without any witness, but\n even without any accuser? Who was it? O ye immortal gods! I will not say your own\n friend,—that which is the dearest title among men. I will not say your host,—which\n is the most holy name. There is nothing in Sthenius's case which I speak of less\n willingly. The only thing which I find it possible to blame him in is,—that he, a\n most moderate and upright man, invited you, a man full of adultery, and crime, and\n wickedness, to his house; that he, who had been and was connected by ties of\n hospitality with Caius Marius, with Cnaeus Pompeius, with Caius Marcellus, with\n Lucius Sisenna, your defender, and with other excellent citizens, added your name\n also to that of those unimpeachable men. \n ",

                "111":"\n Is not Sthenius the man, he who when he had very easily obtained all the\n honourable offices in his city, executed them with the greatest splendor, and\n magnificence?—who decorated a town, not itself of the first rank, with most spacious\n places of public resort, and most splendid monuments, at his own expense?—on account\n of whose good services towards the state of Thermae, and towards all the Sicilians,\n a brazen tablet was set up in the senate-house at Thermae; in which mention was made\n of his services, and engraved at the public expense?—which tablet was torn down\n under your government, and is now brought hither by me, that all may know the honour\n in which he was held among his countrymen, and his preeminent dignity. \n ",

Lastly, is not he the\n man who had such affection towards the republic, and also such great authority among\n his fellow-citizens, that he alone in all Sicily , while you were praetor, did what not only no other Sicilian,\n but what all Sicily even could not\n do,—namely, prevented you from taking away any statue, any ornament, any sacred\n vessel, or any public property from Thermae; and that too when there were many\n remarkable beautiful things there, and though you coveted everything? \n ",

Him very many cities of Sicily praise by public resolutions in his favour, by their own\n evidence, by deputations went hither with that object. You, the patron of all the\n Sicilians, the solitary state of the Mamertini, the partner of your thefts and\n crimes, praises publicly; and yet in such a way that, by a new process, the deputies\n themselves injure your cause, though the deputation praises you. These other states\n all publicly accuse you, complain of you, impeach you by letters, by deputations, by\n evidence; and, if you are acquitted, think themselves utterly ruined. \n ",

I saw a Cupid made of silver, with a torch. What object had\n you,—what reason was there for employing the plunder of Sthenius on that subject\n rather than on any other? Did you wish it to be a token of your own cupidity, or a\n trophy of your friendship and connection of hospitality with him, or a proof of your\n love towards him? Men, who in their excelling wickedness are pleased not only with\n their lust and pleasure itself, but also with the fame of their wickedness, do wish\n to leave in many places the marks and traces of their crimes. \n ",

I should think you grateful\n to the Gods if you had given this gift to Venus, not out of the property of\n Sthenius, but out of your own, as you ought to have done, especially as an\n inheritance had come to you from Chelidon that very same year. \n ",

I should think it became me to follow the example of their good\n feeling and regard for their duty; and I should hold out hope to my friends and\n connections to think that they would live a safer life owing to my protection. But\n when the cause of Sthenius draws along with it the common calamity of the whole\n province, and when many of my friends and connections are being defended by me at\n the same time, both in their public and private interests, I ought not in truth to\n fear that any one can suppose that I have done what I have in undertaking this cause\n under the pressure and compulsion of any motive except that of the strictest duty.\n And that we may at last\n give up speaking of the investigations made, and the judicial proceedings conducted,\n and of the decisions given by that man; and as his exploits of that class are\n countless, let us put some bounds and limits to our speech and accusation.

You know that Cnaeus Sertius and Marcus Modius,\n Roman knights, and that six hundred Roman citizens besides, and many Sicilians, said\n that they had given that money for decisions in their causes. And why need I dilate\n upon this accusation when the whole matter is set plainly forth in the evidence? Why\n should I argue about what no one can doubt? Or will any man in the world doubt that\n he set up his judicial decisions for sale in Sicily , when at Rome he\n sold his very edict and all his decrees? and that he received money from the\n Sicilians in issuing extraordinary decrees, when he actually made a demand on Marcus\n Octavius Ligur for giving a decision on his cause? \n ",
                "119":"\n For what method of extorting money did he ever omit? What method did he fail to\n devise, even if it had escaped the notice of every one else?

At the\n former pleading evidence was given of both a public and a private nature; deputies\n from Centuripa, from Halesa, from Catina ,\n and from Panormus , and from many other\n cities gave evidence; but now, also, a great many private individuals have been\n examined, by whose testimony you have ascertained that no one in all Sicily for the space of three years was ever made\n senator in any city for nothing,—no one by vote, as their laws prescribe,—no one\n except by his command, or by his letters; and that in the appointment of all these\n senators, not only were no votes given, but there was not even any consideration of\n those families from which it was lawful to select men for that body, nor of their\n income, nor of their age; nor were any other of the Sicilian laws of the slightest\n influence. \n ",
                "120":"\n Whoever wished to be made a senator, though he was a boy, though he was unworthy,\n though he was of a class from which it was not lawful to take senators; still, if he\n paid money enough to appear in his eyes a fit man to gain his object, so it always\n was. Not only the laws of the Sicilians had no influence in this matter, but even\n those which had been given to them by the senate and people of Rome had none either. For the laws which he makes\n who has the supreme command given to him by the Roman people, and authority to make\n laws conferred on him by the senate, ought to be considered the laws of the senate\n and people of Rome . \n ",

The senate, by a very honourable\n decree, voted that Caius Claudius Pulcher, the son of Appius the praetor, should\n give them laws to regulate their elections into their senate. Caius Claudius, taking\n as his counselors all the Marcelli who were then alive, with their advice gave laws\n to the men of Halesa in which he laid down many rules about the age of the men who\n might be elected; that no one might be under thirty years of age; about trade,—that\n no one engaged in it might be elected; about their income, and about all other\n matters; all which regulations prevailed till that man became praetor by the\n authority of our magistrates, and with the cordial good-will of the men of Halesa.\n But from him even a crier who was desirous of it, bought that rank for a sum of\n money, and boys sixteen and seventeen years old purchased the title of senator; and\n that which the men of Halesa, our most ancient and faithful allies and friends, had\n petitioned, and that successfully, at Rome , to have put on such a footing that it might not be lawful for men\n to be elected even by vote, he now made easy to be obtained by bribery. \n ",
                "122":"\n The people of Agrigentum have old laws\n about appointing their senate, given them by Scipio, in which the same principles\n are laid down, and this one besides,—as there are two classes of Agrigentines, one\n of the old inhabitants, and the other of the new,—settlers whom Titus Manlius, when\n praetor, had led from other towns of the Sicilians to Agrigentum , in obedience to a resolution of the senate;—it was\n provided in the laws of Scipio, that there should not be a greater number of members\n of the senate taken from the class of settlers than from the old inhabitants of\n Agrigentum . That man, who had levelled\n all laws by bribery, and who had taken away all distinction between things for\n money, not only disturbed all those regulations which related to age, rank, and\n traffic, but even with respect to these two classes of old and new inhabitants, he\n disturbed the proportion of their selection. \n ",
                "123":"\n For when a senator died of the old inhabitants, and when the remaining number of\n each class was equal, it was necessary, according to the laws, that one of the\n original inhabitants should be elected in order that there might be the larger\n number. And though this was the case, still, not only some of the original\n inhabitants, but also some of the new settlers, came to him to purchase the rank of\n senator. The result is, that through bribery, one of the new men carries the day,\n and gets letters of appointment from the praetor. The Agrigentines send deputies to\n him to inform him of their laws, and to explain to him the invariable usage of past\n years, in order that he might be aware that he had sold that rank to one with whom\n he had no right even to treat on the subject. By whose speech, as he had already\n received the money, he was not in the least influenced. \n ",
                "124":"\n He did the same thing at Heraclea .

There\n he did not only receive money, as he did in the other cities, but he even confused\n the class of the original inhabitants and of the new settlers. Do not wait for me to go through all the\n cities of Sicily in my speech. In this one\n statement I comprehend everything,—that no one could be made a senator while he was\n praetor except those who had given him money. \n ",
                "125":"\n And I carry on the same charge to all magistracies, agencies, and priesthoods; by\n which acts he has not only trampled on the laws of men, but on all the religious\n reverence due to the immortal gods.

When it came to the\n decision by lot, which he could not command, men were waiting to see what he would\n do. The fellow at first forbade them to elect by lot, as that seemed the easiest\n way, and ordered Theomnastus to be appointed without casting lots. The Syracusans\n say that cannot possibly be done, according to the reverence due to their sacred\n laws; they say it would be impious. He orders the law to be read to him. It is read.\n In it was written, “that as many lots were to be thrown into the urn as there were\n names returned; that he whose name was drawn was to have the priesthood.” He then,\n ingenious and clever man! said, “Capital! it is written, ‘As many lots as there are\n names returned;’ how many names then were returned?” It is answered, “Three.” “Is\n there then anything necessary except that three lots should be put in, and one drawn\n out?” “Nothing.” He orders three lots to be put in, on all of which was written the\n name of Theomnastus. A great outcry arises as it seemed to every one a scandalous\n and infamous proceeding. And so by these means that most honourable priesthood is\n given to Theomnastus. \n ",
                "127":"\n At Cephalaedium there is a regular month, in which the pontifex is bound to be\n appointed. A man of the name of Artemo, surnamed Climachias, was desirous of that\n honour a man of sufficient riches to be sure, and of noble family; but he could not\n possibly have been appointed if a man of the name of Herodotus had been present. For\n that place and rank was thought to be so decidedly due to him for that year, that\n even Climachias could say nothing against him. The matter is referred to Verres, and\n is decided according to his usual fashion. Some beautiful and valuable specimens of\n carving are removed from Artemo's. Herodotus was at Rome ; he thought that he should arrive in time enough for the comitia\n if he came the day before. Verres, in order that the comitia might not be held in\n any other month than the regular one, and that the honour might not be refused to\n Herodotus when he was present, (a thing which he was not anxious for, and which\n Climachias was very eager to avoid,) contrives, (I have said before, there is no one\n cleverer, and never was, in his way,)—he contrives, I say, how the comitia may be\n held in the regular month for them, and yet Herodotus may not be able to be\n present. \n ",
                "128":"\n It is a custom of the Sicilians, and of the rest of the Greeks, because they wish\n their days and months to agree with the calculations as to the sun and moon, if\n there be any difference sometimes to take out a day, or, at most, two days from a\n month, which they call e)caire/simoi . And so also\n they sometimes make a month longer by a day or by two days. And when he heard of\n that, he, this new astronomer, who was thinking not so much of the heavens as of the\n heavy plate, he orders (not a day to be\n taken out of the month, but) a month and a half to be taken out of the year; so that\n the day which, as one may say, ought to have been the thirteenth of January, became\n the first of March. And that is done in spite of the remonstrances and indignation\n of every one. That was the legitimate day for holding the comitia. On that day\n Climachias is declared to have been elected priest. \n ",
                "129":"\n When Herodotus returns from Rome ,\n fifteen days, as he supposed, before the comitia, he comes on the month of the\n comitia, when the comitia have been held thirty days before. Then the people of\n Cephalaedium voted an intercalary month of forty-five days, in order that the rest\n of the months might fall again into their proper season. If these things could be\n done at Rome , no doubt he would somehow or\n other have contrived to have the forty-five days between the two sets of games taken\n away, during which days alone this trial could take place. \n ",
                "130":"\n But now it is worth while to see how the censors were appointed in Sicily while that man was praetor. For that is the\n magistracy among the Sicilians, the appointments to which are made by the people\n with the greatest care, because all the Sicilians pay a yearly tax in proportion to\n their incomes; and, in making the census, the power is entrusted to the censor of\n making every sort of valuation, and of determining the total amount of every man's\n contribution. Therefore the people choose with the greatest care the man in whom\n they can place the greatest confidence in a matter affecting their own property; and\n on account of the greatness of the power, this magistracy is an object of the\n greatest ambition. \n ",
                "131":"\n In such a matter, Verres did not choose to do any thing obscurely, nor to play\n tricks in the drawing of lots, nor to take days out of the calendar. He did not\n choose to do anything in an underhand manner, or by means of artifice; but in order\n to take away the fondness and desire for honours and ambition out of every city,\n feelings which usually tend to the ruin of a state, he declared that he should\n appoint the censors in every city. \n ",
                "132":"\n When the praetor announced so vast a scene of bargaining and trafficking as that,\n people came to Syracuse to see him,\n from all quarters. The whole of the praetor's house was on fire with the eagerness\n and cupidity of men; and no wonder, when all the comitia of so many cities were\n packed together into one house, and when all the ambition of an entire province was\n confined in one chamber. Bribes being openly asked for, and biddings being openly\n made, Timarchides appointed two censors for every city. He, by his own labour, and\n by his own visits to every one, by all the trouble which he took in this employment,\n achieved this, that all the money came to Verres without his having any anxiety on\n his part. How much money this Timarchides made, you cannot as yet know; for a\n certainty; but in what a variety of manners, and how shamefully, he plundered\n people, you heard at the former pleading, by the evidence of many witnesses. \n ",
                "133":"\n But that you may not wonder how that freedman obtained so much influence with him,\n I will tell you briefly what the man is; so that you may both see the worthlessness\n of the man who kept such a fellow about him, especially in that employment and\n position, and that you may also see the misery of the province. In the seduction of\n women, and in all licentiousness and wickedness of that character, I found this\n Timarchides wonderfully fitted by nature to be subservient to his infamous lusts,\n and unexampled profligacy. In finding out who people were, in calling on them, in\n addressing them, in bribing them, in doing anything in matters of that sort, however\n cunningly, however audaciously, however shamelessly it might be necessary to go to\n work, I heard that this man could contrive admirable schemes for ensuring success.\n For, as for Verres himself, he was only a man of a covetousness ever open-mouthed,\n and ever threatening, but he had no ingenuity, no resources; so that, in whatever he\n did of his own accord, (just as you know was the case with him at Rome ,) he seemed to rob openly rather than to\n cheat. \n ",
                "134":"\n But the other fellow's skill and artifice were marvellous, so that he could hunt\n out and scent out with the greatest acuteness, all over the province, whatever had\n happened to any one, whatever any one stood in need of. He was able to find out, to\n converse with, to tamper with every one's foes, and every one's enemies; to know the\n circumstances of every trial on both sides; to ascertain men's inclinations, and\n power, and resources; where it was necessary to strike terror; where it was\n desirable to hold out hope. Every accuser, every informer, he had in his power, if\n he wished to cause trouble to any one, he did it without any difficulty. All\n Verres's decrees, and commands, and letters, he sold in the most skillful and\n cunning manner. \n ",
                "135":"\n And he was not only the minister of Verres's pleasures, he also took equally good\n care of himself. He not only picked up whatever money had slipped through his\n principal's fingers, by which he amassed great riches, but he also picked up the\n relics of his pleasures and of his profligacy. Therefore do not fancy that Athenio\n reigned in\n Sicily , for he took no city; but know ye\n that the runaway slave Timarchides reigned in every city of Sicily for three years; that the children, the\n matrons, the property, and all the fortunes of the most ancient and most devoted\n allies of the Roman people were all that time in the power of Timarchides. He\n therefore, as I say, he, Timarchides, sent censors into every city, having taken\n bribes for their appointment. Comitia for the election of censors, while Verres was\n praetor, were never held not even for the purpose of making a presence of legality.\n \n ",
                "136":"\n This was the most shameless business of all. Three hundred denarii were openly\n exacted (for this, forsooth, was permitted by the laws) from each censor, to be paid\n down for the praetors statue. There were appointed a hundred and thirty censors.\n They gave one sum of money for the censorship contrary to the law; these thirty-nine\n thousand denarii they openly paid down for the statue, in compliance with the laws.\n First of all, what was all that money for? Secondly, why did the censors pay it to\n you for your statue? I suppose there is a regular order of censors, a college of\n them. They are a distinct class of men! Why, it is either cities in their capacity\n of communities, that confer these honours, or men according to their classes, as\n cultivators, as merchants, as shipowners. But why to censors rather than to aediles?\n Is it for any service that they have done? Therefore, will you confess that these\n things were begged of you,—for you will not dare to say they were purchased of\n you;—that you granted those magistracies to men out of favour, and not with a new to\n the interests of the republic? And when you confess this, will any one doubt that\n you incurred that unpopularity held hatred among the different tribes of that\n province, not out of ambition, nor for the sake of doing a kindness to any one, but\n with the object of procuring money? \n ",
                "137":"\n Therefore those censors did the same thing that those do in our republic, who have\n got offices by bribery; they took care to use their power so as to fill up again\n that gap in their property. The census was so taken, when you were praetor, that the\n affairs of no state whatever could be administered according to such a census. For\n they made a low return of the incomes of all the richest men, and exaggerated that\n of each poor man. And so in levying the taxes so heavy a burden was laid upon the\n common people, that even if the men themselves said nothing, the facts alone would\n discredit that census, as may easily be understood from the circumstances\n themselves. For Lucius\n Metellus who, after I came into Sicily for\n the sake of prosecuting my injuries, became on a sudden after the arrival of\n Letilius not only the friend of Verres, but even his relative; because he saw that\n that census could not possibly stand, ordered that former one to be attended to\n which had been when that most gallant and upright man, Sextus Peducaeus, was\n praetor. For at that time there were censors made according to the laws, elected by\n their cities, in whose case, if they did anything wrong, punishments were appointed\n by the law. \n ",
                "138":"\n But when you were praetor, how could the censor either fear the law, by which he\n was not bound, since he had not been created by the law; or fear your reproof for\n having sold what he had bought of you? Let Metellus now detain my witnesses—let him\n compel others to praise him, as he has attempted in many instances; only let him do\n what he is doing. For whoever was treated by any one with such insult, with so much\n ignominy? Every fifth year a census is taken of all Sicily . A census was taken when Peducaeus was praetor. When the five\n years had elapsed in your praetorship, a census was taken again. The next year\n Lucius Metellus forbids any mention to be made of your census; he says that censors\n must be created afresh; and in the meantime he orders the census of Peducaeus to be\n attended to. If an enemy of yours had done this to you, although the province would\n have borne it with great equanimity, still it would have seemed the severe decision\n of an enemy. A new friend, a voluntary relation did it. For he could not do\n otherwise, if he wished to retain the province in its allegiance, if he wished to\n live himself in safety in the province. \n ",
                "139":"\n Are you waiting to see what these men also will decide? If he had deprived you of\n your office, he would have treated you with less insult, than when he abrogated and\n annulled the things which you had done in your office. Nor did he behave in this way\n in that matter alone, but he had done the same in many other matters of the greatest\n importance, before I arrived in Sicily . For\n he ordered your friends, the palaestra people, to restore his property to Heraclius\n the Syracusan, and the people of Bidis to restore his property to Epicrates, and\n Appius Claudius his to his ward at Drepanum ; and, if Letilius had not arrived in Sicily with letters a little too soon, in less than\n thirty days Metellus would have annulled your whole three years' praetorship. \n ",
                "140":"\n \n And, since I have spoken of that money which the censors\n paid to you for your statue, it seems to me that I ought not to pass over that\n method of raising money, which you exacted from the cities on presence of erecting\n statues. For I see that the sum total of that money is very large, amounting to a\n hundred and twenty thousand sesterces . This much is\n proved by the evidence and letters of the cities. And he admits that, and indeed he\n cannot say otherwise. What sort of conduct then are we to think that which he\n denies, when these actions which he confesses are so infamous? For what do you wish\n to be believed? That all that money was spent in statues?—Suppose it was. Still this\n is by no means to be endured, that the allies should be robbed of so much money, in\n order that statues of a most infamous robber may be placed in every alley, where it\n appears scarcely possible to pass in safety. \n ",
                "141":"\n But where in the world, or on what statues, was that enormous sum of money spent?\n It will be spent, you will say. Let us, forsooth, wait for the recurrence of that\n regular five years. If in this interval he has not spent it then at last we will\n impeach him for embezzlement in the article of statues. He is brought before the\n court as a criminal on many most important charges. We see that a hundred and twenty\n thousand sesterces have been taken on this one\n account. If you are condemned, you will not, I presume, trouble yourself about\n having that money spent on statues within five years. If you are acquitted, who will\n be so insane as to attack you in five years' time on the subject of the statues,\n after you have escaped from so many and such grave charges? If, therefore, this\n money has not been spent as yet, and if it is evident that it will not be spent, we\n may understand that a plan has been found out by which he may take and appropriate\n to himself a hundred and twenty thousand sesterces \n at one swoop, and by which others too, if this is sanctioned by you, may take as\n large sums as ever they please on similar grounds; so that we shall appear not to\n deter men from taking money, but, as we approve of some methods of taking money, we\n shall seem rather to be giving decent names to the basest actions. \n ",
                "142":"\n In truth, suppose, for example, that Caius Verres had demanded a hundred and\n twenty thousand sesterces from the people of\n Centuripa, and had taken this money from them; there would have been no doubt, I\n conceive, that, if that were proved, he must have been condemned.—What then? Suppose\n he demanded three hundred thousand sesterces of the\n same people; and compelled them to give them, and carried them off? Shall he be\n acquitted because it was entered in the accounts that that money was given for\n statues? I think not; unless, indeed, our object is to create, not an unwillingness\n to take money on the part of our magistrates, but a cause for giving it on the part\n of our allies. But if statues are a great delight to any one, and if any one is\n greatly attracted by the honour and glory of having them raised to him, still he\n must lay down these rules; first of all, that he must not take to his own house the\n money given for those purposes; secondly, that there must be some limit to those\n statues; and lastly, that at all events they must not be exacted from unwilling\n people. \n ",
                "143":"\n And concerning the embezzlement of the money, I ask of you whether the cities\n themselves were accustomed to let out contracts for erecting statues to the man who\n would take the contract on the best terms, or to appoint some surveyor to\n superintend the erection of the statues, or to pay the money to you, or to any one\n whom you appointed? For the statues were erected under the superintendence of those\n men by whom that honour was paid to you—I am glad to hear it; but, if that money was\n paid to Timarchides, cease I beg of you, to pretend that you were desirous of glory\n and of monuments when you are detected is so evident a robbery. What then? Is there to be no limit to statues? But there must be.\n Indeed, consider the matter in this way. \n ",
                "144":"\n The city of Syracuse (to speak of\n that city in preference to others) gave him a statue;—it is an honour: and gave his\n father one;—a pretty and profitable picture of affection: and gave his son one;—this\n may be endured, for they did not hate the boy: still how often, and for how many\n individuals will you take statues from the Syracusans? You accepted one to be placed\n in the forum. You compelled them to place one in the senate-house. You ordered them\n to contribute money for those statues which were to be erected at Rome . You ordered that the same men should also\n contribute as agriculturists, they did so. You ordered the same men also to pay\n their contribution to the common revenue of Sicily ; even that they did also. When one city contributed money on\n so many different presences, and when the other cities did the same, does not the\n fact itself warn you to think that some bounds must be put to this covetousness? But\n if no city did this of its own accord; if all of them only paid you this money for\n statues because they were induced to do so by your command, by fear, by force, by\n injury; then, O ye immortal gods, can it be doubtful to any one, that, even if any\n one were to establish a law, that it was allowable to accept money for statues,\n still he would also establish one, that at all events it was not allowable to extort\n it? \n ",
                "145":"\n First, therefore, I will cite the whole of Sicily as a witness on this point; and Sicily declares to me with one voice that an immense sum of money was\n extorted from her by force under the name of providing statues. For the deputations\n of all the cities, in their common petitions—nearly all of which have arisen from\n your injuries,—have inserted this demand also; “that they might not for the future\n promise statues to any one till he had left the province.” There have been many praetors in\n Sicily . Often, in the times of our\n ancestors, the Sicilians have approached the senate; often in the memory of the\n present generation; but it is your praetorship that has introduced and originated a\n new kind of petition. \n ",
                "146":"\n For what else is so strange, not only in the matter but in the very form of the\n petition? For other points which occur in the same petitions with reference to your\n injuries, are indeed novel, but still they are not urged in a novel manner. The\n Sicilians beg and entreat of the conscript fathers that our magistrates may\n henceforth sell the tenths according to the law of Hiero. You were the first who had\n sold them in a way contrary to that law.—That they may not put a money value on the\n corn which is ordered for the public granary. This, too, is now requested for the\n first time on account of your three denarii: but that kind of petition is not\n unprecedented.—That a charge be not taken against any one in his absence. This has\n arisen from the misfortune of Sthenius, and your tyranny.—I will not enumerate the\n other points. All the demands of the Sicilians are of such a nature that they look\n like charges collected against you alone as a criminal. Still all these, though they\n refer to new injuries, preserve the ordinary form of requests. \n ",
                "147":"\n But this request about the statues must seem ridiculous to the man who is not\n acquainted with the facts and with the meaning of it; for they entreat that they may\n not be compelled to erect statues;—what then? That they may not be allowed to do\n so;—what does this mean? Do you request of me not to be allowed to do what it\n depends on yourself to do or not? Ask rather that no one may compel you to promise a\n statue, or to erect one against your will. I shall do no good, says he; for they\n will all deny that they compelled me to do so: if you wish for my preservation, put\n this violence on me,—that it may be utterly illegal for me to make such a promise.\n It is from your praetorship that such a request as this has taken its rise; and\n those who employ it, intimate and openly declare that they, entirely against their\n will, contributed money for your statues, being compelled by fear and violence. \n ",
                "148":"\n Even suppose they did not say this, still, would it not be impossible for you to\n avoid confessing it? See and consider what defence you are going to adopt; for then\n you will understand that you must confess this about the statues. For I am informed that your cause is\n planned out in this way by your advocates, men of great ingenuity, and that you are\n instructed and trained by them in this way; that, as each influential and honourable\n man from the province of Sicily gives an\n energetic testimony against you, as many of the lending Sicilians have already done\n to a great extent, you are immediately to say to your defenders, “That man is an\n enemy of mine because he is an agriculturist. And so, I suppose, you have it in your\n mind to set aside the class of agriculturists, saving that they have come with a\n hostile and inimical disposition towards Verres because he was a little strict in\n collecting the tenths. The agriculturists, then, are all your enemies, all your\n adversaries. There is not one of them who does not wish you dead. Altogether you are\n admirably well off, when that order and class of men which is the most virtuous and\n honourable, by which both the republic in general, and most especially that province\n upheld, as fixedly hostile to you. \n ",
                "149":"\n However, be it so; another time we will consider of the disposition of the\n agriculturists and of their injuries. For the present I assume, what you grant me,\n that they are most hostile to you. You say, forsooth, on account of the tenths. I\n grant that; I do not inquire whether they are enemies with or without reason. What\n then is the meaning of those gilt equestrian statues which greatly offend the\n feelings and eyes of the Roman people, near the temple of\n Vulcan ? For I see an inscription on them\n stating that the agriculturists had presented one of them. If they gave this statue\n to do you honour, they are not your enemies. Let us believe the witnesses; for then\n they were consulting your honour, now they are regarding their own consciences. But\n if they presented the statues under the compulsion of fear, you must confess that\n you exacted money in the province on account of statues by violence and fear. Choose\n whichever alternative you like. \n ",
                "150":"\n In truth I would willingly now abandon this charge about the statues, to have you\n admit to me, what would be most honourable to you, that the agriculturists\n contributed this money for a statue to do you honour, of their own free will. Grant\n me this. In a moment you cut from under your feet the principal part of your\n defence. For then you will not be able to say that the agriculturists were angry\n with and enemies to you. O singular cause; O miserable and ruinous defence; for the\n defendant, and he too a defendant who has been praetor in Sicily , to be unwilling to receive an admission from\n his accuser that the agriculturists erected him a statue of their own free will,\n that they have a good opinion of him, that they are his friends, that they desire\n his safety! He is afraid of your believing this, for he is overwhelmed with the\n evidence given against him by the agriculturists. \n ",
                "151":"\n I will avail myself of what is granted to me; at all events you must judge that\n those men, who, as he himself wishes it to be believed, are most hostile to him, did\n not contribute money for his honour and for his monuments of their own free will.\n And that this may be most easily understood, ask any one you please of the witnesses\n whom I shall produce, who are witnesses from Sicily , whether a Roman citizen or a Sicilian, and one too who\n appears most hostile to you, who says that he has been plundered by you, whether he\n contributed anything in his own name to the statue? You will not find one man to\n deny it In truth they all contributed. \n ",
                "152":"\n Do you think then that any one will doubt that he who ought to be most hostile to\n you, who has received the severest injuries from you, paid money on account of a\n statue to you because he was compelled by violence and authoritative command, not\n out of kindness and by his own free will? And I have neither counted up, nor been\n able to count, O judges, the amount of this money, which is very large, and which\n has been most shamelessly extorted from unwilling men, so as to estimate how much\n was extorted from agriculturists, how much from traders who trade at Syracuse , at Agrigentum , at Panormus , at Lilybaeum ; since\n you see by even his own confession that it was extorted from most unwilling\n contributors. \n ",
                "153":"\n I come now to the cities of Sicily , in\n which case it is exceedingly easy to form an opinion of their inclination. Did the\n Sicilians also contribute against their will? It is not probable. In truth it is\n evident that Caius Verres so conducted himself during his praetorship in Sicily , that, as he could not satisfy both parties,\n both the Sicilians and the Romans, he considered rather his duty to our allies, than\n his ambition, which might have prompted him to gratify the citizens. And therefore I\n saw him called in an inscription at Syracuse , not only the patron of that island, but also the saviour of\n it. What a great expression is this! so great that it cannot be expressed by any\n single Latin word. He in truth is a saviour, who has given salvation. In his name\n days of festival are kept—that fine Verrean festival—not as if it was the festival\n of Marcellus, but instead of the Marcellean festival, which they abolished at his\n command. His triumphal arch is in the forum at Syracuse , on which his son stands, naked; and he himself from\n horseback looks down on the province which has been stripped bare by himself. His\n statues are in every place; which seem to show this, that he very nearly erected as\n many statues at Syracuse as he had\n taken away from it. And even at Rome we\n see an inscription in his honour carved at the foot of the statues, in letters of\n the largest size, “that that were given by the community of Sicily .” Why were they given? How can any one be\n induced to believe that such great honours were paid to him by people against their\n will? \n ",
                "154":"\n Here, too, you must deliberate and consider even much more than you did in the\n case of the agriculturists, what you intend. It is an important matter. Do you wish\n the Sicilians, both in their public and private capacity, to be considered friends\n to you, or enemies? If enemies, what is to become of you? Whither will you free for\n refuge? On what will you depend? Just now you repudiated the greater part of the\n agriculturists, most honourable and wealthy men, both Sicilians and Roman citizens.\n Now, what will you do about the Sicilian cities? Will you say that the Sicilians are\n friendly to you? How can you say so? They who (though they have never done such a\n thing in the instance of any one else before, as to give public evidence against\n him, even though many men who have been praetors in that province have been\n condemned, and only two, who have been prosecuted, have been acquitted)—they, I say,\n who now come with letters, with commissions, with public testimonies against you,\n while, if they were to utter a panegyric on you in behalf of their state, they would\n appear to do so according to their usual custom, rather than because of your\n deserts. When these men make a public complaint of your actions, do they not show\n this that your injuries have been so great that they preferred to depart from their\n ancient habit, rather than not speak of your habits? \n ",
                "155":"\n You must, therefore, inevitably confess that the Sicilians are hostile to you;\n since they have addressed to the consuls petitions of the gravest moment directed\n against you, and have entreated me to undertake this cause, and the advocacy of\n their safety; since, though they were forbidden to come by the praetor, and hindered\n by four quaestors, they still have thought every one's threats and every danger\n insignificant, in comparison with their safety; since at the former pleading they\n gave their evidence so earnestly and so bitterly, that Hortensius said that Artemo,\n the deputy of Centuripa, end the witness authorized by the public council there, was\n an accuser, not a witness. In truth he, together with Andron, a most honourable and\n trustworthy man, both on account of his virtue and integrity, and also on account of\n his eloquence, was appointed by his fellow-citizens as their deputy in order that he\n might be able to explain in the most intelligible and clear manner the numerous and\n various injuries which they have sustained from Verres. The people of Halesa, of Catana , of Tyndaris , of Enna , of\n Herbita, of Agyrium , of Netum , of Segesta, gave evidence also. It is\n needless to enumerate them all. You know how many gave evidence, and how many things\n they proved at the former pleading. Now both they and the rest shall give their\n evidence. \n ",
                "156":"\n Every one, in short, shall be made aware of this fact in this cause,—that the\n feelings of the Sicilians are such, that if that man be not punished, they think\n that they must leave their habitations and their homes and depart from Sicily , and flee to some distant land. Will you\n persuade us that these men contributed large sums of money to confer honour and\n dignity on you of their own free will? I suppose, forsooth, they who did not like\n you to remain in safety in your own city, wished to have memorials of your person\n and name in their own cities! The facts show that they wished it. For I have been\n for some time thinking that I was handling the argument about the inclination of the\n Sicilians towards you too tenderly, as to whether they were desirous to erect\n statues to you, or were compelled to do so. \n ",
                "157":"\n What man ever lived of whom such a thing was heard as has happened to you, that\n his statues in his province, erected in the public places, and some of them even in\n the holy temples, were thrown down by force by the whole population? There have been\n many guilty magistrates in Asia , many in\n Africa , many in Spain , in Gaul , in Sardinia , many in\n Sicily itself, but did we ever hear such\n a thing as this of any of them? It is an unexampled thing, O judges, a sort of\n prodigy amazing the Sicilians, and among all the Greeks. I would not have believed\n that story about the statues, if I had not seen them myself uprooted and lying on\n the ground; because it is a custom among all the Greeks to think that honours paid\n to men by monuments of that sort, are, to some extent, consecrated, and under the\n protection of the gods. \n ",
                "158":"\n Therefore, when the Rhodians, almost single-handed, carried on the first war\n against Mithridates, and withstood all his power and his most vigorous attacks on\n their walls, and shores, and fleets,—when they, beyond all other nations, were\n enemies to the king; still, even then, at the time of imminent danger to their city,\n they did not touch his statue which was among them in the most frequented place in\n their city. Perhaps there might seem some inconsistency in preserving the effigy and\n image of the man, when they were striving to overthrow the man himself: but still I\n saw, when I was among them, that they had a religious feeling in those matters\n handed down to them from their ancestors, and that they argued in this way;—that as\n to the statue, they regarded the period when it had been erected; but as to the man,\n they regarded the fact of his waging war against them, and being an enemy.\n You see, therefore,\n that the custom and religious feeling of the Greeks, which is accustomed to defend\n the monuments of enemies, even at a time of actual war, could not, even in a time of\n profound peace, protect the statues of a praetor of the Roman people. \n ",
                "159":"\n The men of Tauromenium which is a\n city in alliance with us, most\n quiet men, who were formerly as far removed as possible from the injuries of our\n magistrates, owing to the protection the treaty was to them; yet even they did not\n hesitate to overturn that man's statue. But when that was removed, they allowed the\n pedestal to remain in the forum, because they thought it would tell more strongly\n against him, if men knew that his statue had been thrown down by the Tauromenians,\n than if they thought that none had ever been erected. The men of Tyndarus threw down\n his statue in the forum; and for the same reason left the horse without a rider. At\n Leontini, even in that miserable and desolate city, his statue in the gymnasium was\n thrown down. For why should I speak of the Syracusans, when that act was not a\n private act of the Syracusans, but was done by them in common with all their\n neighbouring allies, and withal most the whole province? How great a multitude, how\n vast a concourse of men is said to have been present when his statues were pulled\n down and overturned! But where was this done? In the most frequented and sacred\n place of the whole city; before Serapis himself, in the very entrance and vestibule\n of the temple. And if Metellus had not acted with great vigour, and by his\n authority, and by a positive edict forbidden it, there would not have been a trace\n of a statue of that man left in all Sicily .\n \n ",
                "160":"\n And I am not afraid of any of these things seeming to have\n been done in consequence of my arrival, much less in consequence of my instigation.\n All those things were done, not only before I arrived in Sicily , but before he reached Italy . While I was in Sicily , no statue was thrown down. Hear now what was done after I\n departed from thence. The\n senate of Centuripa decreed, and the people ordered, that the quaestors should issue\n a contract for taking down whatever statues there were of Caius Verres himself, of\n his father, and of his son; and that while such demolition was being executed, there\n should be not less than thirty senators present. Remark the soberness and dignity of\n that city. They neither chose that those statues should remain in their city which\n they themselves had given against their will, under the pressure of authority and\n violence; nor the statues of that man, against whom they themselves (a thing which\n they never did before) had sent by a public vote commissions and deputies, with the\n most weighty testimony, to Rome . And they\n thought that it would be a more important thing if it seemed to have been done by\n public authority, than by the violence of the multitude. \n ",
                "161":"\n When, in pursuance of this design, the people of Centuripa had publicly destroyed\n his statues, Metellus hears of it. He is very indignant; he summons before him the\n magistrates of Centuripa and the ten principal citizens. He threatens them with\n measures of great severity, if they do not replace the statues. They report the\n matter to the senate. The statues, which could do no good to his cause, are\n replaced; the decrees of the people of Centuripa, which had been passed concerning\n the statues, are not taken away. Here I can excuse some of the actors. I cannot at\n all excuse Metellus, a wise man, if he acts foolishly. What? did he think it would\n look like a crime in Verres, if his statues were thrown down, a thing which is often\n done by the wind, or by some accident? There could be in such a fact as that no\n charge against the man, no reproof of him Whence, then, does the charge and\n accusation arise? From the intention and will of the people by whom it was\n caused. \n ",
                "162":"\n I, if Metellus had not compelled the men of Centuripa to replace the statues,\n should say, “See, O judges, what exceeding and bitter indignation the injuries of\n that man have implanted in the minds of our allies and friends; when that most\n friendly and faithful city of Centuripa, which is, connected with the Roman people\n by so many reciprocal good offices, that it has not only always loved our republic,\n but has also shown its attachment to the very name of Roman in the person of every\n private individual, has decided by public resolution and by the public authority\n that the statues of Caius Verres ought not to exist in it.” I should recite the\n decrees of the people of Centuripa; I should extol that city, as with the greatest\n truth I might; I should relate that ten thousand of those citizens, the bravest and\n most faithful of our allies,—that every one of the whole people resolved, that there\n ought to be no monument of that man in their city. I should say this if Metellus had\n not replaced the statues. \n ",
                "163":"\n I should now wish to ask of Metellus himself, whether by his power and authority\n he has at all weakened my speech? I think the very same language is still\n appropriate. For, even if the statues were ever so much thrown down, I could not\n show them to you on the ground. This only statement could I use, that so wise a city\n had decided that the statues of Caius Verres ought to be demolished. And this\n argument Metellus has not taken from me. He has even given me this additional one;\n he has enabled me to complain, if I thought fit, that authority is exercised over\n our friends and allies with so much injustice, that, even in the services they do\n people, they are not allowed to use their own unbiased judgment; he has enabled me\n to entreat you to form your conjectures, how you suppose Lucius Metellus behaved to\n me in those matters in which he was able to injure me, when he behaved with such\n palpable partiality in this one in which he could be no hindrance to me. But I am\n not angry with Metellus, nor do I wish to rob him of his excuse which he puts forth\n to every one, that he did nothing spitefully nor with any especial design. \n ",
                "164":"\n Now, therefore, it is so evident that you cannot deny it, that no statue was given\n to you with the good will of any one; no money on account of statues, that was not\n squeezed out and extorted by force. And, in making that charge, I do not wish that\n alone to be understood, that you get money to the amount of a hundred and twenty\n thousand sesterces ; but much more do I wish to have\n this point seen clearly, which was proved at the same time, namely, how great both\n is and was the hatred borne to you by the agriculturists, and by all the Sicilians.\n And as to this point, what your defence is to be I cannot guess.— \n ",
                "165":"\n “Yes, the Sicilians hate me, because I did a great deal for the sake of the Roman\n citizens.” But they too are most bitter against you, and most hostile. “I have the\n Roman citizens for my enemies, because I defended the interests and rights of the\n allies.” But the allies complain that they were considered and treated by you as\n enemies. “The agriculturists are hostile to me on account of the tenths.” Well; they\n who cultivate land untaxed and free from this impost; why do they hate you? why do\n the men of Halesa, of Centuripa, of Segesta, of Halicya hate you? What race of men,\n what number of men, what rank of men can you name that does not hate you, whether\n they be Roman citizens or Sicilians? So that even if I could not give a reason for\n their hating you, still I should think that the fact ought to be mentioned and that\n you also O judges, ought to hate the man whom all men hate. \n ",
                "166":"\n Will you dare to say, either that the agriculturists, that all the Sicilians, in\n short, think well of you, or that it has nothing to do with the subject what they\n think? You will not dare to say this, nor if you were to wish to do so would you be\n allowed. For those equestrian statues erected by the Sicilians, whom you affect to\n despise, and by the agriculturists, deprive you of the power of saying that; the\n statues, I mean, which a little while before you came to the city you ordered to be\n erected and to have inscriptions put upon them, to serve as a check to the\n inclinations of all your enemies and accusers. \n ",
                "167":"\n For who would be troublesome to you, or who would dare to bring an action against\n you, when he saw statues erected to you by traders, by agriculturists, by the common\n voice of all Sicily ? What other class of\n men is there in that province?—None. Therefore he is not only loved, but even\n honored by the whole province, and also by each separate portion of it, according to\n their class. Who will dare to touch this man? Can you then say that the evidence of\n agriculturists, of traders, and of all the Sicilians against you, ought to be no\n objection to you, when you hoped to be able to extinguish all your unpopularity and\n infamy by placing their names in an inscription on your statues? Or, if you\n attempted to add honour to your statues by their authority, shall I not be able to\n corroborate my argument by the dignity of those same men? \n ",
                "168":"\n Unless, perchance, in that matter, some little hope still consoles you, because\n you were popular among the farmers of the revenues: but I have taken care, through\n my diligence, that that popularity should not serve,—you have contrived, by your own\n wisdom, to show that it ought to be, an injury to you. Listen, O judges, to the\n whole affair in a few words. In the collecting the tax on pasture lands in Sicily there is a sub-collector of the name of\n Lucius Carpinatius, who both for the sake of his own profit, and perhaps because he\n thought it for the interest of his partners, cultivated the favour of Verres to the\n neglect of everything else. He, while he was attending the praetor about all the\n markets, and never leaving him, had got into such familiarity with, and aptitude at\n the practice of selling Verres's decrees and decisions, and managing his other\n concerns, that he was considered almost a second Timarchides. \n ",
                "169":"\n He was in one respect still more important; because he also lent money at usury to\n those who were purchasing anything of the praetor. And this usury, O judges, was\n such that even the profit from the other transactions was inferior to the gain\n obtained by it. For the money which he entered as paid to those with whom he was\n dealing, he entered also under the name of Verres's secretary, or of Timarchides, or\n even under Verres's own name, as received from them. And besides that, he lent other\n large sums belonging to Verres, of which he made no entry at all, in his own name.\n \n ",
                "170":"\n Originally this Carpinatius, before he had become so intimate with Verres, had\n often written letters to the shareholders about his unjust actions. But Canuleius,\n who had an agency at Syracuse , in the\n harbour, had also written accounts to his shareholders of many of Verres's\n robberies, giving instances, especially, concerning things which had been exported\n from Syracuse without paying the\n harbour dues. But the same company was farming both the harbour dues and the taxes\n on pasture land. And thus it happened that there were many things which we could\n state and produce against Verres from the letters of that company. \n ",
                "171":"\n But it happened that Carpinatius, who had by this time become connected with him\n by the greatest intimacy, and also by community of interests, afterwards sent\n frequent letters to his partners, speaking of his exceeding kindness, and of his\n services to their common property. And in truth, as he was used to do and to decree\n everything which Carpinatius requested him, Carpinatius also began to write still\n more flaming accounts to his shareholders, in order, if possible, utterly to efface\n the recollection of all that he had written before. But at last, when Verres was\n departing, he sent letters to them, to beg them to go out in crowds to meet him and\n to give him thanks; and to promise zealously that they would do whatever he desired\n them. And the shareholders did so, according to the old custom of farmers; not\n because they thought him deserving of any honour, but because they thought it was\n for their own interest to be thought to remember kindness, and to be grateful for\n it. They expressed their thanks to him, and said that Carpinatius had often sent\n letters to them mentioning his good offices. \n ",
                "172":"\n When he had made answer that he had done those things gladly, and had greatly\n extolled the services of Carpinatius, he charges a friend of his, who at that time\n was the chief collector of that company, to take care diligently, and to make sure\n that there was nothing in any of the letters of any of the partners which could tell\n against his safety and reputation. Accordingly he, having got rid of the main body\n of the shareholders, summons the collectors of the tenths, and communicates the\n business to them. They resolve and determine that those letters in which any attack\n was made on the character of Caius Verres shall be removed, and that care he taken\n that that business shall not by any possibility be any injury to Caius Verres. \n ",
                "173":"\n If I prove that the collectors of the truths passed this resolution,—if I make it\n evident that, according to this decree, the letters were removed, what more would\n you wait for? Can I produce to you any affair more absolutely decided? Can I bring\n before your tribunal any criminal more fully condemned? But condemned by whose\n judgment? By that, forsooth, of those men whom they who wish for severe tribunals\n think ought to decide on causes,—by the judgment of the farmers, whom the people is\n now demanding to have for judges, and concerning whom, that we may have them for\n judges, we at this moment see a law proposed, not by a man of our body, not by a man\n born of the equestrian order, not by a man of the noblest birth: \n ",
                "174":"\n the collectors of the tenths, that is to say, the chiefs, and, as it were, the\n senators of the farmers, voted that these letters should be removed out of sight. I\n have men, who were present, whom I can produce, to whom I will entrust this proof,\n most honourable and wealthy men, the very chief of the equestrian order, on whose\n high credit the very speech and cause of the man who has proposed this law mainly\n relies. They shall come before you; they shall say what they deter mined. Indeed, if\n I know the men properly, they will not speak falsely For they were able, indeed, to\n put letters to their community out of sight; they have not been able to put out of\n sight their own good faith and conscientiousness. Therefore the Roman knights, who\n condemned you by their judgment, have not been willing to be condemned in the\n judgment of those judges. Do you now consider whether you prefer to follow their\n decision or their inclination. \n ",
                "175":"\n But see now, how far the zeal of your friends, your own devices, and the\n inclination of those partners aid you. I will speak a little more openly; for I am\n not afraid of any one thinking that I am saying this in the spirit of an accuser\n rather than with proper freedom. If the collectors had not removed those letters\n according to the resolution of the farmers of the tenths, I could only say against\n you what I had found in those letters; but now that the resolution has been passed,\n and the letters have been removed, I may say whatever I can, and the judge may\n suspect whatever he chooses. I say that you exported from Syracuse an immense weight of gold, of silver,\n of ivory, of purple; much cloth from Melita , much embroidered stuff, much furniture of Delos , many Corinthian vessels, a great quantity\n of corn, an immense load of honey; and that on account of these things, because no\n port dues were paid on them, Lucius Canuleius, who was the agent in the harbour,\n sent letters to his partners. Does this appear a\n sufficiently grave charge? \n ",
                "176":"\n None, I think, can be graver. What will Hortensius say in defence? Will he demand\n that I produce the letters of Canuleius? Will he say that a charge of this sort is\n worthless unless it be supported by letters? I shall cry out that the letters have\n been put out of the way; that by a resolution of the shareholders the proofs and\n evidences of his thefts have been taken from me. He must either contend that this\n has not been done, or he must bear the brunt of all my weapons. Do you deny that\n this was done? I am glad to hear that defence. I descend into the arena; for equal\n terms and an equal contest are before us. I will produce witnesses, and I will\n produce many at the same time; since they were together when this took place, they\n shall be together now also. When they are examined, let them be bound not only by\n the obligation of their oath and regard for their character, but also by a common\n consciousness of the truth. \n ",
                "177":"\n If it be proved that this did take place as I say it did, will you be able to say,\n O Hortensius, that there was nothing in those letters to hurt Verres? You not only\n will not say so, but you will not even be able to say this,—that there was not as\n much in them as I say there was. This then is what you have brought about by your\n wisdom and by your interest; that, as I said a little while ago, you have given me\n the greatest licence for accusing, and he judges the most ample liberty to believe\n anything. \n ",
                "178":"\n But though this be the case, still I will invent nothing. I will recollect that I\n have not taken a criminal to accuse, but that I have received clients to defend; and\n that you ought to hear the cause not as it might be produced by me, but as it has\n been brought to me; that I shall satisfy the Sicilians, if I diligently set forth\n what I have known myself in Sicily , and\n what I have heard from them; that I shall satisfy the Roman people, if I fear\n neither the violence nor the influence of any one; that I shall satisfy you, if by\n my good faith and diligence I give you an opportunity of deciding correctly and\n honestly; that I shall satisfy myself, if I do not depart a hair's breadth from that\n course of life which I have proposed to myself. \n ",
                "179":"\n Wherefore, you have no ground to fear that I will invent anything against you. You\n have cause even to be glad; for I shall pass over many things which I know to have\n been done by you, because they are either too infamous, or scarcely credible. I will\n only discuss this whole affair of this society. That you may now hear the truth, I\n will ask, Was such a resolution passed? When I have ascertained that, I will ask,\n Have the letters been removed? When that too, is proved , you will understand the\n matter, even if I say nothing. If they who passed this resolution for his\n sake—namely, the Roman knights—were now also judges in his case, they would beyond\n all question condemn that man, concerning whom they knew that letters which laid\n bare his robberies had been sent to themselves, and had been removed by their own\n resolution. He, therefore, who must have been condemned by those Roman knights who\n desire everything to turn out for his interest, and who have been most kindly\n treated by him, can he, O judges, by any possible means or contrivance be acquitted\n by you? \n ",
                "180":"\n And that you may not suppose that those things which have\n been removed out of the way, and taken from you, were all so carefully hidden, and\n kept so secretly, that with all the diligence which I am aware is universally\n expected of me nothing concerning them has been able to be arrived at or discovered,\n I must tell you that, whatever could by any means or contrivance be found out, has\n been found out, O judges. You shall see in a moment the man detected in the very\n act; for as I have spent a great part of my life in attending to the causes of\n farmers, and have paid great attention to that body, I think that I am sufficiently\n acquainted with their customs by experience and by intercourse with them. \n ",
                "181":"\n Therefore, when I ascertained that the letters of the company were removed out of\n the way, I made a calculation of the years that that man had been in Sicily ; then I inquired (what was exceedingly easy\n to discover) who during those years had been the collectors of that company,—in\n whose care the records had been. For I was aware that it was the custom of the\n collectors who kept the records, when they gave them up to the new collector, to\n retain copies of the documents themselves. And therefore I went in the first place\n to Lucius Vibius, a Roman knight, a man of the highest consideration, who, I\n ascertained, had been collector that very year about which I particularly had to\n inquire. I came upon the man unexpectedly when he was thinking of other things. I\n investigated what I could, and inquired into everything. I found only two small\n books, which had been sent by Lucius Canuleius to the shareholders from the harbour\n at Syracuse ; in which there was\n entered an account of many months, and of things exported in Verres's name without\n having paid harbour dues. These I sealed up immediately. \n ",
                "182":"\n These were documents of that sort which of all the papers of the company I was most\n anxious to find; but still I only found enough, O judges, to produce to you as a\n sample, as it were. But still, whatever is in these books, however unimportant it\n may seem to be, will at all events be undeniable; and by this you will be able to\n form your conjectures as to the rest. Read for me, I beg, this first book, and then\n the other. [The books of Canuleius are read.] I do not ask now whence you got those\n four hundred jars of honey, or such quantities of Maltese cloth, or fifty cushions\n for sofas or so many candelabra;—I do not, I say, inquire at present where you got\n these things; but, how you could want such a quantity of them, that I do ask. I say\n nothing about the honey; but what could you want with so many Maltese garments? as\n if you were going to dress all your friends' wives;—or with so many sofa cushions?\n as if you were going to furnish all their villas. \n ",
                "183":"\n As in these little books there are only the accounts of a few months, conjecture\n in your minds what they must have been for the whole three years. This is what I\n contend for. From these small books found in the house of one collector of the\n company, you can form some conjecture how great a robber that man was in that\n province; what a number of desires, what different ones, what countless ones he\n indulged; what immense sums he made not only in money, but invested also in articles\n of this sort; which shall be detailed to you more fully another time. At present\n listen to this. \n ",
                "184":"\n By these exportations, of which the list was read to you, he writes that the\n shareholders had lost sixty thousand sesterces by\n the five per cent due on them as harbour dues at Syracuse . In a few months, therefore, as these little insignificant\n books show, things were stolen by the praetor and exported from one single town of\n the value of twelve hundred thousand sesterces .\n Think now, as the island is one which is accessible by sea on all sides, what you\n can suppose was exported from other places? from Agrigentum , from Lilybaeum ,\n from Panormus , from Thermae, from\n Halesa, from Catina , from the other towns?\n And what from Messana ? the place which he\n thought safe for his purpose above all others,—where he was always easy and\n comfortable in his mind, because he had selected the Mamertines as men to whom he\n could send everything which was either to be preserved carefully, or exported\n secretly. After these books had been found, the rest were removed and concealed more\n carefully; but we, that all men may see that we are acting without any ulterior\n motive, are content with these books which we have produced. \n ",
                "185":"\n Now we will return to the accounts of the society of money received and paid,\n which they could not possibly remove honestly, and to your friend Carpinatius. We\n inspected at Syracuse accounts of the\n company made up by Carpinatius, which showed by many items that many of the men who\n had paid money to Verres, had borrowed it of Carpinatius. That will be clearer than\n daylight to you, O judges, when I produce the very men who paid the money; for you\n will see that the times at which, as they were in danger, they bought themselves\n off, agree with the records of the company not only as to the years, but even as to\n the months. \n ",
                "186":"\n While we were examining this matter thoroughly, and\n holding the documents actually in our hands, we see on a sudden erasures of such a\n sort as to appear to be fresh wounds inflicted on papers. Immediately, having a\n suspicion of something wrong, we bent our eyes and attention on the names\n themselves. Money was entered as having been received from Caius Verrutius the son\n of Caius, in such a way that the letters had been let stand down to the second R,\n all the rest was an erasure. A second, a third, a fourth—there were a great many\n names in the same state. As the matter was plain, so also was the abominable and\n scandalous worthlessness of the accounts. We began to inquire of Carpinatius who\n that Verrutius was, with whom he had such extensive pecuniary dealings. The man\n began to hesitate, to look away, to colour. Because there is a provision made by law\n with respect to the accounts of the farmers, forbidding their being taken to\n Rome ; in order that the matter might be\n as clear and as completely proved as possible, I summon Carpinatius before the\n tribunal of Metellus and produce the accounts of the company in the forum. There is\n a great rush of people to the place; and as the partnership existing between\n Carpinatius and that praetor, and his usury, were well known, all people were\n watching with the most eager expectation to see what was contained in the accounts\n \n ",
                "187":"\n I bring the matter before Metellus; I state to him that I have seen the accounts\n of the shareholders, that in these there is a long account of one Caius Verrutius\n made up of many items, and that I saw, by a computation of the years and months,\n that this Verrutius had had no account at all with Carpinatius, either before the\n arrival of Caius Verres, or after his departure. I demand that Carpinatius shall\n give me an answer who that Verrutius is; whether he is a merchant, or a broker, or\n an agriculturist, or a grazier; whether he is in Sicily , or whether he has now left it. All who were in the court\n cried out at once that there had never been any one in Sicily of the name of Verrutius. I began to press the man to answer\n me who he was, where he was, whence he came; why the servant of the company who made\n up the accounts always made a blunder in the name of Verrutius at the same place?\n \n ",
                "188":"\n And I made this demand, not because I thought it of any consequence that he should\n be compelled to answer me these things against his will, but that the robberies of\n one, the dishonesty of the other, and the audacity of both might be made evident to\n all the world. And so I leave him in the court, dumb from fear and the consciousness\n of his crimes, terrified out of his wits, and almost frightened to death; I take a\n copy of the accounts in the forum, with a great crowd of men standing round me; the\n most eminent men in the assembly are employed in making the copy; the letters and\n the erasures are faithfully copied and imitated, and transferred from the accounts\n into books. \n ",
                "189":"\n \n The copy was examined and compared with the original with\n the greatest care and diligence, and then sealed up by most honourable men. If\n Carpinatius would not answer me then, do you, O Verres, answer me now, who you\n imagine this Verrutius, who must almost be one of your own family, to be. It is\n quite impossible that you should not have known a man in your own province, who, I\n see, was in Sicily while you were praetor,\n and who, I perceive from the accounts themselves, was a very wealthy man. And now,\n that this may not be longer in obscurity, advance into the middle, open the volume, the copy of the accounts,\n so that every one may be able to see now, not the traces only of that man's avarice,\n but the very bed in which it lay. \n ",
                "190":"\n You see the word Verrutius ?—You see the first\n letters untouched? you see the last part of the name, the tail of Verres, smothered\n in the erasure, as in the mud. The original accounts, O judges, are in exactly the\n same state as this copy.—What are you waiting for? What more do you want? You,\n Verres, why are you sitting there? Why do you delay? for either you must show us\n Verrutius, or confess that you yourself are Verrutius. The ancient orators are\n extolled, the Crassi and Antonii, because they had the skill to efface the\n impression made by an accusation with great clearness, and to defend the causes of\n accused persons with eloquence. It was not, forsooth, in ability only that they\n surpassed those who are now employed here as counsel, but also in good fortune. No\n one, in those times, committed such crimes as to leave no room for any defence; no\n one lived in such a manner that no part of his life was free from the most extreme\n infamy; no one was detected in such manifest guilt, that, shameless as he had been\n in the action, he seemed still more shameless if he denied it. \n ",
                "191":"\n But now what can Hortensius do? Can he argue against the\n charges of avarice by panegyrics on his client's economy? He is defending a man\n thoroughly profligate, thoroughly licentious, thoroughly wicked. Can he lead your\n attention away from this infamy and profligacy of his, and turn them into some other\n direction by a mention of his bravery? But a man more inactive, more lazy, one who\n is more a man among women, a debauched woman among men, cannot be found.—But his\n manners are affable. Who is more obstinate more rude? more arrogant?—But still all\n this is without any injury to any one. Who has ever been more furious, more\n treacherous, and more cruel? With such a defendant and such a cause, what could all\n the Crassus's and Antonius's in the world do? This is all they would do, as I think,\n O Hortensius; they would have nothing to do with the cause at all, lest by contact\n with the impudence of another they might lose their own characters for virtue. For\n they come to plead causes free and unshackled, so as not, if they did not choose to\n act shamelessly in defending people, to be thought ungrateful for abandoning\n them. \n "

                "2":"\n And, therefore, O judges, that most illustrious and most eloquent man, Lucius\n Crassus, was often heard to say that he did not repent of anything so much as having\n ever proceeded against Caius Carbo: for by so doing he had his inclination as to\n everything less uncontrolled, and he thought, too, that his way of life was remarked\n by more people than he liked. And he, fortified as he was by the protection of his\n own genius and fortune, was yet hampered by this anxiety which he had brought upon\n himself, before his judgment was fully formed, at his entrance into life; on which\n account virtue and integrity is less, looked for from those who undertake this\n business as young men, than from those who do so at a riper age; for they, for the\n sake of credit and ostentation, become accusers of others before they have had time\n to take notice how much more free the life of those who have accused no one is.

Have you accused any thief or rapacious man? You\n must for ever avoid all suspicion of avarice. Have you prosecuted any spiteful or\n cruel man? You must for ever take care not to appear in any matter the least harsh\n or severe. A seducer? an adulterer? You must, take care most diligently that no\n trace of licentiousness be ever seen in your conduct. In short, everything which you\n have impeached in another must be earnestly avoided by you your self.

Do you think there is any greater enmity than that arising from the\n opposite opinions of men, and the contrariety of their wishes and inclinations? Can\n he who thinks good faith the holiest thing in life avoid being an enemy to that man\n who, as quaestor, dared to despoil, to desert, to betray, and to attack his consul,\n whose counsels he had shared, whose money he had received, with all whose business\n affairs he had been entrusted? Can he who reverences modesty and chastity behold\n with equanimity the daily adulteries, the dissolute manners of that man, the\n domestic pandering to his passions?

I, who above all other men ought to undertake, to gratify the\n desires of the Roman people, even a greater burden and duty than my strength perhaps\n is equal to. What? cannot\n even those matters, which seem more trifling, move any one's mind,—that the\n worthlessness and audacity of that man should have a more easy access to your own\n friendship, O Hortensius, and to that of other great and noble men, than the virtue\n and integrity of any one of us?

It cannot escape\n the notice of any one of you, O judges, that all the advantage and desirableness of\n Sicily , which is in any way connected\n with the convenience of the Roman people, consists mainly in its corn; for in other\n respects we are indeed assisted by that province, but as to this article, we are fed\n and supported by it. \n ",
                "11":"\n The case, O judges, will be divided under three heads in my accusation: for,\n first, I shall speak of the collectors of the tenths; secondly, of the corn which\n has been bought; thirdly, of that which has been valued. There is, O judges, this difference\n between Sicily and other provinces, in the matter of tribute derived from the lands;\n that in the other provinces, either the tribute imposed is of a fixed amount, which\n is called stipendiarium , as in the case of the\n Spaniards and most of the Carthaginian provinces, being a sort of reward of victory,\n and penalty for war; or else a contract exists between the state and the farmers,\n settled by the censor, as is the case in Asia , by the Sempronian law. But the cities in Sicily were received into our friendship and\n alliance, retaining the same laws which they had before, and that being subject to\n the Roman people on the same conditions as they had formerly been subject to their\n own princes. \n ",
                "12":"\n Very few cities of Sicily were subdued in\n war by our ancestors, and even in the case of those which were, though their land\n was made the public domain of the Roman people, still it was afterwards restored to\n them. That domain is regularly let out to farmers by the censors. There are two\n federate cities, whose tenths are not put up to auction; the city of the Mamertines\n and Taurominium. Besides these, there are five cities without any treaty, free and\n enfranchised; Centuripa, Halesa, Segesta, Halicya, and Panormus . All the land of the other states of\n Sicily is subject to the payment of\n tenths; and was so, before the sovereignty of the Roman people, by the will and laws\n of the Sicilians themselves. \n ",
                "13":"\n See now the wisdom of our ancestors, who, when they had added Sicily , so valuable an assistant both in war and\n peace, to the republic, were so careful to defend the Sicilians and to retain them\n in their allegiance, that they not only imposed no new tax upon their lands, but did\n not even alter the law of putting up for sale the contracts of the farmers of the\n tenths, or the time or place of selling them; so that they were to put them up for\n sale at the regular time of year, at the same place, in Sicily ,—in short, in every respect as the law of Hiero directed; they\n permitted them still to manage their own affairs, and were not willing that their\n minds should be disturbed even by a new name to a law, much less by an actual new\n law. \n ",
                "14":"\n And so that resolved that the farming of the tenth should always be put up to\n auction according to the law of Hiero, in order that the discharge of that office\n might be the more agreeable if, though the supreme power was changed, still, not\n only the laws of that king who was very dear to the Sicilians, but his name also\n remained in force among them. This law the Sicilians always used before Verres was\n praetor. He first dared to root up and alter the established usages of them all,\n their customs which had been handed down to them from their ancestors, the\n conditions of their friendship with us, and the rights secured to them by our\n alliance. \n ",
                "15":"\n And in this, this is the first thing I object to and accuse you for, that in a\n custom of such long standing, and so thoroughly established, you made any innovation\n at all. Have you ever gained anything by this genius of yours? Were you superior in\n prudence and wisdom to so many wise and illustrious men who governed that province\n before you? That is your renown; this praise is due to your genius and diligence. I\n admit and grant this to you. I do know that, at Rome , when you were praetor, you did transfer by your edict the\n possession of inheritance from the children to strangers, from the first heirs to\n the second, from the laws to your own licentious covetousness. I do know that you\n corrected the edicts of all your predecessors, and gave possession of inheritance\n not according to the evidence of those who produced the will, but according to\n theirs who said that a will had been made. And I do know too that those new\n practices, first brought forward and invented by you, were a very great profit to\n you. I recollect, moreover, that you also abrogated and altered the laws of the\n censors about the keeping the public buildings in repair; so that he might not take\n the contract to whom the care of the building belonged; so that his guardians and\n relations might not consult the advantage, of their ward so as to prevent his being\n stripped of all his property; that you appointed a very limited time for the work,\n in order to exclude others from the business; but that with respect to the\n contractor you favoured, you did not observe any fixed time at all. \n ",
                "16":"\n So that I do not marvel at your having established a new law in the matter of the\n tenths you, a man so wise, so thoroughly practiced in praetorian edicts and\n censorian laws. I do not wonder, I say, at your having invented something; but I do\n blame you, I do impeach you, for having of your own accord, without any command from\n the people, without the authority of the senate, changed the laws of the province of\n Sicily . \n ",
                "17":"\n The senate permitted Lucius Octavius and Caius Cotta, the consuls, to put up to\n auction at Rome the tenths of wine, and\n oil, and of pulse, which before your time the quaestors had been in the habit of\n putting up in Sicily ; and to establish any\n law with respect to those articles which they might think fit. When the contract was\n offered for sale, the farmers begged them to add some clauses to the law, and yet\n not to depart from the other laws of the censors. A man opposed this, who by\n accident was at Rome at that time; your\n host,—your host, and intimate friend, I say, O Verres,—Sthenius, of Thermae, who is\n here present The consuls examined into the matter. When they had summoned many of\n the principal and most honourable men of the state to form a council on the subject;\n according to the opinion of that council they gave notice that they should put the\n tenths up to auction according to the law of Hiero. \n ",
                "18":"\n Was it not so? Men of the greatest wisdom, invested with the supreme authority, to\n whom the senate had given the whole power of making laws respecting the letting out\n the farming of the tributes, (and this power had been ratified by the people, while\n only one Sicilian objected to it,) would not alter the name of the law of Hiero,\n even when the measure would have been accompanied by an augmentation of the revenue;\n but you, a man of no wisdom, of no authority, without any order from people or\n senate, while all Sicily objected,\n abrogated the whole law of Hiero, to the greatest injury and even destruction of the\n revenue. \n ",
                "19":"\n But what law is this, O judges, which he amends, or rather totally abrogates? A\n law framed with the greatest acuteness and the greatest diligence, which gives up\n the cultivator of the land to the collector of the tenths, guarded by so many\n securities, that neither in the corn fields, nor on the threshing floors, nor in the\n barns, nor while removing his corn privately, nor while carrying it away openly, can\n the cultivator defraud the collector of one single grain without the severest\n punishment. The law has been framed with such care, that it is plain that a man\n framed it who had no other revenues; with such acuteness that it was plain that he\n was a Sicilian; with such severity, that he was evidently a tyrant: by this law,\n however, cultivating the land was an advantageous trade for the Sicilian; for the\n laws for the collectors of the tenths were also drawn up so carefully that it is not\n possible for more than the tenth to be extorted from the cultivator against his\n will. \n ",
                "20":"\n And though all these things were settled in this way, after so many years and even\n ages, Verres was found not only to change, but entirely to overturn them, and to\n convert to purposes of his own most infamous profit those regulations which had long\n ago been instituted and established for the safety of the allies and the benefit of\n the republic. In the first instance he appointed certain men, collectors of the\n tenths in name, in reality the ministers and satellites of his desires; by whom I\n will show that the province was for three years so harassed and plundered, O judges,\n that it will take many years and a long series of wise and incorruptible governors\n to recover it. \n ",
                "21":"\n The chief of all those who were called collectors, was Quintus Apronius, that man\n whom you see in court, concerning whose extraordinary wickedness you have heard the\n complaints of most influential deputations. Look, O judges, at the face and\n countenance of the man; and from that obstinacy which he retains now in the most\n desperate circumstances, you may imagine and recollect what his arrogance must have\n been in Sicily . This Apronius is the man\n whom Verres (though he had collected together the most infamous men from all\n quarters, and though he had taken with him no small number of men like himself in\n worthlessness, licentiousness, and audacity,) still considered most like himself of\n any man in the whole province. And so in a very short time they became intimate, not\n because of interest, nor of reason, nor of any introduction from mutual friends, but\n from the baseness and similarity of their pursuits. \n ",
                "22":"\n You know the depraved and licentious habits of Verres. Imagine to yourselves, if\n you can, any one who can be in every respect equal to him in the wicked and\n dissolute commission of every crimes that man will be Apronius; who, as he shows not\n only by his life, but by his person and countenance, is a vast gulf and whirlpool of\n every sort of vice and infamy. Him did Verres employ as his chief agent in all his\n adulteries, in all his plundering of temples, in all his debauched banquets; and the\n similarity of their manners caused such a friendship and unanimity between them,\n that Apronius, whom every one else thought a boor and a barbarian, appeared to him\n alone an agreeable and an accomplished man; that, though every one else hated him,\n and could not bear the sight of him, Verres could not bear to be away from him;\n that, though others shunned even the banquets at which Apronius was to be presents\n Verres used the same cup with him; lastly, that, though the odour of Apronius's\n breath and person is such that even, as one may say, the beasts cannot endure him,\n he appeared to Verres alone sweet and pleasant. He sat next to him on the\n judgment-seat; he was alone with him in his chamber; he was at the head of his table\n at his banquets; and especially then, when he began to dance at the feast naked,\n while the young son of the praetor was sitting by. \n ",
                "23":"\n This man, as I began to say, Verres selected for his principal agent in\n distressing and plundering the fortunes of the cultivators of the land. To this\n man's audacity, and wickedness, and cruelty, our most faithful allies and most\n virtuous citizens were given up, O judges, by this praetor, and were placed at his\n mercy by new regulations and new edicts, the entire law of Hiero, as I said before,\n having been rejected and repudiated. \n ",
                "24":"\n First of all, listen, O judges, to his splendid edict.\n “Whatever amount of tithe the collector declared that the cultivator ought to pay,\n that amount the cultivator should be compelled to pay to the collector.”—How? Let\n him pay as much as Apronius demands? What is this? is the regulation of a praetor\n for allies, or the edict and command of an insane tyrant to conquered enemies? Am I\n to give as much as he demands? He will demand every grain that I can get out of my\n land. Am I to give all? Yes, and more too, if he chooses. What, then, am I to do?\n What do you think? You must either pay, or you will be convicted of having disobeyed\n the edict. O ye immortal gods, what a state of things is this For it is hardly\n credible. And indeed. \n ",
                "25":"\n I am persuaded, O judges, that, though you should think that all other vices are\n met in this man, still this must seem false to you. For I myself, though all\n Sicily told me of it, still should not\n dare to affirm this to you, if I was not able to recite to you these edicts from his\n own documents in those very words—as I will do. Give this, I pray you, to the clerk;\n he shall read from the register. Read the edict about the returns of property. [The\n edict about the returns of property is read.] He says I am not reading the whole.\n For that is what he seems to intimate by shaking his head. What am I passing over?\n is it that part where you take care of the interests of the Sicilians, and show\n regard for the miserable cultivators? For you announce in your edict, that you will\n condemn the collector in eightfold damages, if he has taken more than was due to\n him. I do not wish anything to be passed over. Read this also which he requires;\n read every word. [The edict about the eightfold damages is read.] Does this mean\n that the cultivator is to prosecute the collector at law? It is a miserable and\n unjust thing for men to be brought from the country into the forum, from the plough\n to the courts of justice; from habits of rustic life to actions and trials to which\n they are wholly unaccustomed. \n ",
                "26":"\n When in all the other countries liable to tribute, of Asia , of Macedonia , of\n Spain , of Gaul , of Africa , of\n Sicily , and in those parts of Italy also which are so liable; when in all these, I\n say, the farmer in every case has a right to claim and a power to distrain, but not\n to seize and take possession without the interference of the law, you established\n regulations respecting the most virtuous and honest and honourable class of\n men,—that is, respecting the cultivators of the soil,—which are contrary to all\n other laws. Which is the most just, for the collector to have to make his claim, or\n for the cultivator to have to recover what has been unlawfully seized? for them to\n go to trial when things are in their original state, or when one side is ruined? for\n him to be in possession of the property who has acquired it by hard labour, or him\n who has obtained it by bidding for it at an auction? What more? They who cultivate\n single acres, who never cease from personal labour, of which class there were a\n great number, and a vast multitude among the Sicilians before you came as\n praetor,—what are they to do? When they have given to Apronius all he has demanded,\n are they to leave their allotments? to leave their own household gods? to come to\n Syracuse , in order while you,\n forsooth, are praetor, to prosecute, by the equal law which they will find there,\n Apronius, the delight and joy of your life, in a suit for recovery of their\n property? \n ",
                "27":"\n But so be it. Some fearless and experienced cultivator will be found, who, when he\n has paid the collector as much as he says is due, will seek to recover it by course\n of law, and will sue for the eightfold penalty. I look for the vigour of the edict,\n for the impartiality of the praetor; I espouse the cause of the cultivator; I wish\n to see Apronius condemned in the eightfold penalty. What now does the cultivator\n demand? Nothing but sentence for an eightfold penalty, according to the edict. What\n says Apronius? He is unable to object. What says the praetor? He bids him challenge\n the judges. Let us, says he, make out the decuries. What decuries? Those from my\n retinue; you will challenge the others. What? of what men is that retinue composed?\n Of Volusius the soothsayer, and Cornelius the physician, and the other dogs whom you\n see licking up the crumbs about my judgment-seat. For he never appointed any judge\n or recuperator from the proper body. He said all men who\n possessed one clod of earth were unfairly prejudiced against the collectors. People\n had to sue Apronius before these men who had not yet got rid of the surfeit from his\n last banquet. What a\n splendid and memorable court! what an impartial decision! what a safe resource for\n the cultivators of the soil! \n ",
                "28":"\n And that you may understand what sort of decisions are obtained in actions for the\n eightfold penalty, and what sort of judges those selected from that man's retinue\n are considered to be, listen to this. Do you think that any collector, when this\n licence was allowed him of taking from the cultivator whatever he claimed, ever did\n demand more than was due? Consider yourselves in your own minds, whether you think\n any one ever did so, especially when it might have happened, not solely through\n covetousness, but even though ignorance. Many must have done so. But I say that all\n extorted more, and a great deal more, than the proper tenths. Tell me of one man, in\n the whole three years of your praetorship, who was condemned in the eightfold\n penalty. Condemned, indeed! Tell me of one man who was ever prosecuted according to\n your edict. There was not, in fact, one cultivator who was able to complain that\n injustice had been done to him; not one collector who claimed one grain more as due\n to him than really was due. Far from that. Apronius seized and carried off whatever\n he chose from every one. In every district the cultivators, harassed and plundered\n as they were, were complaining, and yet no instance of a trial can be found. \n ",
                "29":"\n Why is this? Why did so many bold, honourable, and highly esteemed men—so many\n Sicilians, so many Roman knights—when injured by one most worthless and infamous\n man, not seek to recover the eightfold penalty, which had most unquestionably been\n incurred? What is the cause, what is the reason? That reason alone, O judges, which\n you see,—because they knew they should come off at the trial defrauded and\n ridiculed. In truth, what sort of triad must that be, when three of the profligate\n and abandoned retinue of Verres sat on the tribunal under the name of judges?—slaves\n of Verres, not inherited by him from his father, but recommended to him by his\n mistress. \n ",
                "30":"\n The cultivator, forsooth, might plead his cause; he might show that no corn was\n left him by Apronius,—that even his other property was seized; that he himself had\n been driven away with blows. Those admirable men would lay their heads together,\n they would chat to one another about revels and harlots, if they could catch any\n when leaving the praetor. The cause would seem to be properly heard: Apronius would\n have risen, full of his new dignity as a knight; not like a collector all over dirt\n and dust, but reeking with perfumes, languid with the lateness of the last night's\n drinking party, with his first motion, and with his breath he would have filled the\n whole place with the odour of wine, of perfume, and of his person. He would have\n said, what he repeatedly has said, that he had bought, not the tenths, but the\n property and fortunes of the cultivators; that he, Apronius, was not a collector,\n but a second Verres,—the absolute lord and master of those men. And when he had said\n this, those admirable men of Verres's train, the judges, would deliberate, not about\n acquitting Apronius, but they would inquire how they could condemn the cultivator\n himself to pay damages to Apronius. \n ",
                "31":"\n When you had granted this licence for plundering the cultivators to the collectors\n of the tenths,—that is, to Apronius,—by allowing him to demand as much as he chose,\n and to carry off as much as he demanded, were you preparing this defence for your\n trial,—that you had promised by edict that you would assign judges in a trial for an\n eightfold penalty? Even if in truth you were to give power to the cultivator, not\n only to challenge his judges, but even to pick them out of the whole body of the\n Syracusan assembly, (a body of most eminent and honourable men,) still no one could\n bear this new sort of injustice,—that, when one has given up the whole of one's\n produce to the farmer, and had one's property taken out of one's hands, then one is\n to endeavour to recover one's property and to seek its restitution by legal\n proceedings. \n ",
                "32":"\n But when what is granted by the edict is, in name indeed, a trial, but in reality\n a collusion of your attendants, most worthless men, with the collectors, who are\n your partners, and besides that, with the judges, do you still dare to mention that\n trial, especially when what you say is refuted, not merely by my speech, but by the\n facts themselves? when in all the distresses of the cultivators of the soil, and all\n the injustice of the collectors, not only has no trial ever taken place according to\n that splendid edict, but none has ever been so much as demanded? \n ",
                "33":"\n However, he will be more favourable to the cultivators than he appears; for the\n same man who has announced in his edict that he will allow a trial against the\n collectors, in which they shall be liable to an eightfold penalty, had it also set\n down in his edict, that he would grant a similar trial against the cultivators, in\n which they should be liable to a fourfold penalty. Who now dares to say that this\n man was unfavourably disposed or hostile to the cultivators? How much more lenient\n is he to them than to the collectors? He has ordered in his edict that the Sicilian\n magistrate should exact from the cultivator whatever the collector declared ought to\n be paid to him. What sentence has he left behind, which can be pronounced against a\n cultivator of the soil It is not a bad thing, says he, for that fear to exist; so\n that, when the money has been exacted from the cultivator, still there will be\n behind a fear of the court of justice, to prevent him from stirring himself. If you\n wish to exact money from me by process of law, remove the Sicilian magistrate. If\n you employ this violence, what need is there of a process of law? Moreover, who will\n there be who would not prefer paying to your collectors what they demand, to being\n condemned in four times the amount by your attendants. \n ",
                "34":"\n But that is a splendid clause in the edict, that gives notice that in all disputes\n which arise between the cultivator and the collector, he will assign judges, if\n either party wishes it. In the first place, what dispute can there be when he who\n ought to make a claim, makes a seizure instead? and when he seizes, not as much as\n is due, but as much as he chooses? and when he, whose property is seized, cannot\n possibly recover his own by a suit at law? In the second place, this dirty fellow\n wants even in this to seem cunning and wily; for he frames his edict in these\n words—“If either wishes it, I will assign judges.” How neatly does he think he is\n robbing him! He gives each party the power of choice; but it makes no difference\n whether he wrote—“If either wishes it,\" or \"If the collector wishes it.” For the\n cultivator will never wish for those judges of yours. \n ",
                "35":"\n What next? What sort of edicts are those which he issued to meet particular\n occasions, at the suggestion of Apronius? When Quintus Septitius, a most honourable\n man, and a Roman knight, resisted Apronius, and declared that he would not pay more\n than a tenth, a sudden special edict makes its appearance, that no one is to remove\n his corn from the threshing-floor before he has settled the demands of the\n collector. Septitius put up with this injustice also, and allowed his corn to be\n damaged by the rain, while remaining on the threshing-floor, when on a sudden that\n most fruitful and profitable edict comes out, that every one was to have his tenths\n delivered at the water-side before the first of August. \n ",
                "36":"\n By this edict, it was not the Sicilians, (for he had already sufficiently crushed\n and ruined them by his previous edicts,) but all those Roman knights who had fancied\n that they could preserve their rights against Apronius, excellent men, and highly\n esteemed by other praetors, who were delivered bound hand and foot into the power of\n Apronius. For just listen and see what sort of edicts these are. “A man,” says he,\n “is not to remove his corn from the threshing-floor, unless he has settled all\n demands.” This is a sufficiently strong inducement to making unfair demands; for I\n had rather give too much, than not remove my corn from the threshing-floor at the\n proper time. But that violence does not affect Septitius, and some others like\n Septitius, who say, “I will rather not remove my corn, than submit to an\n extortionate demand.” To these then the second edict is opposed. “You must have\n delivered it by the first of August.” I will deliver it then.—“Unless you have\n settled the demands, you shall not remove it.” So the fixing of the day for\n delivering it at the waterside, compelled the man to remove his corn from the\n threshing floor. And the prohibition to remove, unless the demand were settled, made\n the settlement compulsory and not voluntary. \n ",
                "37":"\n But what follows is not only contrary to the law of Hiero, not only contrary to\n the customs of all former praetors, but even contrary to all the rights of the\n Sicilians, which they have as granted them by the senate and people of Rome ,—that they shall not be forced to give\n security to appear in any courts of justice but their own. Verres made a regulation\n that the cultivator should appear to an action brought by a collector in any court\n which the collector might choose. So that in this way also gain might accrue to\n Apronius, when he dragged a defendant all the way from Leontini to Lilybaeum to appear before the court there, by\n making false accusations against the wretched cultivators. Although that device for\n false accusation was also contrived with singular cunning, when he ordered that the\n cultivators should make a return of their acres, as to what they were sown with. And\n this had not only great power in causing most iniquitous claims to be submitted to,\n as we shall show hereafter, and that too without any advantage to the republic, but\n at the same time it gave a great handle to false accusations, which all men were\n liable to if Apronius chose. \n ",
                "38":"\n For, as any one said anything contrary to his inclination, immediately he was\n summoned before the court on some charge relative to the returns made of his lands.\n Through fear of which action a great quantity of corn was extorted from many, and\n vast sums were collected; not that it was really difficult to male a correct return\n of a man's acres, or even to make an extravagantly liberal one, (for what danger\n could there be in doing that?) but still it opened a pretext for demanding a trial\n because the cultivator had not made his return in the terms of the edict. And you\n must feel sure what sort of trial that would be while that man was praetor, if you\n recollect what sort of a train and retinue he had about him. What is it, then, which\n I wish you to understand, O judges, from the iniquity of these new edicts? That any\n injury has been done to our allies? That you see. That the authority of his\n predecessors has been overruled by him? He will not dare to deny it. \n ",
                "39":"\n That Apronius had such great influence while he was praetor? That he must\n unavoidably confess. But perhaps you will inquire in this place, as the law reminds\n you to do, whether he himself has made any money by this conduct. I will show you\n that he has made vast sums, and I will prove that he established all those\n iniquitous rules which I have mentioned before, with no object but his own profit,\n when I have first removed out of his line of defence that rampart which he thinks he\n shall be able to employ against all my attacks. I sold, says\n he, the tenths at a high price. What are you saying? Did you, O most audacious and\n senseless of men, sell the tenths? Did you sell those portions which the senate and\n people of Rome allowed you to sell, or the\n whole produce; and in that the whole property and fortunes of the cultivators? If\n the crier had openly given notice by your order, that there was being sold, not a\n tenth, but half the corn, and if purchasers had come with the idea of buying half\n the corn—if then you had sold the half for more than the other praetors had sold the\n tenth part of it, would that seem strange to any one? But what shall we say if the\n crier gave notice of a sale of the tenths, but if, in fact, by your regulation,—by\n your edict,—by the terms of the sale which you offered, more than a half portion Was\n sold? Will you still think that creditable to yourself, to have sold what you had no\n right to sell for more than others sold what they fairly could? \n ",
                "40":"\n Oh, you sold the tenths for more than others had sold them. By what means did you\n manage that? by innocent means? Look at the temple of Castor, and then, if you dare,\n talk of your innocent means. By your diligence? Look at the erasures in your\n registers at the name of Sthenius of Thermae, and then have the face to call\n yourself diligent. By your ability? You who refused at the former pleadings to put\n questions to the witnesses, and preferred presenting yourself dumb before them, pray\n call yourself and your advocates able men as much as you please. By what means,\n then, did you manage what you say you did? For it is a great credit to you if you\n have surpassed your predecessors in ability, and left to your successors your\n example and your authority. Perhaps you had no one before you fit to imitate.

                "41":"\n What cultivator of the soil, when you were praetor, paid a tenth? Who paid\n two-tenths only? Who was there who did not think himself treated with the greatest\n lenity if he paid three tenths instead of one, except a few men, who, on account of\n a partnership with you in your robberies, paid nothing at all? See how great a\n difference there is between your harshness and the kindness of the senate. The\n senate, when owing to any necessity of the republic it is compelled to decree that a\n second tenth shall be exacted, decrees that for that second tenth money be paid to\n the cultivators, so that the quantity which is taken beyond what is strictly due may\n be considered to be purchased, not to be taken away. You, when you were exacting and\n seizing so many tenths, not by a decree of the senate, but by your own edicts and\n nefarious regulations, shall you think that you have done a great deed if you sell\n them for more than Lucius Hortensius, the father of this Quintus Hortensius,\n did,—than Cnaeus Pompeius or Caius Marcellus sold them for; men who did not violate\n justice, or law, or established rules? \n ",

What have you\n brought about? What have you gained? In order that, while you were praetor, some\n addition might be made to the revenue derived from the tenths, you have caused the\n allotments of land to be deserted and abandoned. Lucius Metellus succeeded you. Were\n you more innocent than Metellus? Were you more desirous of credit and honour? For\n you were seeking the consulship, but Metellus neglected the renown which he had\n inherited from his father and his grandfather. He sold the tenths for much less, not\n only than you had done, but even than those had who had sold them before you.\n I ask, if he himself\n could not contrive any means for selling them at the best possible price, could he\n not follow in the fresh steps of you the very last praetor, so as to use your\n admirable edicts and regulations, invented and devised by you their author? \n ",
                "43":"\n But he thought that he should not at all be a Metellus if he imitated you in\n anything; he who when he thought that he was to go to that province sent letters to\n the cities of Sicily from Rome , a thing which no one in the memory of man\n ever did before, in which he exhorts and entreats the Sicilians to plough and sow\n their land for the service of the Roman people. He begs this some time before his\n arrival, and at the same time declares that he will sell the tenths according to the\n law of Hiero; that is to say, that in the whole business of the tenths he will do\n nothing like that man. And he writes this, not from being impelled by any\n covetousness to send letters into the province before his time, but out of prudence,\n lest, if the seed-time passed, we should have not a single grain of corn in the\n province of Sicily . See Metellus's letters.\n \n ",
                "44":"\n Read the letter of Lucius Metellus. [The letters of Lucius Metellus are read.]\n It is these letters, O\n judges, of Lucius Metellus, which you have heard, that have raised all the corn that\n there in this year in Sicily . No one would\n have broken one clod of earth in all the land of Sicily subject to the payment of tenths, if Metellus had not sent\n this letter. What? Did this idea occur to Metellus by inspiration, or had he his\n information from the Sicilians who had come to Rome in great numbers, and from the traders of Sicily ? And who is ignorant what great crowds of\n them assembled at the door of the Marcelli, the most ancient patrons of Sicily ? what crowds of them thronged to Cnaeus\n Pompeius, the consul elect, and to the rest of the men connected with the province?\n And such a thing never yet took place in the instance of any one, as for a man to be\n openly accused by those people over whose property and families he had supreme\n dominion and power. So great was the effect of his injuries, that men preferred to\n suffer anything, rather than not to bewail themselves and complain of his wickedness\n and injuries. \n ",
                "45":"\n And when Metellus had sent these letters couched in almost a supplicating tone to\n all the cities, still he was far from prevailing with them to sow the land as they\n formerly had. For many had fled, as I shall presently show, and had left not only\n their allotments of land, but even their paternal homes, being driven away by the\n injuries of that man. I will not indeed, O judges, say\n anything for the sake of unduly exaggerating my charges. But the sentiments which I\n have imbibed through my eyes and in my mind, those I will state to you truly, and,\n as far as I can, plainly. \n ",
                "46":"\n For when four years afterwards I came into Sicily , it appeared to me in such a condition as those countries are\n apt to be in, in which a bitter and long war has been carried on. Those plains and\n fields which I had formerly seen beautiful and verdant, I now saw so laid waste and\n desolate that the very land itself seemed to feel the want of its cultivators, and\n to be mourning for its master. The land of Herbita, of Enna , of Morgantia, of Assoria, of Imachara, and of Agyrium , was so deserted as to its principal part,\n that we had to look not only for the allotments of land, but also for the body of\n owners. But the district of Aetna , which\n used to be most highly cultivated, and that which was the very head of the corn\n country, the district of Leontini, the character of which was formerly such that\n when you had once seen that sown, you did not fear any dearness of provisions, was\n so rough and unsightly, that in the most fruitful part of Sicily we were asking where Sicily could be gone? The previous year had, indeed,\n greatly shaken the cultivators, but the last one had utterly ruined them. \n ",
                "47":"\n Will you dare also to make mention to me of the tenths? Do you, after such\n wickedness, after such cruelty, after such numerous and serious injuries done to\n people, when the whole province of Sicily \n entirely depends on its arable land, and on its rights connected with that land;\n after the cultivators have been entirely ruined, the fields deserted—after you have\n left no one in so wealthy and populous a province—not only no property, but no hope\n even remaining; do you, I say, think that you can acquire any popularity by saying\n that you have sold the tenths at a better price than the other praetors? As if the\n Roman people had formed this wish, or the senate had given you this commission, by\n seizing all the fortunes of the cultivators under the name of tenths, to deprive the\n Roman people for all future time of that revenue, and of their supply of corn; and,\n as if after that, by adding some part of your own plunder to the total amount got\n from the tenths, you could appear to have deserved well of the Roman people.\n And I say this, as if his injustice was to be reproved in\n this particular, that, out of a desire for credit to be got by surpassing others in\n the sum derived from tenths, he had put forth a law rather too severe, and edicts\n rather too stringent, and rejected the examples of all his predecessors. \n ",
                "48":"\n You sold the tenths at a high price. What will be said, if I prove that you\n appropriated and took to your own house no less a sum than you had sent to\n Rome under the name of tenths? What is\n there to obtain popularity for you in that plan of yours, when you took for yourself\n from a province of the Roman people a share equal to that which you sent to the\n Roman people? What will be said if I prove that you took twice as much corn yourself\n as you sent to the Roman people? Shall we still expect to see your advocate toss his\n head at this accusation, and throw himself on the people, and on the assembly here\n present? These things you have heard before, O judges; but perhaps you have heard it\n on no other authority than report, and the common conversation of men. Know now that\n an enormous sum was taken by him on pretences connected with corn; and consider at\n the same time the profligacy of that saying of his, when he said that by the profit\n made on the tenths alone, he could buy himself off from all his dangers. \n ",
                "49":"\n We have heard this for a long time, O judges. I say that there is not one of you\n who has not often heard that the collectors of the tenths were that mans partners. I\n do not think that anything else has been said against him falsely by those who think\n ill of him but this. For they are to be considered partners of a man, with whom the\n gains of a business are shared. But I say that the whole of these gains, and the\n whole of the fortunes of the cultivators, went to Verres alone. I say that Apronius,\n and those slaves of Venus, who were quite a new class of farmers first heard of in\n his praetorship! and the other collectors, were only agents of that one man's gains,\n and ministers of his plunder. How do you prove that? \n ",
                "50":"\n How did I prove that he had committed robbery in the contract for those pillars?\n Chiefly, I think, by this fact, that he had put forth an unjust and unprecedented\n law. For who ever attempted to change all the rights of people, and the customs of\n all men, getting great blame for so doing, except for some gain? I will proceed and\n carry this matter further. You sold the tenths according to an unjust law, in order\n to sell them for more money. Why, when the tenths were now knocked down and\n sold,—when nothing could now be added to their sum total, but much might be to your\n own gains,—why did new edicts appear, made on a sudden and to meet an emergency? For\n I say, that in your third year you issued edicts, that a collector might summon a\n man before the court anywhere he liked; that the cultivator might not remove his\n corn from the threshing-floor, before he had settled the claims of the collector;\n that they should have the tenths delivered at the water-side before the first of\n August. All these edicts, I say, you issued after the tenths had been sold. But if\n you had issued them for the sake of the republic, notice would have been given of\n them at the time of selling; because you were acting with a view to your own\n interest, you, being prompted by your love of gain and by the emergency, repaired\n the omission which had unintentionally occurred. \n ",
                "51":"\n But who can be induced to believe this—that you, without any profit, or even\n without the greatest profit to yourself, disregarded the great disgrace, the great\n danger to your position as a free man, and to your fortunes, which you were\n incurring, so far as, though you were daily hearing the groans and complaints of all\n Sicily ,—though, as you yourself have\n said, you expected to be brought to trial for this,—though the hazard of this\n present trial is not at all inconsistent with the opinion you yourself had\n formed,—still to allow the cultivators of the soil to be harassed and plundered with\n circumstances of the most scandalous injustice? In truth, though you are a man of\n singular cruelty and audacity, still you would be unwilling for a whole province to\n be alienated from you,—for so many most honourable men to be made your greatest\n enemies, if your desire for money and present booty had not overcome all reason and\n all consideration of safety. \n ",
                "52":"\n But, O judges, since it is not possible for me to detail to you the sum total and\n the whole number of his acts of injustice,—since it would be an endless task to\n speak separately of the injuries done to each individual,—I beg you, listen to the\n different kinds of injustice. There is a man of Centuripa, named Nympho, a clever and industrious\n man, a most experienced and diligent cultivator. He, though he rented very large\n allotments, (as other rich men like him have been in the habit of doing in\n Sicily ,) and though he cultivated them at\n great expense, keeping a great deal of stock, was treated by that man with such\n excessive injustice, that he not only abandoned his allotments, but even fled from\n Sicily , and came to Rome with many others who had been driven away by\n that man. He then contrived that the collector should assert that Nympho had not\n made a proper return of his number of acres, according to that notable edict, which\n had no other object except making profit of this sort. \n ",
                "53":"\n As Nympho wished to defend himself in a regular action, he appoints some excellent\n judges, that same physician Cornelius, (his real name is Artemidorus, a citizen of\n Perga, under which name he had formerly in his own country acted as guide to Verres,\n and as prompter in his exploit of plundering the temple of Diana,) and Volusius the\n soothsayer, and Valerius the crier. Nympho was condemned before he had fairly got\n into court. In what penalty? perhaps you will ask, for there was no fixed sum\n mentioned in the edict In the penalty of all the corn which was on his\n threshing-floors. So Apronius the collector takes, by a penalty for violating an\n edict, and not by any rights connected with his farming the revenue—not the tenth\n that was due, not corn that had been removed and concealed, but seven thousand\n medimni of wheat—from the allotments of Nympho.\n \n ",
                "54":"\n A farm belonging to the wife of Xeno \n Menenius, a most noble man, had been let to a settler. The settler, because he could\n not bear the oppressive conduct of the collectors, had fled from his land. Verres\n gave his favourite sentence of condemnation against\n Xeno for not having made a return of his\n acres. Xeno said that it was no business of\n his; that the farm was let. Verres ordered a trial to take place according to this\n formula,—“If it should appear” that there were more acres in the farm than the\n settler had returned, then Xeno was to be\n condemned. He said not only that he had not been the cultivator of the land, which\n was quite sufficient, but also that he was neither the owner of that farm, nor the\n lessor of it; that it belonged to his wife; that she herself transacted her own\n affairs; that she had let the land. A man of the very highest reputation, and of the\n greatest authority, defended Xeno , Marcus\n Cossetius. Nevertheless Verres ordered a trial, in which the penalty was fixed at\n eighty thousand sesterces .\n Xeno , although he saw that judges were\n provided for him out of that band of robbers, still said that he would stand the\n trial. Then that fellow, with a loud voice, so that Xeno might hear it, orders his\n slaves of Venus to take care the man does not escape while the trial is proceeding,\n and as soon as it is over to bring him before him. And at the same time he said\n also, that he did not think that, if from his riches he disregarded the penalty of a\n conviction, he would also disregard the scourge. He, under the compulsion of this\n violence and this fear, paid the collectors all that Verres commanded. \n ",
                "55":"\n There is a citizen of Morgentia, named Polemarchus, a virtuous and honourable man.\n He, when seven hundred medimni were demanded as the\n tenths due on fifty acres, because he refused to pay them, was summoned before the\n praetor at his own house; and, as he was still in bed, he was introduced into his\n bed-chamber, into which no one else was admitted, except his woman and the\n collector. There he was beaten and kicked about till, though he had refused before\n to pay seven hundred medimni , he now promised a\n thousand. Eubulides Grosphus is a man of Centuripa, a man above all others of his\n city, both for virtue and high birth, and also for wealth. They left this man, O\n judges, the most honourable man of a most honourable city, not merely only so much\n corn, but only so much life as pleased Apronius. For by force, by violence, and by\n blows, he was induced to give corn, not as much as he had, but as much as was\n demanded of him, which was even more. \n ",
                "56":"\n Sostratus, and Numenius, and Nymphodorus, of the same city, three brothers of\n kindred sentiments, when they had fled from their lands because more corn was\n demanded of them than their lands had produced, were treated thus,—Apronius\n collected a band of men, came into their allotments, took away all their tools,\n carried off their slaves, and drove off their live stock. Afterwards, when\n Nymphodorus came to Aetna to him, and\n begged to have his property restored to him, he ordered the man to be seized and\n hung up on a wild olive, a tree which is the forum there; and an ally and friend of\n the Roman people, a settler and cultivator of your domain, hung suspended from a\n tree in a city of our allies, and in the very forum, for as long a period as\n Apronius chose. \n ",
                "57":"\n I have now been recounting to you, O judges, the species of\n countless injuries which he has wrought,—one of each sort. An infinite host of evil\n actions I pass over. Place before your own eyes, keep in your minds, these invasions\n by collectors of the whole of Sicily , their\n plunderings of the cultivators of the soil, the harshness of this man, the absolute\n reign of Apronius. He despised the Sicilians; he did not consider them as men, he\n thought that they would not be vigorous in avenging themselves, and that you would\n treat their oppression lightly. \n ",
                "58":"\n Be it so. He adopted a false opinion about them, and a very injurious one about\n you. But while he deserved so ill of the Sicilians, at least, I suppose, he was\n attentive to the Roman citizens; he favoured them; he was wholly devoted to securing\n their good-will and favour? He attentive to the Roman citizens? There were no men to\n whom he was more severe or more hostile. I say nothing of chains, of imprisonment,\n of scourgings, of executions. I say nothing even of that cross which he wished to be\n a witness to the Roman citizens of his humanity and benevolence to them. I say\n nothing, I say, of all this, and I put all this off to another opportunity. I am\n speaking about the tenths,—about the condition of the Roman citizens in their\n allotments; and how they were treated you heard from themselves. They have told you\n that their property was taken from them. \n ",
                "59":"\n But since there was such a cause for it as there was, these things are to he\n endured,—I mean, the absence of all influence in justice, of all influence in\n established customs. There are, in short, no evils, O judges, of such magnitude that\n bravo men, of great and free spirit, think them intolerable. What shall we say if,\n while that man was praetor, violent hands were, without any hesitation, laid by\n Apronius on Roman knights, who were not obscure, nor unknown, but honourable, and\n even illustrious? What more do you expect? What more do you think I can say? Must I\n pass as quickly as possible from that man and from his actions, in order to come to\n Apronius, as, when I was in Sicily , I\n promised him that I would do?—who detained for two days in the public place at\n Leontini, Caius Matrinius, a man, O judges, of the greatest virtue, the greatest\n industry, the highest popularity. Know, O judges, that a Roman knight was kept two\n days without food, without a roof over his head, by a man born in disgrace, trained\n in infamy, practiced in accommodating himself to all Verres's vices and lusts; that\n he was kept and detained by the guards of Apronius two days in the forum at\n Leontini, and not released till he had agreed to submit to his terms. \n ",
                "60":"\n For why, O judges, should I speak of Quintus Lollius, a Roman knight of tried\n probity and honour? (the matter which I am going to mention is clear, notorious, and\n undoubted throughout all Sicily ;)—who, as\n he was a cultivator of the domain in the district of Aetna , and as his farm belonged to Apronius's district as well as the\n rest, relying on the ancient authority and influence of the equestrian order,\n declared that he would not pay the collectors more than was due from him to them.\n His words are reported to Apronius. He laughed, and marveled that Lollius had heard\n nothing of Matrinius or of his other actions. He sends his slaves of Venus to the\n man. Remark this also, that a collector had officers appointed to attend him by the\n praetor; and see if this is a slight argument that he abused the name of the\n collectors to purposes of his own gain. Lollius is brought before Apronius by the\n slaves of Venus, and dragged along, at a convenient moment, when Apronius had just\n returned from the palaestra, and was lying on a couch which he had spread in the\n forum of Aetna Lollius is placed in the middle of that seemly banquet of gladiators.\n \n ",
                "61":"\n I would not, in truth, O judges, believe the things which I am now saying although\n I heard them commonly talked about, if the old man had not himself told them to me\n in the most solemn manner, when he was with tears expressing his thanks to me and to\n the willingness with which I had undertaken this accusation. A Roman knight, I say,\n nearly ninety years old, is placed in the middle of Apronius's banquet, while\n Apronius in the meantime was rubbing his head and face with ointment. “What is this,\n Lollius,” says he; “cannot you behave properly, unless you are compelled by severe\n measures?” What was the man to do? should he hold his tongue, or answer him? In\n truth he, a man of that bright character, and that age, did not know what to do.\n Meantime Apronius called for supper and wine; and his slaves, who were of no better\n manners than their master, and were born of the same class and in the same rank of\n life, brought these things before the eyes of Lollius. The guests began to laugh,\n Apronius himself roared; unless, perchance, you suppose that he did not laugh in the\n midst of wine and feasting, who even now at the time of his danger and ruin cannot\n suppress his laughter. Not to detain you too long; know, O judges, that Quintus\n Lollius, under the compulsion of these insults, came into the terms and conditions\n of Apronius. \n ",
                "62":"\n Lollius, enfeebled by old age and disease, could not come to give his evidence.\n What need have we of Lollius? There is no one who is ignorant of this, no one of\n your own friends, no one who is brought forward by you, no one at all who, if he is\n asked, will say that he now hears this for the first time. Marcus Lollius, his son,\n a most excellent young man, is present; you shall hear what he says—For Quintus\n Lollius, his son, who was the accuser of Calidius, a young man both virtuous and\n bold, and of the highest reputation for eloquence, when being excited by these\n injuries and insults he had set out for Sicily , was murdered on the way; and the crime of his death is\n imputed indeed to fugitive slaves; but, in reality, no one in Sicily doubts that he must be murdered because he\n could not keep to himself his intentions respecting Verres. He, in truth, had no\n doubt that the man who, under the prompting of a mere love of justice, had already\n accused another, would be ready as an accuser for him on his arrival, when he was\n stimulated by the injuries of his father, and indignation at the treatment received\n by his family. \n ",
                "63":"\n Do you now thoroughly understand, O judges, what a pest, what a barbarian has been\n let loose in your most ancient, most loyal, and nearest province? Do you see now on\n what account Sicily , which has before this\n endured the thefts, and rapine, and iniquities, and insults of so many men, has not\n been able to submit to this unprecedented, and extraordinary, and incredible series\n of injuries and insults? All men are now aware why the whole province sought out\n that man as a defender of its safety, from the effects of whose good faith, and\n diligence, and perseverance Verres could not possibly be saved. You have been\n present at many trials, you know that many guilty and wicked men have been impeached\n within your own recollection, and that of your ancestors.

Thither he ordered\n most honourable men to be summoned, not only Sicilians, but even Roman knights, so\n that men of the most thoroughly proved honour were detained at his banquet, when\n none but the most impure and profligate men would join him in a banquet. Would you,\n O most profligate and abandoned of all mortals, when you knew these things, when you\n were hearing of them every day, when you were seeing them, would you ever have\n allowed or endured that such things should have taken place, to your own great\n danger, if they had taken place without enormous profit to yourself? Was it the\n profit made by Apronius, and his most beastly conversation, and his flagitious\n caresses, that had such influence with you, that no care for or thought of your own\n fortunes ever touched your mind? \n ",

You see some men suspended from trees; others\n beaten and scourged; others kept as prisoners in the public place; others left\n standing alone at a feast; others condemned by the physician and crier of the\n praetor; and nevertheless the property of all of them is carried off from the fields\n and plundered at the same time. What is all this? Is this the rule of the Roman\n people? Are these the laws of the Roman people? are these their tribunals? are these\n their faithful allies? is this their suburban province? Are not rather all these\n things such that even Athenio would not have done them if he had been victorious in\n Sicily ? I say, O judges, that the\n evidence of fugitive slaves would not have equalled one quarter of the wickedness of\n that man. In this manner\n did he behave to individuals. What more shall I say?

                "66":"\n And first of all, listen to a brief tale concerning the people of Agyrium , a loyal and illustrious people. The state\n of Agyrium is among the first in all\n Sicily for honour;—a state of men wealthy\n before this man came as praetor, and of excellent cultivators of the soil. When this\n same Apronius had purchased the tenths of that district, he came to Agyrium ; and when he had come thither with his\n regular attendants—that is to say, with threats and violence,—he began to ask an\n immense sum, so that when he had got his profit, he might depart. He said that he\n did not wish to have any trouble, nut that, when he had got his money, he would\n depart as soon as possible to some other city. All the Sicilians are not\n contemptible men, if only our magistrates leave them alone; but they are many, of\n sufficient courage, and very economical and temperate, and among the very first is\n this city of which I am now speaking, O judges. \n ",

Apronius informs Verres, whose business it ready\n was, what was going on. \n Immediately, as if there had been some conspiracy at Agyrium formed against the republic, or as if the lieutenant of the\n praetor had been assaulted, the magistrates and five principal citizens are summoned\n from Agyrium at his command. They went to\n Syracuse . Apronius is there. He says\n that those very men who had come had acted contrary to the praetor's edict. They\n asked, in what? He answered, that he would say in what before the judges. He, that\n most just man, tried to strike his old terror into the wretched Agyrians; he\n threatened that he would appoint their judges out of his own retinue. The Agyrians,\n being very intrepid men, said that they would stand the trial. \n ",
                "68":"\n That fellow put on the tribunal Artemidorus Cornelius, the physician, Valerius,\n the crier, Tlepolemus, the painter, and judges of that sort; not one of whom was a\n Roman citizen, but Greek robbers of temples, long since infamous, and now all\n Corneliuses. The Agyrians saw that whatever charge Apronius brought before whose\n judges, he would very easily prove; but they preferred to be convicted, and so add\n to his unpopularity and infamy, rather than accede to his conditions and terms. They\n asked what formula would be given to the judges on which to try them? He answered,\n “If it appeared that they had acted contrary to the edict,” on which formula he said\n that he should pronounce judgment. They preferred trying the question according to a\n most unjust formula, and with most profligate judges, rather than come to any\n settlement with him of their own accord. He sent Timarchides privately to them, to\n warn them, if they were wise, to settle the matter. They refused. “What, then, will\n you do? Do you prefer to be convicted each of you in a penalty of fifty thousand\n sesterces ?” They said they did. Then he said out\n loud, in the hearing of every one, “Whoever is condemned, shall be beaten to death\n with rods.” On this they began with tears to beg and entreat him to be allowed to\n give up their cornfields, and all their produce, and their allotments, when stripped\n of everything, to Apronius, and to depart themselves without insult and annoyance.\n \n ",
                "69":"\n These were the terms, O judges, on which Verres sold the tenths. Hortensius may\n say, if he pleases, that Verres sold them at a high price. This was the condition of the cultivators\n of the soil while that man was praetor; that they thought themselves exceedingly\n well off, if they might give up their fields when stripped of everything to\n Apronius, for they wished to escaped the many crosses which were set before their\n eyes. Whatever Apronius had declared to be due, that they were forced to give,\n according to the edict. Suppose he declared more was due than the land produced?\n Just so. How could that be? The magistrates were bound, according to his own edict,\n to compel the payment. Well, but the cultivators could recover. Yes, but Artemidorus\n was the judge. What next? What happened if the cultivator had given less than\n Apronius had demanded? A prosecution of the cultivator to recover a fourfold\n penalty. Before judges taken from what body? From that admirable retinue of most\n honourable men in attendance on the praetor. What more? I say that you returned less\n than the proper number of acres: select judges for the matter which is to be tried,\n namely, your violation of the edict. Out of what class? Out of the same retinue.\n What will be the end of it? If you are convicted, (and what doubt can there be about\n a conviction with those judges?) you must be beaten to death with rods. When these\n are the rules, these the conditions, will there be any one so foolish as to think\n that what was sold were the tenths? Who believes that nine parts were left to the\n cultivator? Who does not perceive that that fellow considered as his own gain and\n plunder the property and possessions and fortunes of the cultivators? From fear of\n the gods the Agyrians said that they would do what they were commanded to. \n ",
                "70":"\n Listen now to what his orders were; and conceal, if you can, that you are aware of\n what all Sicily well knew, that the praetor\n himself was the farmer of the tenths, or rather the lord and sovereign of all the\n allotments in the province. He orders the Agyrians to take the tenths themselves in\n the name of their city, and to give a compliment to Apronius. If he had bought them\n at a high price, since you are a man who inquired into the proper price with great\n diligence, who, as you say, sold them at a high price, why do you think that a\n compliment ought to be added as a present to the purchaser? Be it so; you did think\n so. Why did you order them to add it? What is the meaning; of taking and\n appropriating money, for which the law has a hold on you, if this is not it,—I mean\n the compelling men by force and despotic power against their will to give a\n compliment to another, that is to say, to give him money? \n ",
                "71":"\n Well, what comes next? If they were ordered to give some small compliment to\n Apronius, the delight of the praetor's life, suppose that it was given to Apronius,\n if it seems to you the compliment to Apronius, and not the plunder of the praetor.\n You order them to take the tenths; to give Apronius a compliment,—thirty-three\n thousand medimni of wheat. What is this? One city\n is compelled by the command of the praetor to give to the Roman people out of one\n district almost food enough to support it for a month. Did you sell the tenths at a\n high price, when such a compliment was given to the collector? In truth, if you had\n inquired carefully into the proper price, then when you were selling them, they\n would rather have given ten thousand medimni more\n then, than six hundred thousand sesterces \n afterwards. It seems a great booty. Listen to what follows, and remark it carefully,\n so as to be the less surprised that the Sicilians, being compelled by their\n necessity, entreated aid from their patrons, from the consuls, from the senate, from\n the laws, from the tribunals. \n ",
                "72":"\n To pay Apronius for testing the wheat which was given to him, Verres orders the\n Agyrians to pay Apronius three sesterces for every\n medimnus . What is this? When such a quantity of corn has been\n extorted and exacted under the name of a compliment, is money to be exacted besides\n for testing the corn? Or could, not only Apronius, but any one, if corn was to be\n served out to the army, disapprove of the Sicilian corn, which Verres might have\n measured on the threshing-floor, if he had liked? That vast quantity of corn is\n given and extorted at your command. That is not enough. Money is demanded besides.\n It is paid. That is too little. For the tenths of barley more money is extorted. You\n order thirty thousand sesterces to be paid. And so\n from one city there are extorted by force, by threats, by the despotic power and\n injustice of the praetor thirty-three thousand medimni of wheat, and besides that, sixty thousand sesterces ! Are these things obscure? Or, even if all the\n world wished it, can those things be obscure which you did openly, which you ordered\n in open court, which you extorted when every one was looking on? concerning which\n matters the magistrates and five chief men of Agyrium, whom you summoned from their\n homes for the sake of your own gain, reported your acts and commands to their own\n senate at home; and that report, according to their laws, was recorded in the public\n registers, and the ambassadors of the Agyrians, most noble men, are at Rome , and have deposed to these facts in evidence.\n \n ",
                "73":"\n Examine the public letters of the Agyrians; after that the public testimony of the\n city. Read the public letters. [The public letters are read.] Read the public\n evidence. [The public evidence is read.] You have remarked\n in this evidence, O judges, that Apollodorus, whose surname is Pyragrus, the chief\n man of his city, have his evidence with tears, and said that since the name of the\n Roman people had been heard by and known to the Sicilians, the Agyrians had never\n either said or done anything contrary to the interests of even the meanest of the\n Roman citizens; but that now they are compelled by great injuries, and great\n suffering to give evidence in a public manner against a praetor of the Roman people.\n You cannot, in truth. O Verres, invalidate the evidence of this one city by your\n defence; so great a weight is there in the fidelity of these men, such great\n indignation is there at their injuries, such great conscientiousness is there in the\n way in which they gave their evidence. But it is not one city alone, but every city,\n that now being crushed by similar distresses pursues you with deputations and public\n evidence. \n ",
                "74":"\n Let us now, in regular order, proceed to see in what way the city of Herbita, an\n honourable and formerly a wealthy city, was harassed and plundered by him. A city of\n what sort of men? Of excellent agriculturists, men most remote from courts of law,\n from tribunals, and from disputes; whom you, O most profligate of men, ought to have\n spared, whose interests you ought to have consulted, the whole race of whom you\n ought most carefully to have preserved. In the first year of your praetorship the\n tenths of that district were sold for eighteen thousand \n medimni of wheat. When Atidius, who was also his\n servant in the matter of tenths, had purchased them, and when he had come to Herbita\n with the title of' prefect, attended by the slaves of Verres, and when a place where\n he might lodge had been assigned him by the public act of the city, the people of\n Herbita are compelled to give him as a profit thirty-seven thousand modii of wheat, when the tenths of the wheat had been sold\n at eighteen thousand. And they are compelled to give this vast quantity of wheat in\n the name of their city, since the private cultivators of the soil had already fled\n from their lands, having been plundered and driven away by the injuries of the\n collectors. \n ",
                "75":"\n In the second year, when Apronius had bought the tenths of wheat for twenty-five\n thousand modii , and when he himself had come to\n Herbita with his whole force and his whole band of robbers, the people was compelled\n to give him in the name of the city a present of twenty-six thousand modii of wheat, and a further gift of two thousand\n sesterces . I am not quite sure about this further\n gift, whether it was not given to Apronius himself as wages for his trouble, and a\n reward for his impudence. But concerning such an immense quantity of wheat, who can\n doubt that it came to that robber of corn, Verres, just as the corn of Agyrium did? But in the third year he adopted in\n this district the custom of sovereigns. They say that the barbarian kings of the Persians and Syrians are\n accustomed to have several wives, and to give to these wives cities in this\n fashion:—that this city is to dress the woman's waist, that one to dress her neck,\n that to dress her hair; and so they have whole nations not only privy to their\n lusts, but also assistants in it. \n ",
                "76":"\n Learn that the licentiousness and lust of that man who thought himself king of the\n Sicilians, was much the same. The name of the wife of Aeschrio, a Syracusan, is\n Pippa, whose name has been made notorious over all Sicily by that man's profligacy, and many verses were inscribed on\n the praetor's tribunal, and over the praetor's head, about that woman. This\n Aeschrio, the imaginary husband of Pippa, is appointed as a new farmer of the tenths\n of Herbita. When the men of Herbita saw that if the business got into Aeschrio's\n hands they should be plundered at the will of a most dissolute woman, they did\n against him as far as they thought that they could go. Aeschrio bid on, for he was\n not afraid that, while Verres was praetor, the woman, who would be really the\n farmer, would ever be allowed to lose by it. The tenths are knocked down to him at\n thirty-five thousand medimni , nearly half as much\n again as they had fetched the preceding year. The cultivators were utterly\n destroyed, and so much the more because in the preceding year they had been drained\n dry, and almost ruined. He was aware that they had been sold at so high a price,\n that more could not be squeezed out of the people; so he deducts from the sum total\n three thousand six hundred medimni , and enters on\n the registers thirty-one thousand four hundred. \n ",
                "77":"\n Docimus had bought the tenths of barley belonging to the same district. This\n Docimus is the man who had brought to Verres Tertia, the daughter of Isidorus the\n actor, having taken her from a Rhodian flute-player. The influence of this woman\n Tertia was greater with him than that of Pippa, or of all the other women, and I had\n almost said, was as great in his Sicilian praetorship as that of Chelidon had been\n in his city praetorship. There come to Herbita the two rivals of the praetor, not\n likely to be troublesome to him, infamous agents of most abandoned women. They begin\n to demand, to beg, to threaten; but though they wished it, they were not able to\n imitate Apronius. The Sicilians were not so much afraid of Sicilians; still, as they\n put forth false accusations in every possible way, the Herbitenses undertake to\n appear in court at Syracuse . When they\n had arrived there, they are compelled to give to Aeschrio—that is, to Pippa—as much\n as had been deducted from the original purchase-money, three thousand six hundred\n modii of wheat. He was not willing to give to the\n woman who was really the farmer too much profits out of the tenths, lest in that\n case she should transfer her attention from her nocturnal gains to the farming of\n the tributes. \n ",
                "78":"\n The people of Herbita thought the matter was settled, when that man added,—“And\n what are you going to give out of the barley to my little friend Docimus? What are\n your intentions?” He transacted all this business, O judges, in his chamber, and in\n his bed. They said that they had no commission to give anything: “I do not hear you;\n pay him fifteen thousand sesterces .” What were the\n wretched men to do I or how could they refuse? especially when they saw the traces\n of the woman who was the collector fresh in the bed, by which they understood that\n he had been inflamed to persevere in his demand. And so one city of our allies and\n friends was made tributary of two most debauched women while Verres was praetor. And\n I now assert that that quantity of corn and those sums of money were given by the\n people of Herbita to the collectors in the name of the city. And yet by all that\n corn and all that money they could not deliver their fellow citizens from the\n injuries of the collectors. For after the property of the cultivators was destroyed\n and carried off, bribes were still to be given to the collectors to induce them to\n depart at length from their lands and from their cities. \n ",
                "79":"\n And so when Philinus of Herbita, a man eloquent and prudent, and noble in his own\n city, spoke in public of the distress of the cultivators, and of their flight, and\n of the scanty numbers that were left behind, you remarked, O judges, the groans of\n the Roman people, a great crowd of whom has always been present at this cause. And\n concerning the scanty number of the cultivators I will speak at another time.\n But at this moment a\n topic, which I had almost passed over, must not be altogether forgotten. For, in the\n name of the immortal gods! how will you, I will not say tolerate, but how will you\n bear even to hear of the sums which Verres subtracted from the sum total? \n ",
                "80":"\n Up to this time there has been one man only since the first foundation of\n Rome , (and may the immortal gods grant\n that there may never be another,) to whom the republic wholly committed herself,\n being compelled by the necessities of the times and domestic misfortunes. He had\n such power, that without his consent no one could preserve either his property, or\n his liberty, or his life. He had such courage in his audacity, that he was not\n afraid to say in the public assembly, when he was selling the property of Roman\n citizens, that he was selling his own booty. All his actions we not only still\n maintain, but out of fear of greater inconveniences and calamities, we defend them\n by the public authority. One decree alone of his has been remodeled by a resolution\n of the senate, and a decree has been passed, that these men, from the sum total of\n whose debts he had made a deduction, should pay the money into the treasury. The\n senate laid down this principle,—that even he to whom they had entrusted everything\n had not power to diminish the total amount of revenue acquired and procured by the\n valour of the Roman people. \n ",
                "81":"\n The conscript fathers decided that he had no power to remit even to the bravest\n men any portion of their debts to the state. And shall the senators decide that you\n have lawfully remitted any to a most profligate woman? The man, concerning whom the\n Roman people had established a law that his absolute will should be the law to the\n Roman people, still is found fault with in this one particular, out of reverence for\n their ancient laws. Did you, who were liable to almost every law, think that your\n lust and caprice was to be a law to you? He is blamed for remitting a part of that\n money which he himself had acquired. Shall you be pardoned who have remitted part of\n the revenue due to the Roman people? \n ",
                "82":"\n And in this description of boldness he proceeded even much more shamelessly with\n respect to the tenths of the district of Segesta; for when he had knocked them down\n to this same Docimus, for five thousand modii of\n wheat, and had added as an extra present fifteen thousand sesterces , he compelled the people of Segesta to take them of Docimus\n at the same price in the name of their city; and you shall have this proved by the\n public testimony of the Segestans. Read the public testimony [The public testimony\n is read.] You have heard at what price the city took the tenths from Docimus,—at\n five thousand modii of wheat, and an extra gift.\n Learn now at what price he entered them in his accounts as having been sold. [The\n law respecting the sale of tithes, Caius Verres being the praetor, is read.] You see\n that in this item three thousand bushels of wheat are deducted from the sum total,\n and when he had taken all this from the food of the Roman people, from the sinews of\n the revenue, from the blood of the treasury, he gave it to Tertia the actress? Shall\n I call it rather an impudent action, to extort from allies of the state, or an\n infamous one to give it to a prostitute? or a wicked one to take it away from the\n Roman people, or an audacious one to make false entries in the public accounts? Can\n any influence or any bribery deliver you from the severity of these judges? And if\n it should deliver you, do you not still see that the things which I am mentioning\n belong to another count of the prosecution, and to the action for peculation? \n ",
                "83":"\n Therefore I will reserve the whole of that class of offences, and return to the\n charge respecting the corn and the tenths which I had begun to speak of. While this man was laying waste the largest and most fertile\n districts by his own agency, that is to say by Apronius, that second Verres, he had\n others whom he could send, like hounds, among the lesser cities, worthless and\n infamous men, to whom he compelled the citizens to give either corn or money in the\n name of their city. There\n is a man called Aulus Valentius in Sicily ,\n an interpreter, whom Verres used to employ not only as an interpreter of the Greek\n language, but also in his robberies and other crimes. This interpreter, an\n insignificant and needy man, becomes on a sudden a farmer of tenths. He purchases\n the tenths of the territory of Lipara , a\n poor and barren district, for six hundred medimni \n of wheat. The people of Lipara are\n convoked: they are compelled to take the tenths, and to pay Valentius thirty\n thousand sesterces as profit. O ye immortal gods!\n which argument will you take for your defence; that you sold the tenths for so much\n less than you might have done,—that the city immediately, of its own accord, added\n to the six hundred medimni thirty thousand sesterces as a compliment, that is to say, two thousand\n medimni of wheat? or that, after you had sold the\n tenths at a high price, you still extorted this money from the people of Lipara against their will? \n ",
                "84":"\n But why do I ask of you what defence you are going to employ, instead of rather\n asking the city itself what you have done. Read the public testimony of the\n Liparans, and after that read how the money was given to Valentius. [The public\n testimony is read.] [The statement how the money was paid, extracted out of the\n public accounts, is read.] Was even this little state, so far removed out of your\n reach and out of your sight, separated from Sicily , placed on a barren and uncultivated island, turned as a sort\n of crown to all your other iniquities, into a source of plunder and profit to you in\n this matter of corn? You had given the whole island to one of your companions as a\n trifling present, and still were these profits from corn exacted from it as from the\n inland states? And therefore the men who for so many years, before you came as\n praetor, were in the habit of ransoming their lands from the pirates, now had a\n price set on themselves, and were compelled to ransom themselves from you. \n ",
                "85":"\n What more need I say? Was not more extorted, under the name of a compliment, from\n the people of Tissa , a very small and\n poor city, but inhabited by very hard-working agriculturists and most frugal men,\n than the whole crop of corn which they had extracted from their land? Among them you\n sent as farmer Diognotus, a slave of Venus, a new class of collector altogether.\n Why, with such a precedent as this, are not the public slaves at Rome also entrusted with the revenues? In the\n second year of your praetorship the Tissans are compelled against their will to give\n twenty-one thousand sesterces as a compliment. In\n the third year they were compelled to give thirty thousand medimni of wheat to Diognotus, a slave of Venus, as a compliment! This\n Diognotus, who is making such vast profits out of the public revenues, has no\n deputy, no peculium at all. Doubt now, if you can,\n whether this Venereal officer of Verres received such an immense quantity of corn\n for himself, or exacted it for his master. \n ",
                "86":"\n And learn this also from the public testimony of the Tissans. [The public\n testimony of the Tissans is read.] Is it only obscurely, O judges, that the praetor\n himself is the farmer, when his officers exact corn from the cities, levy money on\n them, take something more as a compliment for themselves than they are to pay over\n to the Roman people under the name of tenths? This was your idea of equity in your\n command—this was your idea of the dignity of the praetor, to make the slaves of\n Venus the lords of the Sicilian people. This was the line drawn, these were the\n distinctions of rank, while you were the praetor, that the cultivators of the soil\n were to be considered in the class of slaves, the slaves in the light of farmers of\n the revenue. \n ",
                "87":"\n What more shall I say? Were not the wretched people of Amestratus, after such vast\n tenths had been imposed upon them, that they had nothing left for themselves, still\n compelled to pay money besides? The tenths are knocked down to Marcus Caesius in the\n presence of deputies from Amestratus and Heraclius, one of their deputies, is\n compelled at once to pay twenty-two thousand sesterces . What is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of this\n booty? of this violence? of this plundering of the allies? If Heraclius had been\n commissioned by his senate to purchase the tenths, he would have purchased them; if\n he was not, how could he pay money of his own accord? He reports to his fellow\n citizens that he has paid Caesius this money. Learn his report from his letters.\n \n ",
                "88":"\n Read extracts from the public letters. [The public letters are read.] By what\n decree of the senate was this permission given to the deputy? By none. Why did he do\n so?

[The\n public testimony is read.] By the same evidence you see that there was extorted from\n the same city in the second year a sum of money in a similar manner, and given to\n Sextus Vennonius. But you compel the Amestratines, needy men, after you have sold\n their tenths for eight hundred medimni to\n Banobalis, a slave of Venus, (just notice the names of the farmers,) to add more\n still as a compliment, than they had been sold for, though they had been sold at a\n high price. They gave Banobalis eight hundred medimni of wheat, and fifteen hundred sesterces . Surely that man would never have been so senseless, as to\n allow more corn to be given out of the domain of the Roman people to a slave of\n Venus than to the Roman people itself, unless all that plunder had, under the name\n of the slave, come in reality to himself. \n ",

Did you sell the tenths so carelessly, that, when a medimnus cost fifteen sesterces , and\n when the tenths were sold for three thousand medimni , that is, for forty-five thousand sesterces , still three thousand sesterces could be given to the farmer as a compliment? “Oh, but I sold\n the tenths of that district at a high price” he boasts, forsooth, not that a\n compliment was given to Turpio, but that money was taken from the Petrans. \n ",

Hear the\n letters which he sent to the Segestans.

I will take the third\n year, because it is both the most recent, and because it has been managed by him in\n such a way that, since he knew that he was certainly going to depart, he evidently\n did not care if he left behind him not one cultivator of the soil in all Sicily .

                "105":"\n You heard all these things, O judges, all which I now pass by and leave unnoticed.\n I say nothing of the luxury of Apronius, nothing of his insolence, nothing of his\n unexampled profligacy and wickedness; I will only speak of the gain and profit made\n out of one district in one year, so that you may the more easily be able to form\n your conjectures of the whole three years and of the whole of Sicily ; but I do not mean to say much about the\n people of Aetna , for they have come hither\n themselves, they have brought with them their public documents; they have proved to\n you what gains were made by that honest man, the intimate friend of the praetor,\n Apronius. I pray of you learn this from their own testimony. Read the testimony of\n the people of Aetna . [The testimony of the\n people of Aetna is read.] What are you saying? Speak, speak, I pray\n you, louder, that the Roman people may hear about its revenues, its cultivators of\n the soil, its allies, and its friends. “Three hundred thousand medimni ; and fifty thousand sesterces .” Oh, the immortal gods! Does one district in one year years\n three hundred thousand modii of wheat, and fifty\n thousand sesterces besides, as a compliment to\n Apronius? Did the tenths sell for so much less than they were really worth? or,\n though they had been sold at a sufficiently high price, was such a quantity of corn\n and money nevertheless exacted by main force from the cultivators? For whichever of\n these you say was the truth, blame and criminality will attach to it. \n ",
                "106":"\n For you certainly will not say (what I wish you would say) that this quantity\n never came to Apronius. So I will hold you here, not only by the public covenants\n and letters, but also from the private ones of the cultivators, so as to let you\n understand that you were not mere diligent in executing robberies, than I have been\n in detecting them. Will you be able to bear this? Will any one defend you? Will\n these men be able to endure this, if they are inclined to pronounce a sentence\n favourable to you,—that Quintus Apronius, at one visit, out of one district,\n (besides all the money which was paid him, and which I have mentioned,) should have\n taken three hundred thousand modii of wheat, under\n the name of a compliment? \n ",
                "107":"\n What! are they the men of Aetna alone who\n say this? Yes, the Centuripans also, who are in occupation of far the largest part\n of the Aetnaean district, to whose ambassadors, most noble men, Andron and Artemon,\n their senate gave commissions which had reference to their city in his public\n capacity, concerning those injuries which the citizens of Centuripa sustained not in\n their own territories, but in those of others. The senate and people of Centuripa\n did not choose to send ambassadors; but the Centuripan cultivators of the soil,\n which is the greatest body of such men in Sicily , a body of most honourable and most wealthy men, themselves\n selected three ambassadors, fellow citizens of their own, in order that by their\n evidence you might be made aware of the calamities, not of one district only, but of\n almost all Sicily . For the Centuripans are\n engaged as cultivators of the soil in almost every part of Sicily . And they are the more important and the more\n trustworthy witnesses against you, because, the other cities ore influenced by their\n own distresses alone, the Centuripans as they occupy land in almost every district,\n have felt the injuries and wrongs of the other cities also. \n ",
                "108":"\n But as I have said, the case of the men of Aetna is clear enough, and established both by public and by private\n documents. The task allotted to my diligence is to be required of me rather in the\n district of Leontini, for this reason, because the Leontini themselves have not\n assisted me much by their public authority. Nor, in truth, while that fellow was\n praetor, did these injuries of the farmers very greatly affect them, or rather, I\n might say, they did them good. This may, perhaps, appear a marvellous or even an\n incredible thing to you, that in such general distress of the cultivators of the\n soil, the Leontini, who were the heads of the corn interest, should have been free\n from injury and calamity. This is the reason, O judges, that in the territory of\n Leontini, no one of the Leontini, with the exception of the single family of\n Mnasistratus, occupies any land. And so, O judges, you shall hear the evidence of\n Mnasistratus, a most honest and virtuous man. Do not expect to hear any others of\n the Leontini, whom not only Apronius, but whom even a tempest in their fields could\n not injure. They in truth not only suffered no inconvenience, but even in the rapine\n of Apronius they found gain and advantage. \n ",
                "109":"\n Wherefore, since the city and embassy of the Leontini has failed me on account of\n the cause which I have mentioned, I must devise a plan and contrive a way for myself\n by which I may get at the gain of Apronius, or even at his enormous and wicked\n booty. The tenths of the Leontini territory were sold in the third year of Verres's\n praetorship for thirty-six thousand medimni of\n wheat; that is, for two hundred and twenty-six thousand modii of wheat. A great price, O judges, a great price; and I cannot\n deny it. Therefore it is certain that there must have been a loss, or at all events\n not a great gain to the farmers. For this very often happens to men who have taken a\n contract at a high rate. \n ",
                "110":"\n What will you think if I prove to you that, by this one purchase, there were made\n a hundred thousand modii of profit? what if it was\n two hundred thousand? what if three? what if four hundred thousand was the sum? Will\n you still doubt for whom that immense booty was acquired? Will any one say that I am\n unfair if from the mere magnitude of the gain made I form a conjecture as to the\n direction of the stolen goods and plunder? What if I prove to you, O judges, that\n those men who are making four hundred thousand modii of profit would have suffered a loss if your iniquity, O Verres,\n if judges of your retinue had not stepped in? Can any one doubt, in a case of so\n much gain and so much iniquity, that you made such immense profit by dishonest\n means? that for such immense gains you were willing to be dishonest? \n ",
                "111":"\n How then, O judges, am I to arrive at this knowledge of how much profit was made?\n Not from the accounts of Apronius, for when I sought for them, I could not find\n them, and when I brought him into court, I made him deny that he kept any accounts\n at all. If he was telling lies, why did he remove them out of the way, if they were\n likely to do you no harm? If he really had kept any accounts at all, does not that\n alone prove plainly enough, that it was not his own business that he was conducting?\n For it is a quality of tenths, that they cannot be managed without many papers; for\n it is necessary to keep an account of, and to set down in books the names of all the\n cultivators, and with each name the amount of their tenth. All the cultivators made\n returns of their acres according to your command and regulation; I do not believe\n that any one made a return of a smaller quantity than he had in cultivation, when\n there were so many crosses, so many penalties, so many judges of that retinue before\n his eyes. On an acre of Leontini ground about a medimnus of wheat is usually sown, according to the regular and\n constant allowance of seed. The land returns about eightfold on a fair average, but\n in an extraordinarily favourable season, about tenfold. And whenever that is the\n case, it then happens that the tenth is just the same quantity as was sown; that is\n to say, as many acres as are sown, so many medimni \n are due. \n ",
                "112":"\n As this was the case, I say first of all, that the tenths of the territory of\n Leontini were sold for many more thousand medimni \n than there were thousands of acres sown in the district of Leontini. But if it was\n impossible for them to produce more than ten medimni on an acre, and if it was fair that a medimnus should be paid out of each acre liable to the payment of\n tenths, when the land produced a tenfold crop, which however very seldom happened,\n what was the calculation of the farmer if indeed it was the tenths of the cultivator\n that were being sold, and no his whole property, when he bought the tenths for many\n more medimni than there had been acres sown? In the\n Lecutini district the list and return made of acres is not more than thirty\n thousand. The tenths were\n sold for thirty-six thousand medimni . Did Apronius\n make a blunder, or rather was he mad? Yes, he would indeed have been mad if it had\n been lawful for the cultivators to give only what was due from them, and had not\n rather been compulsory on them to give whatever Apronius commanded. \n ",
                "113":"\n If I prove that no man gave less for his tenths than three medimni to the acre, you will admit, I suppose, that, even supposing\n the produce amounted to a tenfold crop, no one paid less than three tenths. And\n indeed this was begged as a favour from Apronius, that they might be allowed to\n compound at three medimni an acre. For, as four and\n even five were exacted from many people, and as many had not only not a grain of\n corn, but not even a wisp of straw left out of all their crop and after all their\n year's labour; then the cultivators of Centuripa, which are the main body of\n agriculturists in the Leontini district, assembled in one place. They sent as a\n delegate to Apronius, Andron of Centuripa, a man among the first of his state for\n honour and nobility, (the same man whom now the city of Centuripa has sent to this\n trial as a deputy and as a witness,) in order that he might plead with him the cause\n of the cultivators of the soil, and beg of him not to exact of the Centuripan\n cultivators more than three medimni for each acre.\n \n ",
                "114":"\n This request was with difficulty obtained from Apronius, as a most excessive\n kindness to those men who were even then safe. And when this was obtained, this is\n what was obtained, forsooth, that they might be allowed to pay three tenths instead\n of one. But if your own interest had not been at stake in the matter, O Verres, they\n would rather have entreated you not to be made to pay more than one tenth, than have\n begged of a promise not to be made to pay more than three. Now, that at the present\n time I may pass over those rules which Apronius, in a kingly, or rather in a\n tyrannical spirit, made with respect to the cultivators, and that I may not at\n present call those men from whom he took all their corn, and to whom he left nothing\n not only of their corn, but nothing even of their property; just see how much gain\n is made of these three medimni , which he considered\n as a great favour and indulgence. \n ",
                "115":"\n The return of acres in the district of Leontini is thirty thousand. This amounts\n to ninety thousand medimni of wheat that is to say,\n to five hundred and forty thousand modii of wheat.\n Deduct two hundred and sixteen thousand modii of\n wheat, being what the tenths were sold for, and there remain three hundred and\n twenty-four thousand modii of wheat; add to the sum\n total of five hundred and forty thousand modii \n three fiftieths, that is to say, thirty-two thousand four hundred modii of wheat, (for three fiftieths besides were exacted\n from every one;) this now amounts to three hundred and fifty-six thousand four\n hundred modii of wheat. But I said that four\n hundred thousand sesterces of profit had been made.\n For I do not include in this calculation those who were not allowed to compound at\n three medimni an acre. But that by this present\n calculation I may make out the sum which I promised to do, many were compelled\n besides to pay two sesterces , and many even five,\n with each medimnus , and those who had to pay least\n paid a sesterce with every medimnus . To take the\n least of these sums, as we calculated there were ninety thousand medimni , we must add to that, according to this new and\n infamous example here given, ninety thousand sesterces . \n ",
                "116":"\n Will he now dare to tell me, that he sold the tenths at a high price, when he took\n for himself more than twice as much as he sent to the Roman people out of the same\n district? You sold the tenths of the Leontine district for two hundred and sixteen\n thousand modii of wheat? If you did so according to\n law, it was a fine price; if your caprice was the law, it was a low price; if you\n sold them so that those were called tenths which were in reality a half, you sold\n them at a very low price. For the yearly produce of all Sicily might be sold for much more, if that was what the senate or\n people of Rome had desired you to do.\n Indeed, the tenths were often sold for as much, when they were sold according to the\n law of Hiero, as they have been sold for now under the law of Verres. Let me have\n the accounts of the sale of tenths under Caius Norbanus. [The account of the sale of\n the tenths in the Leontine district under Caius Norbanus is read.] And yet, then, there were no trials about the return of acres; nor\n was Artemidorus Cornelius a judge, nor did a Sicilian magistrate exact from a\n cultivator whatever the farmer demanded; nor was it entreated as a favour from the\n farmer to be allowed to compound at three medimni \n an acre; nor was a cultivator obliged to give an additional present of money, nor to\n add three-fiftieths of corn. And yet a area, quantity of corn was sent to the Roman\n people. \n ",
                "117":"\n But what is the meaning of these fiftieths? what is the meaning of these\n additional presents of money? By what right, and, what is more, in what manner did\n you do this The cultivator gave the money. How or whence did he get it? If he had\n wished to be very liberal, he would have used a more heaped up measure, as men\n formerly used to do in the matter of the tenths, when they were sold by fair laws,\n and on fair terms. He gave the money. Where did he get it? from his corn? As if,\n while you were praetor, he had anything to sell. Something, then, must be taken from\n his principal, in order to add this pecuniary gratuity for Apronius to all the\n profit which he derived from the lands. The next thing is, Did they give it\n willingly or unwillingly? Willingly? They were very fond, I suppose, of Apronius.\n Unwillingly? How, then, were they compelled to do so, except by violence and\n ill-treatment? Again; that man, that most senseless man, in the selling of the\n tenths, caused additional sums to be added to every tenth. It was not much; he added\n two or three thousand sesterces . In the three years\n he made about five hundred thousand sesterces . He\n did this neither according to any precedent, nor by any right; nor did he make any\n return of that money; nor can any man ever imagine how he is going to defend himself\n against this petty charge. \n ",
                "118":"\n And, as this is the case, do you dare to say that you sold\n the tenths at a high price, when it is evident that you sold the property and\n fortunes of the cultivators, not for the cake of the Roman people, but with a view\n to your own gain. As if any steward, from a farm which had been used to produce ten\n thousand sesterces , having cut down and sold the\n trees, having taken away the buildings and the stock, and having driven off all the\n cattle, sent his master twenty thousand sesterces \n instead of ten, and made a hundred thousand more for himself. At first the master,\n not knowing the injury that had been done to him, would be glad, and be delighted\n with his steward, because he had got so much more profit out of the farm; but\n afterwards, when he heard that all those things on which the profit and cultivation\n of his farm depends have been removed and sold, he would punish his steward with the\n greatest severity, and think himself very ill used. So also, the Roman people, when\n it hears that Caius Verres has sold the tenths for more than that most innocent man,\n Caius Sacerdos, whom he succeeded, thinks that it has got a good steward and\n guardian over its lands and crops; but when it finds out that he has sold all the\n stock of the cultivators, all the resources of the revenue, and has destroyed all\n the hopes of their posterity by his avarice,—that he has devastated and drained the\n allotments and the Lands subject to tribute,—that he has made himself most enormous\n gain and booty,—it will perceive that it has been shamefully treated, and will think\n that man worthy of the severest punishment. \n ",
                "119":"\n By what, then, can this be made evident? Chiefly by this fact, that the land of\n the province of Sicily liable to the\n payment of tenths is deserted through the avarice of that man. Nor does it happen\n only that those who have remained on their lands are now cultivating a smaller\n number of acres, but also very many rich men, farmers on a large scale, and skillful\n men, have deserted large and productive farms, and abandoned their whole allotments.\n That may be very easily ascertained from the public documents of the states; because\n according to the law of Hiero the number of cultivators is every year entered in the\n books by public authority before the magistrates. Read now how many cultivators of\n the Leontine district there were when Verres took the government. Eighty-three. And\n how many made returns in his third year? Thirty-two. I see that there were fifty-one\n cultivators so entirely got rid of that they had no successors. How many cultivators\n were there of the district of Mutyca, when you arrived? Let us see from the public\n documents. A hundred and eighty-eight. How many in your third year? A hundred and\n one. That one district has to regret eighty-seven cultivators, owing to that man's\n ill-treatment, and to that extent our republic has to regret the loss of so many\n heads of families, and demands them back at his hand, since they are the real\n revenues of the Roman people. The district of Herbita had in his first year two\n hundred and fifty-seven cultivators; in his third, a hundred and twenty. From this\n region a hundred and thirty-seven heads of families have fled like banished men. The\n district of Agyrium—what men lived in that land! how honourable, how wealthy they\n were? —had two hundred and fifty cultivators in the first year of your praetorship.\n What had it in the third year? Eighty,—as you have heard the Agyrian deputies read\n from their public documents. \n ",
                "120":"\n O ye immortal gods! If you had driven away out of the whole of Sicily a hundred and seventy cultivators of the\n soil, could you, with impartial judges, escape condemnation? When the one district\n of Agyrium is less populous by a hundred\n and seventy cultivators, will not you, O judges, form your conjectures of the state\n of the whole province? And you will find nearly the same state of things in every\n district liable to the payment of tenths, and that those to whom anything has been\n left out of a large patrimony, have remained behind with a much smaller stock, and\n cultivating a much smaller number of acres, because they were afraid, if they\n departed, that they should lose all the rest of their fortunes; but as for those to\n whom he had left nothing remaining which they could lose, they have fled not only\n from their farms, but from their cities. The very men who have remained—scarcely a\n tenth part of the old cultivators of the soil—were about to leave all their lands\n too, if Metellus had not sent letters to them from Rome , saying that he would sell the tenths according to the law of\n Hiero; and if he had not entreated them to sow as much land as they could, which\n they had always done for their own sakes, when no one entreated them, as long as\n they understood that they were sowing, and labouring, and going to expense for\n themselves and for the Roman people,—not for Verres and Apronius. \n ",
                "121":"\n But now, O judges, if you neglect the fortunes of the Sicilians,—if you show no\n anxiety about the treatment the allies of the Roman people receive from our\n magistrates,—at all events undertake and defend the common cause of the Roman\n people. I say that the cultivators have been driven out,—that the lands subject to\n tribute have been devastated and drained by Verres—that the whole province has been\n depopulated and tyrannised over. All these things I prove by the public documents of\n the cities, and by the private evidence of most unimpeachable men. What would you have more? Do you wait\n till Lucius Metellus, who by his commands and by his power has deterred many\n witnesses from appearing against Verres shall himself, though absent, bear testimony\n to his wickedness, and dishonesty, and audacity? I think not. But he, who was his\n successor, has had the best opportunity of knowing the truth. That is true, but he\n is hindered by his friendship for him. Still, he ought to inform us accurately in\n what state the province is. He ought, still he is not forced to do so. \n ",
                "122":"\n Does any one require the evidence of Lucius Metellus against Verres? No one. Does\n any one demand it? I think not What, however, if I prove by the evidence and letters\n of Lucius Metellus that all these things are true? What will you say then? That\n Metellus writes falsely? or that he is desirous of injuring his friend? or that he,\n though he is praetor, does not know in what state the province is? Read the letters\n of Lucius Metellus, which he sent to Cnaeus Pompeius and Marcus Crassus, the\n consuls, those which he sent to Marcus Mummius, the praetor, those which he sent to\n the quaestors of the city. [The letter of Lucius Metellus is read.] “I sold the\n tenths according to the law of Hiero.” When he writes that he had sold them\n according to the law of Hiero, what is he writing? Why, that he had sold them as all\n others had done, except Verres. When he writes that he had sold them according to\n the law of Hiero, what is he writing? Why, that he had restored the privileges\n granted to the Sicilians by the kindness of our ancestors and taken away by Verres,\n and their rights, and the terms on which they became our allies and friends. He\n mentions at what price he sold the tenths of each district. After that what does he\n write? \n ",
                "123":"\n Read the rest of the letter.—“The greatest pains has been taken by me to sell the\n tenths for as good a price as possible.” Why then, O Metellus, did you not sell them\n for as much as Verres? “Because I found the allotments deserted, the fields empty,\n the province in a wretched and ruined condition.” What? And as for the land that was\n sown, how was any one found to sow it? Read the letters. [The letters are read.] He\n says that he had sent letters, and that, when he arrived, he had given a positive\n promise; he had interposed his authority to prevail on them, and had all but given\n hostages to the cultivators that he would be in no respect like Verres But what is\n this about which he says that he took so much pains? Read—“To prevail on the\n cultivators of the soil, who were left, to sow as largely as they could.” Who were\n left? What does this mean—left? After what war? after what devastation? What mighty\n slaughter was there in Sicily , or what was\n there of such duration and such disaster while you were praetor, that your successor\n had to collect and recover the cultivators who were left? \n ",
                "124":"\n When Sicily was harassed in the\n Carthaginian wars, and afterwards, in our fathers' and our own recollection, when\n great bands of fugitive slaves twice occupied the province, still there was no\n destruction of the cultivators of the soil; then, if the sowing was hindered, or the\n crop lost, the yearly revenue was lost too, but the number of owners and cultivators\n of the land remained undiminished. Then those officers who succeeded the praetors\n Marcus Laevinus, or Publius Rupilius, or Marcus Aquillius in that province, had not\n to collect the cultivators who were left. Did Verres and Apronius bring so much more\n distress on the province of Sicily than\n either Hasdrubal with his army of Carthaginians, or Athenio with his numerous bands\n of runaway slaves, that in those times, as soon as the enemy was subdued, all the\n land was ploughed, and the praetor had not to send letters to beg the cultivator to\n come to him, and entreat him to sow as much land as he could; but now, even after\n the departure of this most ill-omened pestilence, no one could be found who would\n till his land of his own free-will; and very few were left to return to their farms\n and their own familiar household gods, even when urged by the authority of Lucius\n Metellus? \n ",
                "125":"\n Do not you feel, O most audacious and most senseless of omen, that you are\n destroyed by these letters? Do you not see that, when your successor addresses those\n agriculturists who are left, he writes this in express words, that they are left,\n not after war or after any calamity of that sort, but after your wickedness, and\n tyranny, and avarice, and cruelty? Read the rest—“But still in such quantities as\n the difficulty of the times and the poverty of the cultivators permitted.” The\n poverty of the cultivators, he says. If I, as the accuser, were to dwell so\n repeatedly on the same subject, I should be afraid of wearying your attention, O\n judges; but Metellus cries out, “If I had not written letters.” That is not\n enough—“If I had not, when on the spot, assured them.” Even that is not enough—“The\n cultivators who were left,” he says. Left? In that mournful word he intimates the\n condition of nearly the whole province of Sicily . He adds, “the poverty of the cultivators.” \n ",
                "126":"\n Wait a little, O judges, wait a little, if you can, for confirmation of my speech.\n I say that the cultivators have been driven away by that man's avarice: Metellus\n writes word that those who were left have been reassured by him. I say that the\n fields have been abandoned, and the allotments deserted: Metellus writes word that\n there is great penury among the cultivators. When he writes this, he shows that the\n allies and friends of the Roman people have been cast down, and driven off, and\n stripped of all their fortunes; and yet if any calamity had happened to these men by\n his means, even without any injury to our revenues, you ought to punish him,\n especially while judging according to that law which was established for the sake of\n the allies. But when our allies are oppressed and ruined, and the revenues of the\n Roman people diminished at the same time,—when our supplies of corn and provisions,\n our wealth, and the safety of the city and of our armies for the future is destroyed\n by his avarice, at least have a regard to the advantage of the Roman people, if you\n have no anxiety to show your regard for our most faithful allies. \n ",
                "127":"\n And that you may be aware that man had no consideration for either the revenue or\n for our posterity, in comparison with present gain and booty, see what Metellus\n writes at the end:—“I have taken care of the revenues for the future.” He says that\n he has taken care of the revenues for the future. He would not write that he had\n taken care of the revenues, if he had not meant to show this, that you had ruined\n the revenues. For what reason was there for Metellus taking care for the future of\n the revenues in respect of the tenths, and of the whole corn interest, if that man\n had not diverted the revenues of the Roman people to his own profit And Metellus\n himself, who is taking care of the revenues for the future, who is reassembling the\n cultivators of the soil who are left, what does he effect but this, to make those\n men plough, if they can, to whom Verres's satellite Apronius has hardly left one\n plough remaining, but who yet remained on their land in the hope and expectation of\n Metellus? What more? What became of the rest of the Sicilians? What became of that\n numerous body of cultivators who were not only driven away from their farms, but who\n even fled from their cities, from the province, having had all their property and\n all their fortunes taken from them? By what means can they be recalled? How many\n praetors of incorruptible wisdom will be required to re-establish, in process of\n time, that multitude of cultivators in their farms and their habitations? \n ",
                "128":"\n And that you may not marvel that so great a multitude has fled, as you find, from\n the public documents and from the returns of the cultivators, has fled, know that\n his cruelty and wickedness towards the cultivators was so excessive, (it is an\n incredible statement to make, O judges, but it is both a fact, and one that is\n notorious over all Sicily ,) that men, on\n account of the insults and licentiousness of the collectors, actually killed\n themselves. It is proved that Diocles of Centuripa, a wealthy man, hung himself the\n very day that it was announced that Apronius had purchased the tenths. A man of high\n birth, Archonidas of Elorum, said that Dyrrachinus, the first man of his city, slew\n himself in the same way, when he heard that the collector had made a return, that,\n according to Verres's edict, he owed him a sum that he could not make good at the\n expense of all his property. Now you, though you always were\n the most dissolute and cruel of all mortals, still you never would have allowed,\n (because the groanings and lamentations of the province brought danger on your own\n head,)—you would never, I say, have allowed men to seek refuge from your injustice\n in hanging and death, if the matter had not tended to your profit and to your own\n acquisition of booty. \n ",
                "129":"\n What! would you have suffered it? Listen, O judges; for I must strive with all my\n sinews, and labour earnestly to make all men perceive how infamous, how evident, how\n undeniable a crime they are seeking to efface by means of money. This is a grave\n charge, a serious charge,—it is the most serious one which has been made in the\n memory of man, ever since trials for peculation and extortion were first\n instituted,—that a praetor of the Roman people has had collectors of the tenths for\n his partners. It is not\n the case that a private individual is now for the first time having this charge\n brought against him by an enemy, or a defendant by his accuser. Long ago, while\n sitting on his seat of justice as praetor, while he had the province of Sicily , when he was not only feared (as is common)\n on account of his absolute power, but also on account of its cruelty, (which is his\n especial characteristic,) he heard this charge urged against him a thousand times,\n when it was not carelessness which delayed him from avenging it, but the\n consciousness of his wickedness and avarice that kept him in check. For the\n collectors used to say openly, and, above all the rest, that one who had the\n greatest influence with him, and who was laying waste the most extensive districts,\n Apronius, that very little of these immense gains came to them, that the praetor was\n their partner. \n ",
                "130":"\n When the collectors were in the habit of saying this all over the province, and\n mixing up your name with so base and infamous a business, did it never come into\n your mind to take care of your own character? Did it never occur to you to look to\n your liberty and fortunes? When the terror of your name was constantly present to\n the ears and minds of the cultivators,—when the collectors made use, not of their\n own power, but of your wickedness and your name to compel the cultivators to come to\n terms with them,—Did you think that there would be any tribunal at Rome so profligate, so abandoned, so mercenary that\n any protection from its judgment would be found for you?—when it was notorious that,\n when the tenths had been sold contrary to the regulations, the laws, and the customs\n of all men, the collectors, while employed in seizing the property and fortunes of\n the cultivators, were used to say that the shares were yours, the affair yours, the\n plunder yours; and that you said nothing, and though you could not conceal that you\n were aware of it, were still able to bear and endure it, because the magnitude of\n the gain obscured the magnitude of the danger, and because the desire of money had a\n good deal more influence over you than the fear of judgment. \n ",
                "131":"\n Be it so; you cannot deny the rest. You have not even left yourself this resource,\n to be able to say that you heard nothing of this,—that no mention of your infamy\n ever came to your ears; for the cultivators were complaining with groans and tears.\n Did you not know it? The whole province was loud in its indignation. Did no one tell\n you of it? Complaints were being made of your injuries, and meetings held on the\n subject at Home,—were you ignorant of this? Were you ignorant of all these facts?\n What? when Publius Rubrius summoned Quintus Apronius openly at Syracuse in your hearing, at a great assembly\n of the people, to be bound over to stand a trial, offering to prove, “that Apronius\n had frequently said that you were his partner in the affair of the tenths.” Did not\n these words strike you? did they not agitate you? did they not arouse you to take\n care of your own liberty and fortunes? You were silent; you even pacified their\n quarrel; you took pains to prevent the trial from coming on. O ye immortal gods! could either an\n innocent man have endured this? or would not even a man ever so guilty, if it were\n only because he thought that there might be a trial at Rome hereafter, have endeavoured by some dissimulation to study his\n character in the eyes of men? \n ",
                "132":"\n What is the case? A wager is offered about a matter affecting your position as a\n free citizen, and your fortunes. Do you sit still and say nothing? do not you follow\n up the matter? do not you persevere? do not you ask to whom Apronius said it? who\n heard him? whence it arose? how it was stated to have happened If any one had\n whispered in your ear, and told you that Apronius was in the habit of saying that\n you were his partner, you ought to have been roused, to have summoned Apronius, and\n not to have been satisfied yourself with him, till you had satisfied the opinion of\n others with respect to yourself. But when in the crowded forum, in a great concourse\n of people, this charge was urged, in word and presence indeed, against Apronius, but\n in reality against you, could you ever have received such a blow in silence, unless\n you had decided that, say what you would in so evident a case, you would only make\n the matter worse? \n ",
                "133":"\n Many men have dismissed quaestors, lieutenants, prefects, and tribunes, and\n ordered them to leave the province, because they thought that their own reputation\n was being injured through their misconduct, or because they considered that they\n were behaving ill in some particular. Would you never have addressed Apronius, a man\n scarcely a free man, profligate, abandoned, infamous, who could not preserve, I will\n not say an honest mind, but not even a pure soul, with even one harsh word, and that\n too when smarting under disgrace and insult yourself? And moreover, the respect due\n to a partnership would not have been so sacred in your eyes as to make you\n indifferent to the danger you were in, if you had not seen the matter was so well\n known and so notorious to every one. \n ",
                "134":"\n Publius Scandilius, a Roman knight, whom you are all acquainted with, did\n afterwards adopt the same legal proceedings against this same Apronius respecting\n that partnership, which Rubrius had wished to adopt. He urged them on; he pressed\n it, he gave him no respite; security was given to the amount of five thousand\n sesterces ; Scandilius began to demand\n recuperators or a judge. \n Does not this wicked praetor seem to be hemmed in now within sufficiently narrow\n bounds in his own province, yes, and even on his own throne and tribunal; so that he\n must either while present and sitting on the bench allow a trial to proceed\n affecting his own liberty, or else confess that he must be convicted by every\n tribunal in the world? The trial is on this formula, “that Apronius says that you\n are his partner in the matter of the tenths.” The province is yours; you are\n present, judgment is demanded from you yourself. What do you do? What do you decree?\n You say that you will assign judges. You do well; though where will there be found\n judges of such courage as to dare, in his province, when the praetor himself is\n present, to decide in a manner not only contrary to his with, but adverse even to\n his fortunes? \n ",
                "135":"\n However, be it so; the case is evident; there was no one who did not say that he\n had heard this distinctly; all the most respectable men were most undoubted\n witnesses of it; there was no one in all Sicily who did not know that the tenths\n belonged to the praetor, no one who had not heard Apronius frequently say so;\n moreover, there was a fine body of settlers at Syracuse , many Roman knights, men of the highest consideration, out\n of which number the judges must be selected, who could not possibly decide in any\n other manner. Scandilius does not cease to demand judges; then that innocent man,\n who was so eager to efface that suspicion, and to remove it from himself, says that\n he will assign judges from his own retinue. \n ",
                "136":"\n In the name of the good faith of gods and men, who is it that I am accusing? in\n whose case am I not desirous that my industry and diligence should be proved? What\n is it that I sought to effect and obtain by speaking and meditating on this matter?\n I have hold, I have hold I say, in the middle of the revenues of the Roman people,\n in the very crops of the province of Sicily , of a thief, manifestly embezzling the whole revenue derived\n from the corn, an immense sum: I have hold of him; so I say that he cannot deny it.\n For what will he say? Security has been entered into for a prosecution against your\n agent Apronius, in a matter in which all your fortunes are at stake—on the charge of\n having been in the habit of saying that you were his partner in the tenths. All men\n are waiting to see how anxious you will be about this, how you will endeavour to\n give men a favourable opinion of you and of your innocence. Will you here appoint as\n judges your physician, and your soothsayer, and your crier, or even that man whom\n you had in your train, in case there was any affair of importance, a judge like\n Cassius, Papirius Potamo, a severe man of the old equestrian school? Scandilius\n began to demand judges from the body of settlers; then Verres says that he will not\n entrust a trial in which his own character is at stake, to any one except his own\n people. The brokers think it a scandalous thing for a man to protest against, as\n unjust to himself, that form in which they transact their business. The praetor\n protests against the whole province as unjust to him. \n ",
                "137":"\n Oh, unexampled impudence! Does he demand to be acquitted at Rome , who has decided in his own province that it\n is impossible that he should be acquitted? who thinks that money will have a greater\n influence over senators most carefully chosen, than fear will over three judges? But\n Scandilius says that he will not say a word before a judge like Artemidorus, and\n still he presses the matter on, and loads you with favourable conditions, if you\n choose to avail yourself of them. If you decide that, in the whole province of\n Sicily , no capable judge or recuperator\n can be found, he requires of you to refer the matter to Rome ; and on this you exclaim that the man is a\n dishonest man, for demanding a trial in which your character is at stake to take\n place in a place where he knows that you are unpopular. \n ",
                "138":"\n You say you will not send the case to Rome . You say that you will not appoint judges out of the body of\n settlers; you put forward your own retinue. Scandilius says that he shall abandon\n the whole affair for the present, and return at his own time. What do you say to\n that? what do you do? you compel Scandilius to do what? to prosecute the matter\n regularly? In a shameless manner you put an end to the long-expected trial of your\n character; you do not do that—what do you do, then? \n ",
                "139":"\n Do you permit Apronius to select what judges he chooses out of your retinue? It is\n a scandalous thing that you should give one of the parties a power of selecting\n judges from that worthless crew, rather than give both a power of rejecting judges\n from a respectable class. You do neither of those things—what then? Is there\n anything more abominable that can be done? Yes; for he compels Scandilius to give\n and pay over that five thousand sesterces to\n Apronius. What neater thing could be done by a praetor desirous of a fair\n reputation,—one who was anxious to repel from himself all suspicion, and to deliver\n himself from infamy? He\n had been a common topic of conversation, of reproach, of abuse. A worthless and\n debauched man had been in the habit of saying that the praetor was his partner. The\n master had come before the courts, had come to trial; he, upright and innocent man\n that he was, had an opportunity, by punishing Apronius, of relieving himself from\n the most serious disgrace. What punishment does he devise? what penalty for\n Apronius? He compels Scandilius to pay to Apronius five thousand sesterces , as reward and wages for his unprecedented\n rascality, his audacity, and his proclamation of this wicked partnership. \n ",
                "140":"\n What difference did it make, O most audacious man, whether you made this decree,\n or whether you yourself made that profession and declaration concerning yourself\n which Apronius was in the habit of making? The man whom, if there had been shame,\n yes, if there had even been any fear in you, you ought not to have let go without\n punishment, you could not allow to come off without a reward. You might see the\n truth in every case, O judges, from this single affair of Scandilius. First of all,\n that this charge about the partnership in the tenths was not cooked up at Rome , was not invented by the accuser; it was not\n (as we are accustomed sometimes to say in making a defence for a man) a domestic or\n back-stairs accusation; it was not originated in a time of your danger, but it was\n an old charge, bruited about long ago, when you were praetor, not made up at\n Rome by your enemies, but brought to\n Rome from the province. \n ",
                "141":"\n At the same time his great favour to Apronius may be clearly seen; also the, I\n will not say confession, but the boast of Apronius, about him. Besides all this, you\n can rake as clearly proved this first, that, in his own province, he would not\n entrust a trim in which his reputation was at stake, to any one out of his own\n retinue. Is there any\n judge who has not been convinced, from the very beginning of my accusation\n respecting the collection of tenths, that he had made an attack on the property and\n fortunes of the cultivators of the soil? Who is there who did not at once decide,\n from what I then proved, that he had sold the tenths under a law quite novel, and,\n therefore, no law at all, contrary to the usage and established regulations of all\n his predecessors? \n ",
                "142":"\n But even if I had not such judges as I have, such impartial, such careful, such\n conscientious judges, is there any one whatever who has not long ago formed his\n opinion and his judgment from the magnitude of the injuries done, the dishonesty of\n the decrees, the iniquity of the tribunals? Even although a man may be somewhat\n careless in judging,—somewhat indifferent to the laws, to his duty to the republic,\n to our allies and friends, what then? Can even such a man doubt of the dishonesty of\n that man, when he is aware that such vast gains were made,—such iniquitous\n compromises extorted by violence and terror?—when he knows that cities were\n compelled by violence and imperious commands, by the fear of scourges and death, to\n give such great rewards, not only to Apronius and to men like him, but even to the\n slaves of Venus? \n ",
                "143":"\n But if any one is but little influenced by the injuries done to our allies,—if\n there be any one who is not moved by the flight, the calamities, the banishment, and\n the suicides of the cultivators of the soil; still I cannot doubt that the man who\n knows, both from the documents of the cities and the letter of Lucius Metellus, that\n Sicily has been laid waste and the farms\n deserted, must decide that it is quite impossible that any other than the severest\n judgment should be passed on that man. Will there be any one who can conceal from\n himself, or be indifferent to these facts? I have brought before you trials\n commenced respecting the partnership in the tenths, but prevented by that man from\n being brought to a decision. What is there that any one can possibly desire plainer\n than this? I have no doubt that I have satisfied you, O judges. But I will go\n further; not, indeed, in order that this may be proved more completely to your\n satisfaction than I feel sure that it already is, but that he may at last give over\n his impudence,—may cease at Last to believe that he can purchase these things which\n he himself was always ready to sell his good faith, his oath, truth, duty, and\n religion;—that his friends may cease to keep continually saying things which may be\n injury, a stain, and odium, and infamy to all of us. \n ",
                "144":"\n But what friends are they? Alas, the order of senators! wretched, and unpopular,\n and detested through the fault and unworthiness of a few! That Alba Aemilius,\n sitting at the entrance of the market, should say openly that Verres had gained his\n cause,—that he had bought the judges, one for four hundred thousand sesterces , another for five, the one who who went\n cheapest, for three! And when he was answered that that was impossible; that many\n witnesses would give evidence, and besides, that I should not desert the\n cause,—“Though,” said he, “every one were to make every possible statement against\n him, still, unless the matter be brought home to him so evidently that no answer can\n be given, we have gained the cause.” \n ",
                "145":"\n You say well, Alba. I will agree to your conditions. You think that conjecture\n avails nothing at a trial,—that suspicion avails nothing,—that the character of\n one's previous life avails nothing,—nor the evidence of virtuous men,—nor the\n authority or letters of cities. You demand evident proof I do not ask for judges\n like Cassius. I do not ask for the ancient impartiality of courts of justice. I do\n not, O judges, implore your good faith, your self-respect, your conscientiousness in\n giving judgment. I will take Alba for my judge; that man who is himself desirous of\n being considered an unprincipled buffoon: who by the buffoons has always been\n considered as a gladiator, rather than as a buffoon. I will bring forward such a\n case about the tenths that Alba shall confess that Verres, in the case of the corn,\n and in that of the property of the cultivators of the soil has been an open and\n undisguised robber. \n ",
                "146":"\n He says that he sold the tenths of the Leontine district at a high price. I showed\n at the beginning that he ought not to be considered to have sold them at a high\n price' who in name indeed sold the tenths, but who in reality and by the terms of\n the sale, and through his law, and through his edict, and through the licentiousness\n of the collectors, left no tenths at all to the cultivators of the soil. I proved\n that also, that others had sold the tenths of the Leontine district and of other\n districts also, for a high price; and that they had sold them according to the law\n of Hiero; and that they sold them for even more than you had, and that then no\n cultivator had complained. Nor indeed was there anything of which any one could\n complain, when they were sold according to a law most equitably framed; nor did it\n ever make any difference to the cultivator at what price the tenths were sold. For\n it is not the case that, if they be sold at a high price, the cultivator owes more,\n if at a low price, less. As the crops are produced, so are the tenths sold. But it\n is for the interest of the cultivator, that his crops should be such that the tenths\n may be able to be sold at as high a price as possible. As long as the cultivator\n does not give more than a tenth, it is for his interest that the tenth should be as\n large as possible. \n ",
                "147":"\n But, I imagine, you mean this to be the chief article of your defence, that you\n sold all the tenths at a high price, but the tenths of the Leontine district, which\n produces the most, for two hundred and sixteen thousand modii of wheat. If I prove that you could have sold them for a good\n deal more, but that you would not knock them down to those who were bidding against\n Apronius, and that you adjudged them to Apronius for much less than you might have\n adjudged them to others;—if I prove this, will even Alba, not only your oldest\n friend, out even your lover, be able to acquit you? I assert that a Roman knight, a man of the highest\n honour, Quintus Minucius, with others like himself, was willing to add to the tenths\n of the Leontine district not one thousand, not two thousand, not three thousand\n modii of wheat, but thirty thousand modii of wheat to the tenths of one single district, and\n that he was not allowed to become the purchaser, that the matter might not escape\n the grasp of Apronius. \n ",
                "148":"\n You cannot by any means deny this, unless you are determined to deny everything.\n The business was transacted openly, in a full assembly, at Syracuse . The whole province is the witness,\n because men are accustomed to flock together thither from all parts at the sale or\n the tenths. And whether you confess this, or whether it be proved against you, do\n you not see in what important and what evident acts you are detected. First of all,\n it is proved that that business and that booty was yours. For unless it was, why did\n you prefer that Acronius (who every one was saying was only managing your affairs in\n the matter of the tenths as your agent) should get the tenths of the Leontine\n district rather than Quintus Minucius? Secondly, that an enormous and immense profit\n was made by you. For if you would not have been influenced by thirty thousand\n modii of wheat, at all events Minucius would\n willingly have given thus much as a compliment to Apronius, if he had been willing\n to accept it. \n ",
                "149":"\n How great then must we suppose the expectation of booty which he entertained to\n have been, when he despised and scorned such vast present profit: acquired without\n the slightest trouble. Thirdly, Minucius himself would never have wished to have\n them at such a price, if you had been selling the tenths according to the Law of\n Hiero; but because he saw that by your new edicts and most iniquitous resolutions he\n should get a good deal more than tenths, on that account he advanced higher. But\n Apronius had always even a good deal more permitted to him than you had announced in\n your edict. How much gain then can we suppose was made by him to whom everything was\n permitted; when that man was so willing to add so large a compliment, who would not\n have had the same licence if he had bought the tenths? \n ",
                "150":"\n Lastly, unquestionably that defence, under which you have constantly thought that\n all your thefts and iniquities could be concealed, is cut from under your feet; that\n you sold the tenths at a high price—that you consulted the interest of the Roman\n people—that you provided for plenty of provisions. He cannot say this, who cannot\n deny that he sold the tenths of one district for thirty thousand modii less than he might have done; even if I were to\n grant you this, that you did not grant them to Minucius because you had already\n adjudged them to Apronius; for they say that that is what you are in the habit of\n saying, and I am expecting to hear it, and I wish you would make that defence. But,\n even if it were so, still you cannot boast of this as a great thing, that you sold\n the tenths at a high price, when you admit that there were people who were willing\n to buy them at a much higher price. \n ",
                "151":"\n The avarice, then, and covetousness of this man, his wickedness, and dishonesty,\n and audacity, are proved, O judges, are proved most incontestably. What more shall I\n say What if his own friends and defenders have formed the same opinion that I have?\n What can you have more? On the arrival of Lucius Metellus the praetor, when Verres\n had made all his retinue friends of this also by that sovereign medicine of his,\n money, men applied to Metellus; Apronius was brought before him; his accuser was a\n man of the highest consideration, Caius Gallius, a senator. He demanded of Metellus\n to give him a right of action according to the terms of his edict against Apronius,\n “for having taken away property by force or by fear,” which formula of Octavius,\n Metellus had both adopted at Rome , and now\n imported into the province. He does not succeed; as Metellus said that he did not\n wish by means of such a trial to prejudge the case of Verres himself in a matter\n affecting his condition as a free citizen. The whole retinue of Metellus, grateful\n men, stood by Apronius. Caius Gallius, a man of our order, cannot obtain from Lucius\n Metellus, his most intimate friend, a trial in accordance with his own edict. \n ",
                "152":"\n I do not blame Metellus; he spared a friend of his—a connection, indeed, as I have\n heard him say himself. I do not, I say, blame Metellus; but I do marvel how he not\n only prejudged the case of a man concerning whom he was unwilling that any previous\n decision should take place by means of judges, but even judged most severely and\n harshly respecting him. For, in the first place, if he thought that Apronius would\n be acquitted, there was no reason for his fearing any previous decision. In the\n second place, if Apronius were condemned, all men were likely to think that the\n cause of Verres was involved in his; this at all events Metellus did now decide, and\n he determined that their affairs and their causes were identical, since he\n determined that, if Apronius were condemned, it would be a prejudging of the case of\n Verres. And one fact is at the same time a proof of two things; both that the\n cultivators gave much more than they owed to Apronius because they were constrained\n by violence and fear; and also, that Apronius was transacting Verres's business in\n his own name, since Lucius Metellus determined that Apronius could not be condemned\n without giving a decision at the same time respecting the wickedness and dishonesty\n of Verres. \n ",
                "153":"\n I come now to the letter of Timarchides, his freedman and attendant; and when I\n have spoken of that, I shall have finished the whole of my charge respecting the\n truth This is the letter, O judges, which we found at Syracuse , in the house of Apronius, where we\n were looking for letters. It was sent, as it proves itself, on the journey, when\n Verres had already departed from the province; written by the hand of Timarchides\n Read the letter of Timarchides: “Timarchides, the officer of Verres, wishes health\n to Apronius.” Now I do not blame this which he has written, “The officer.” For why should clerks alone assume to themselves this privilege?\n “Lucius Papirius the clerk,” I should like this signature to be common to all\n attendants, lictors, and messengers. “Be sure and be very diligent in everything which concerns the\n praetor's character.” He recommends Verres to Apronius, and exhorts him to resist\n his enemies; Your reputation is protected by a very efficient guard, if indeed it\n depends on the diligence and authority of Apronius. “You have virtue and eloquence.”\n \n ",
                "154":"\n How abundantly Apronius is praised by Timarchides! How splendidly! Whom ought I to\n expect to be otherwise than pleased with that man who is so highly approved by\n Timarchides? “You have ample funds.” It is quite inevitable that what there was\n superfluous of the gain you both made by the corn, must have gone chiefly to the man\n by whose intervention you transacted that business. “Get hold of the new clerks and\n officers. —Use every means that\n offer, in concert with Lucius Vulteius, who has the greatest influence.” See now,\n what an opinion Timarchides has of his own dishonest cunning, when he gives precepts\n of dishonesty to Apronius! Now these words, “Use every means in your power ” —Does not he seem to be drawing words out of his\n master's house, suited to every sort of iniquity? “I beg, my brother, that you will\n trust your own little brother,” your comrade, indeed, in gain and robbery, your\n twin-brother and image in worthlessness, dishonesty, and audacity. “You will be considered dear to the\n retinue.” What does this mean, “to the retinue?” What has that to do with it? Are\n you teaching Apronius? What? had he come into this retinue at your prompting, or of\n his own accord? “Whatever is needful for each man, that employ.” How great, do you\n suppose, must have been the impudence of that man when in power, who even after his\n departure is so shameless? He says that everything can be done by money: you must\n give, waste, and spend, if you wish to gain your cause. Even this, that Timarchides\n should give this advice to Apronius, is not so offensive to me, as the fact of his\n also giving it to his patron: “When you press a request, all men gain their\n objects.” \n ",
                "155":"\n Yes, while Verres was praetor, not while Sacerdos was, or Peducaeus, or this very\n Lucius Metellus. “You know that Metellus is a wise man.” But this is really\n intolerable, that the abilities of that most excellent man, Lucius Metellus, should\n be laughed at, and despised and scorned by that runaway slave Timarchides. “If you\n have Vulteius with you, everything will be mere child's play to you.” Here\n Timarchides is greatly mistaken, in thinking either that Vulteius can be corrupted\n by money, or that Metellus is going to discharge the duties of his praetorship\n according to the will of any one man; but he is mistaken by forming his conjectures\n from his own experience. Because he saw that, through his own intervention and that\n of others, many men had been able to do whatever they pleased with Verres, without\n meeting with any difficulty, he thought that there were the same means of access to\n every one. You did very easily whatever you wanted with Verres, and found it as easy\n as child's play to do so, because you knew many of the kinds of play in which he\n indulged. “Metellus and Vulteius have been impressed with the idea that you have\n ruined the cultivators of the soil.” Who attributed the action to Apronius, when he\n had ruined any cultivator? or to Timarchides when he had taken money for assigning a\n trial, or making a decree, or giving any order, or remitting any thing? or to Sextus\n the lictor, when he, as executioner, had put an innocent man to death? No one. Every\n body at the time attributed these things to Verres; whom they desire now to see\n condemned. \n ",
                "156":"\n “People have dinned into their ears, that you were a partner of the praetor's.” Do\n you not see how clear the matter both is and was when even Timarchides is afraid of\n this? Will you not admit that we are not inventing this charge against you, but that\n your freedman has been this long time seeking some defence against this charge? Your\n freedman and officer, one most intimate, and indeed connected with you and your\n children in everything, writes to Apronius, that it is universally pointed out to\n Metellus that Apronius had been your partner in the tenths. “Make him see the\n dishonesty of the cultivators: they shall suffer for it, if the gods will.” What, in\n the name of the immortal gods, is the meaning of that? or on what account can we say\n that such great and bitter hatred is excited against the cultivators? What injury\n have the cultivators of the soil done to Verres, that even his freedman and officer\n should attack them with so inimical a disposition in these letters? And I would not, O judges, have\n read to you the letter of this runaway slave, if I had not wished you to see from it\n the precepts, and customs, and system of the whole household. Do you see how he\n advises Apronius? by what means and by what presents he may insinuate himself into\n the intimacy of Metellus? how he may corrupt Vulteius? how he may win over with\n bribes the clerks and the chief officer? He teaches him what he has himself seen\n done. He teaches a stranger the lessons which he has learnt at home himself. But in\n this one thing he makes a mistake, that he thinks there is the same road to every\n one's intimacy. \n ",
                "157":"\n Although I am deservedly angry with Metellus, still I will say this which is true.\n Apronius could not corrupt Metellus with bribes, as he had corrupted Verres, nor\n with banquets, nor with women, nor with debauched and profligate conversation, by\n which means he had, I will not say crept into that man's friendship slowly and\n gradually, but had in a very short time got possession of the whole man and his\n whole retinue. But as for the retinue of Metellus, which he speaks of, what was the\n use of his corrupting that, when no judges were appointed out of it to judge the\n causes of the cultivators? \n ",
                "158":"\n For as for what he writes, that the son of Metellus was a mere boy, he is greatly\n mistaken. For there is not the same access to the son of every praetor. O\n Timarchides, the son of Metellus is in the province, not a boy, but a virtuous and\n modest youth, worthy of his rank and name. How that boy of yours had behaved in the\n province, I would not say if I thought it the fault of the boy, and not the fault of\n his father. Did not you, though you knew yourself and your own habits of life, O\n Verres, take with you your son, still clad in the robes of a boy, into Sicily , so that even if nature had separated the boy\n from his father's vices and from every resemblance to his family, still habit and\n training might prevent his degenerating from them? \n ",
                "159":"\n Suppose there had been in him the disposition of Caius Laelius, of Marcus Cato,\n still what good could be expected or extracted out of one who has lived in the\n licentious school of his father in such a way that he has never seen one modest or\n sober banquet? who since he has grown up has lived in daily revels for three years\n among immodest women and intemperate men? who has never heard a word from his father\n by which he might become more modest or more virtuous? who has never seen his father\n do anything, which, if he had imitated, would not have laid him under the most\n disgraceful imputation of all, that of being considered like his father? \n ",
                "160":"\n By which conduct you have done an injury, not only to your son, but also to the\n republic. For you had begotten children, not for yourself alone, but also for your\n country; who might not only be a pleasure to you, but who might some day or other be\n able to be of use to the republic. You ought to have trained and educated them\n according to the customs of your ancestors, and the established system of the state;\n not in your crimes, in your infamy. Were he the able, and modest, and upright son of\n a lazy, and debauched, and worthless father then the republic would have had a\n valuable present from you. Now you have given to the state another Verres instead of\n yourself, if, indeed, he is not worse (If that be possible) in this respect,—that\n you have turned out such as you are without being bred up in the school of a\n dissolute man, but only under a thief, and a go-between. \n \n ",
                "161":"\n What can we expect likely to turn out more complete than a person who is by nature\n your son, by education your pupil, by inclination your copyist? Whom, however, I, O\n judges, would gladly see turn out a virtuous and gallant man. For I am not\n influenced by his enmity, if, indeed, there is to be enmity between him and me; for\n if I am innocent and like myself in everything, how will his enmity hurt me? And if,\n in any respect, I am like Verres, an enemy will no more be wanting to me than he has\n been wanting to him. In truth, O judges, the republic ought to be such, and shall be\n such, being established by the impartiality of the tribunals, that an enemy shall\n never be wanting to the guilty, and shall never be able to injure the innocent.\n There is, therefore, no cause why I should not be glad for that son of his to emerge\n out of his father's vices and infamy. And although it may be difficult, yet I do not\n know whether it be impossible; especially if (as is at present the case) the\n guardians placed over him by his friends continue to watch him, since his father is\n so indifferent to him, and so dissolute. \n ",
                "162":"\n But my speech has now digressed more than I had intended from the letter of\n Timarchides: and I said, that when that had been read, I would end all I had to say\n on the charge connected with the tenths; from which you have clearly seen that an\n incalculable amount of corn has been for these three years diverted from the\n republic, and taken illegally from the cultivators. The next thing is, O judges, for me to explain to you\n the charge about the purchase of corn, a theft very large in amount, and exceedingly\n shameless. And I entreat you to listen while I briefly lay before you my statements,\n being both certain, few in number, and important. It was Verres's duty according to\n a decree of the senate, and according to the law of Terentius and to the law of\n Cassius about corn, to purchase corn in Sicily . There were two descriptions of purchase,—the one the purchase\n of the second tenths, the other the purchase of what was furnished in fair\n proportions by the different cities. Of corn derived from the second tenths the\n quantity would be as much as had been derived from the first tenths; of corn levied\n on the cities in this way there would be eight hundred thousand modii . The price fixed for the corn collected as the\n second tenths was three sesterces a modius ; for that furnished in compliance with the levy,\n four sesterces . Accordingly, for the corn furnished\n in compliance with the levy, there was paid to Verres each year three million two\n hundred thousand sesterces , which he was to pay to\n the cultivators of the soil; and for the second tenths, about nine millions of\n sesterces . And so, during the three years, there\n was nearly thirty-six million six hundred thousand sesterces paid to him for this purchase of corn in Sicily . \n ",
                "163":"\n This enormous sum of money, given to you out of a poor and exhausted treasury;\n given to you for corn,—that is to say, for what was necessary for the safety and\n life of the citizens; given to you to be paid to the Sicilian cultivators of the\n soil, on whom the republic was imposing such great burdens;—this great sum, I say,\n was so handled by you, that I can prove, if I choose, that you appropriated the\n whole of this money, and that it all went to your own house. In fact, you managed\n the whole affair in such a way that this which I say can be proved to the most\n impartial judge. But I will have a regard for my own authority, I will recollect\n with what feelings, with what intentions I have undertaken the advocacy of this\n public cause. I will not deal with you in the spirit of an accuser; I will invent\n nothing; I do not wish any one to take for proved, while I am speaking, anything of\n which I myself do not already feel thoroughly convinced. \n ",
                "164":"\n In the ease of this public money, O judges, there are three kinds of thefts. In\n the first place, he put it out among the companies from which it had been drawn at\n twenty-four per cent interest; in the second place, he paid actually\n nothing at all for corn to very many of the cities; lastly, if he did pay any city,\n he deducted as large a sum as ever he chose. He paid no one whatever as much as was\n due to him. And first I\n ask you this—you, to whom the farmers of the revenue, according to the letters of\n Carpinatius, gave thanks. Was the public money, drawn from the treasury, given out\n of the revenues of the Roman people to purchase corn, was it a source of profit to\n you? Did it bring you in twenty-four per cent interest? I dare say you will deny it.\n For it is a disgraceful and dangerous confession to make. \n ",
                "165":"\n And it is a thing very difficult for me to prove, for by what witnesses am I to\n prove it? By the farmers of the revenue? They have been treated by him with great\n honour they will keep silence. By their letters? They have been put out of the way\n by a resolution of the collectors. Which way then shall I turn? Shall I leave\n unmentioned so infamous a business, a crime of such audacity and such shamelessness,\n on account of a dearth of witnesses or of documentary proofs? I will not do so, O\n judges, I will call a witness. Whom? Lucius Vettius Chilo, a most honourable and\n accomplished man of the equestrian order, who is such a friend of and so closely\n connected with Verres, that, even if he were not an excellent man, still whatever he\n said against him would seem to have great weight; but who is so good a man that,\n even if he were ever so great an enemy to him, yet his testimony ought to be\n believed. \n ",
                "166":"\n He is annoyed and waiting to see what Vettius will say. He will say nothing\n because of this present occasion; nothing of his free will, nothing of which we can\n think that he might have spoken either way. He sent letters into Sicily to Carpinatius, when he was superintendent of\n the tax derived from the pasture lands, and manager of that company of farmers,\n which letters I found at Syracuse , in\n Carpinatius's house, among the portfolios of letters which had been brought to him;\n and at Rome in the house of Lucius\n Tullius, an intimate friend of yours, and another manager of the company, in\n portfolios of letters which had been received by him. And from these letters\n observe, I pray you, the impudence of this man's usury. [The letters of Lucius\n Vettius to Publius Servilius, and to Caius Antistius, managers of the company, are\n read.] Vettius says that he will be with you, and will take\n notice how you make up your accounts for the treasury; so that, if you do not\n restore to the people this money which has been put out at interest, you shall\n restore it to the company. \n ",
                "167":"\n Can we not establish what we assert by this witness, can we not establish it by\n the letters of Publius Servilius and Caius Antistius, managers of the company, men\n of the highest reputation and of the highest honour, and by the authority of the\n company whose letters we are using? or must we seek for something on which we can\n rely more, for something more important? Vettius, your most intimate friend,—Vettius, your\n connection, to whose sister you are married,—Vettius, the brother of your wife, the\n brother of your quaestor, bears witness to your most infamous theft, to your most\n evident embezzlement; for by what other name is a lending of the public money at\n usury to be called? Read what follows. He says that your clerk, O Verres, was the\n drawer up of the bond for this usury: the managers threaten him also in their\n letters; in fact, it happened by chance that two managers were with Vettius. They\n think it intolerable that twenty-four per cent should be taken from them, and they\n are right to think so. For whoever did such a thing before? who ever attempted to do\n such a thing,—who ever thought that such a thing could be done, as for a magistrate\n to venture to take money as interest from the farmers, though the senate had often\n assisted the farmers by remitting the interests due from them? Certainly that man\n could have no hope of safety, if the farmers—that is, the Roman knights, were the\n judges. \n ",
                "168":"\n He ought to have less hope now, O judges, now that you have to decide; and so much\n the less, in proportion as it is more honourable to be roused by the injuries of\n others than by one's own. What reply do you think of making to all this? Will you\n deny that you did it? Will you defend yourself on the ground that it was lawful for\n you to do it? How can you deny it? Can you deny it, to be convicted by the authority\n of such important letters, by so many farmers appearing as witnesses? But how can\n you say it was lawful? In truth, if I were to prove that you, in your own province,\n had lent on usury your own money, and not the money of the Roman people, still you\n could not escape; but when I prove that you lent the public money, the money decreed\n to you to buy corn with, and that you received interest from the farmers, will you\n make any one believe that this was lawful? a deed than which not only others have\n never, but you yourself have never done a more audacious or more infamous one. I\n cannot, in truth, O judges, say that even that which appears to me to be perfectly\n unprecedented, and about which I am going to speak next—I mean, the fact of his\n having actually paid very many cities nothing at all for their corn—was either more\n audacious or more impudent; the booty derived from this act was perhaps greater, but\n the impudence of the other was certainly not less. \n ",
                "169":"\n And since I have said enough about this lending at interest, now, I pray you, give\n your attention to the question of the embezzlement of the whole sum in many\n instances. There are many\n cities in Sicily , O judges, of great\n splendour and of high reputation, and among the very first of these is the city of\n Halesa. You will find no city more faithful to its duties, more rich in wealth, more\n influential in its authority. After that man had ordered it to furnish every year\n sixty thousand modii of wheat, he took money for\n the wheat, at the price which wheat bore in Sicily at the time; all the money which he thus received from the\n public treasury, he kept for himself. I was amazed, O judges, when a man of the\n greatest ability, of the highest wisdom, and of the greatest influence, Aeneas of\n Halesa, first stated this to me at Halesa in the senate of Halesa; a man to whom the\n senate by public resolution had given a charge to return me and my brother thanks,\n and at the same time to explain to us the matters which concerned this trial. \n ",
                "170":"\n He proves to me that this was his constant custom and system; that, when the\n entire quantity of corn had been brought to him under the name of tenths, then he\n was accustomed to exact money from the cities, to object to the corn delivered, and\n as for all the corn which he was forced to send to Rome , he sent that quantity from his own profits and from his own\n store of corn. I demand the accounts, I inspect the documents, I see that the people\n of Halesa, from whom sixty thousand modii had bees\n levied, had given none, that they had paid money to Volcatus, and to Timarchides the\n clerk. I find a case of plunder of this kind, O judges, that the praetor, whose duty\n it was to buy corn, did not buy it, but sell it; and that he embezzles and\n appropriates the money which he ought to have divided among the cities. It did not\n appear to me any longer to be a theft, but a monster and a prodigy; to reject the\n corn of the cities, and to approve of his own; when he had approved of his own, then\n to put a price on that corn, to take from the cities what he had fixed, and to\n retain what he had received from the Roman people. \n ",
                "171":"\n How many degrees of offence in one single act of fraud do you think will be\n enough, if I insist on them severally, to bring the matter to a point where he can\n go no further? You reject the Sicilian corn; why? because you are sending some\n yourself. Have you any Sicily of your own,\n which can supply you corn of another sort? When the senate decrees that corn he\n bought in Sicily , or when the people order\n this, this, as I imagine, is what they mean, that Sicilian corn is to be brought\n from Sicily . When you reject all the corn\n of Sicily , do you send corn to Rome from Egypt or from Syria ? You\n reject the corn of Halesa, of Cephalaedis, of Thermae, of Amestras, of Tyndaris , of Herbita, and of many other cities.\n What has happened then to cause the lands of these people to bear corn of such a\n sort while you were praetor, as they never bore before, so that it can neither be\n approved of by you, nor by the Roman people; especially when the managers of the\n different companies had taken corn, being the tenths, from the same land, and of the\n same year, to Rome ? What has happened that\n the corn which made part of the tenths was approved, and that that which was bought,\n though out of the same barn, was not approved of? Is there any doubt that all that\n rejection of corn was contrived with the object of raising money? \n ",
                "172":"\n Be it so. You reject the corn of Halesa, you have corn from another tribe which\n you approve of. Buy that which pleases you; dismiss those whose corn you have\n rejected. But from those whom you reject you exact such sum of money as may be\n equivalent to the quantity of corn which you require of their city. Is there any\n doubt what your object has been? I see from the public documents that the people of\n Halesa gave you fifteen sesterces for every\n medimnus—I will prove from the accounts of the wealthiest of the cultivators, that\n at the same time no one in Sicily sold corn\n at a higher price. What,\n then, is the reason for your rejecting, or rather what madness is it to reject corn\n which comes from that place from which the senate and the people of Rome ordered it to be brought? which comes from\n that very heap, a part of which, under the name of tenths, you had actually approved\n of? and besides, to exact money from the cities for the purchase of cow, when you\n had already received it from the treasury? Did the Terentian law enjoin you to buy\n corn from the Sicilians with the money of the Sicilians, or to buy corn from the\n Sicilians with the money of the Roman people? \n ",
                "173":"\n But now you see that all that money out of the treasury, which ought to have been\n given to these cities for corn, has been made profit of by that man. For you take\n fifteen sesterces for a medimus of wheat; for that is the value of a medimus at that time. You keep eighteen sesterces ; for that is the price of Sicilian corn, estimated according\n to law. What difference does it make whether you did this, or whether you did not\n reject the corn, but, after the corn was approved and accepted, detained all the\n public money, and paid none to any city whatever? when the valuation of the law is\n such that while it is tolerable to the Sicilians at other times, it ought also to be\n pleasant to them during your praetorship. For a modius is valued by law at three sesterces . But, while you were praetor, it was, as you boast in many\n letters to your friends, valued at two sesterces .\n But suppose it was three sesterces , since you\n exacted that price from the cities for every modius . When, if you had paid the Sicilians as much as the Roman people\n had ordered you to pay, it might have been most pleasing to the cultivators, you not\n only did not choose them to receive what they ought, but you even compelled them to\n pay what was not due from them. \n ",
                "174":"\n And that these things were done in this manner, you may know, O judges, both from\n the public documents of the cities, and from their public testimonies; in all which\n you will find nothing false, nothing invented as suited to the times. Everything\n which we speak of is entered in the returns and made up in a regular manner, without\n any interpolations or irregularities being foisted into the people's accounts, but\n while they are all made up with deliberation and accuracy. Read the accounts of the\n people of Halesa. To whom does he say that money was paid? Speak, speak, I say, a\n little louder. “To Volcatius, to Timarchides, to Maevius.” What is all this, O Verres? have you not\n left yourself even this argument in your defence, that they are the managers of the\n companies who have been concerned in those matters? that they are the managers who\n have rejected the corn? that they are the managers who have settled the affair with\n the cities for money? and that it is they also who have taken money from you in the\n name of those cities? and, moreover, that they have bought corn for themselves; and\n that all these things do not at all concern you? It would, in truth, be an\n insufficient and a wretched defence for a praetor to say this, “I never touched the\n corn, I never saw it, I gave the managers of the companies the power of approving of\n rejecting it; the managers extorted money from the cities but I paid to the managers\n the money which I ought to have paid to the people.” \n ",
                "175":"\n This is, as I have said, an insufficient, or rather, a profligate defence against\n an accusation. But still, even this one, if you were to wish to use it, you cannot\n use. Volcatius, the delight of yourself and your friends, forbids you to make\n mention of the manager; and Timarchides, the prop of your household, stops the mouth\n of your defence; who, as well as Volcatius, had money paid to him from the cities.\n But now your clerk, with that golden ring of his, which he procured out of these\n matters, will not allow you to avail yourself of that argument. What then remains\n for you, except to confess that you sent to Rome corn which had been bought with the money of the Sicilians? that\n you appropriated the public money to your own purposes? O you habit of sinning, what\n delight you afford to the wicked and the audacious, when chastisement is afar off,\n and when impunity attends you! \n ",
                "176":"\n This is not the first time that that man has been guilty of that sort of\n peculation, but now for the first time is he convicted. We have seen money paid to\n him from the treasury, while he was quaestor, for the expense of a consular army; we\n saw, a few months afterwards, both army and consul stripped of everything All that\n money lay hid in that obscurity and darkness which at that time had seized upon the\n whole republic. After that, he discharged the duties of the quaestorship to which he\n succeeded under Dolabella. He embezzled a vast sum of money; but he mixed up his\n accounts of that money with the confusion consequent on the conviction of Dolabella.\n Immense sums of money were entrusted to him when praetor. You will not find him a\n man to lick up these most infamous profits nervously and gently; he did not hesitate\n to swallow up at a gulp the whole of the public money. That wicked covetousness,\n when it is implanted in a man's nature, creeps on in such a way, when the habit of\n sinning has emancipated itself from restraint, that it is not able to put any limits\n to its audacity. \n ",

There is in\n truth also another new feature in this crime, O judges, which will remove all doubts\n as to his criminality on the former charge respecting the tenths. For, to say\n nothing of this fact, that very many of the cultivators of the soil had not corn\n enough for the second tenths, and for those eight thousand modii which they were bound to sell to the Roman people, but that they\n bought them of your agent, that is, of Apronius; which is a clear proof that you had\n left the cultivators actually nothing: to pass over this, which teas been clearly\n set forth in many men's evidence, can anything be more certain than this,—that all\n the corn of Sicily , and all the crops of\n the land liable to the payment of tenths, were for three years in your power and in\n your barns? \n ",

And what is sealing money How has this name got introduced\n into the accounts of a magistrate? how came it to be connected with the public\n money? For the third description of deduction was such as if it were not only\n lawful, but even proper; and not only proper, but absolutely necessary. Two\n fiftieths were deducted from the entire sum in the name of the clerk. Who gave you\n leave to do this?—what law? what authority of the senate?

Why should I go back to old times? or why should I\n make mention of those clerks, who, it is evident, were most upright and\n conscientious men? It does not escape my observation, O judges, that old examples\n are now listened to and considered as imaginary fables I will go only to the present\n wretched and profligate time. You, O Hortensius, have lately been quaestor. You can\n say what your clerks did; I say this of mine; when, in that same Sicily , I was paying the cities money for their\n corn, and had with me two most economical men as clerks, Lucius Manilius and Lucius\n Sergius, then I say that not only these two fiftieths were not deducted, but that\n not one single coin was deducted from any one.

                "187":"\n I have spoken, O judges, of the corn collected as tenths; I have spoken of that\n which was purchased; the last, the only remaining topic, is the valuation of the\n corn, which ought to have weight with every one, both from the vastness of the sum\n involved, and from the description of the injustice done; and more than either,\n because against this charge he is provided, not with some ingenious defence, but\n with a most scandalous confession of it. For though it was lawful for him, both by a\n decree of the senate, and also by the laws, to take corn and lay it up in the\n granaries, and though the senate had valued that corn at four sesterces for a modius of wheat, two\n for one of barley, Verres, having first added to the quantity of wheat, valued each\n modius of wheat with the cultivators at three\n denarii . My\n charge is not this, O Hortensius; do not you think about this; I know that many\n virtuous, and brave, and incorruptible men, have often valued, both with the\n cultivators of the soil and with cities, the corn which ought to have been taken and\n laid up in the granary, and have taken money instead of corn; I know what is\n accustomed to be done; I know what is lawful to be done; nothing which has been\n previously the custom of virtuous men is found fault with ill the conduct of Verres.\n \n ",
                "188":"\n This is what I find fault with, that, when a modius of wheat in Sicily cost\n two sesterces , as his letter which was sent to you\n declares, or at most, three, as has also already been made clear from all the\n evidence and all the accounts of the cultivators, he exacted from the cultivators\n three denarii for every modius of wheat. This is the charge; I wish you to understand, that my accusation\n turns not on the fact of his having valued the corn, nor even of his having valued\n it at three denarii but on that of his having\n increased the quantity of corn, and consequently the amount of the valuation. In\n truth this valuation originated, O judges, at first not in the convenience of the\n praetors or consuls, but in the advantage to the cultivators and the cities. For\n originally, no one was so impudent as to demand money when it was corn that was due;\n certainly this proceeded in the first instance from the cultivator or from the city\n which was required to furnish corn; when they had either sold the corn, or wished to\n keep it, or were not willing to carry it to that place where it was required to be\n delivered, they begged as a kindness and a favour, that they might be allowed,\n instead of the corn, to give the value of the corn. From such a commencement as\n this, and from the liberality and accommodating spirit of the magistrates the custom\n of valuations was introduced. \n ",
                "189":"\n More covetous, magistrates succeeded; who, in their avarice, devised not only a\n plan for their own gain, but also a way of escape, and a plea for their defence.\n They adopted a custom of always requiring corn to be delivered at the most remote\n and inconvenient places, in order that, through the difficulty of carriage, the\n cultivators might be more easily brought to the valuation which they wished. In a\n case of this kind it is easier to form one's opinion, than to make out a case for\n blame; because we can think the man who does this avaricious, but we cannot easily\n make out a charge against him; because it appears that we must grant this to our\n magistrates, that they may have power to receive the corn in any place they choose;\n therefore this is what many perhaps have done, not, however, so many out that those\n whom we recollect, or whom we have heard of as the most upright magistrates, have\n declined to do it. \n ",
                "190":"\n I ask of you now, O Hortensius, with which of these classes you are going to\n compare the conduct of Verres? With those, I suppose, who, influenced by their own\n kindness, have granted, as a favour and as a convenience to the cities, permission\n to give money instead of corn. And so I suppose the cultivators begged of him, that,\n as they could not sell a modius of wheat for three\n sesterces , they may be allowed to pay three\n denarii instead of each modius . Or, since you do not dare to say this, will you take refuge in\n that assertion, that, being influenced by the difficulty of carriage, they preferred\n to give three denarii ? Of what carriage? Wishing\n not to have to carry it from what place to what place? from Philomelium to Ephesus ? I see what is the difference between the price of corn at\n different places; I see too how many days' journey it is; I see that it is for the\n advantage of the Philomelians rather to pay in Phrygia the price which corn bears in Ephesus , than to carry it to Ephesus , or to send both money and agents to Ephesus to buy corn. \n ",
                "191":"\n But what can there be like that in Sicily ? Enna is a completely\n inland town. Compel (that is the utmost stretch of your authority) the people of\n Enna to deliver their corn at the\n waterside; they will take it to Phintia, or to Halesa, or to Catina , places all very distant from one another,\n the same day that you issue the order; though there is not even need of any carriage\n at all; for all this profit of the valuation, O judges, arises from the variety in\n the price of corn. For a magistrate in a province can manage this,—namely, to\n receive it where it is dearest. And therefore that is the way valuations are managed\n in Asia and in Spain , and in those provinces in which corn is not everywhere the\n same price. But in Sicily what difference\n did it make to any one in what place he delivered it? for he had not to carry it;\n and wherever he was ordered to carry it, there he might buy the same quantity of\n corn which he sold at home. \n ",
                "192":"\n Wherefore, if, O Hortensius, you wish to show that anything, in the matter of the\n valuation, was done by him like what has been done by others, you must show that at\n any place in Sicily , while Verres was\n praetor, a modius of wheat ever cost three denarii . See what a defence I have opened to you; how unjust to our allies,\n how far removed from the good of the republic, how utterly foreign to the intention\n and meaning of the law. Do you, when I am prepared to deliver you corn on my own\n farm, in my own city,—in the very place, in short, in which you are, in which you\n live, in which you manage all your business and conduct the affairs of the\n province,—do you, I say, select for me some remote and desert corner of the island?\n Do you bid me deliver it there, whither it is very inconvenient to carry it? where I\n cannot purchase it? \n ",

If in any\n place of that province corn was at the price at which he valued it, then I think\n that this charge ought not to have any weight against him. But when it was fetching\n two sesterces , or even three at the outside, in any\n district of the province which you choose to name, you exacted twelve. If there\n cannot be any dispute between you and me either about the price of corn, or about\n your valuation, why are you sitting there? What are you waiting for? What will you\n say in your defence? Does money appear to have been appropriated by you contrary to\n the laws, contrary to the interests of the republic, to the great injury of our\n allies?

If you wished to act as men\n desirous of gaining popularity, or as kind-hearted men would, as the senate had\n valued the corn at more than the regular price, you would have paid for it according\n to the valuation of the senate, and not according to the market price.

Will you retain that money which the senate intended\n should be paid to me, and take two sesterces \n a- modius from me, to whom you ought to pay a\n denarius for each modius ?

Is money also to be extorted from the cultivators? How? By what\n right? by what precedent?

Although those men have been drained and ruined\n by Verres in every possible manner, still you ought to decide what contribution you\n consider the cultivator ought to render to the republic on account of his land, and\n what charges he can support. You impose the payment of tenths on them. They endure\n that. A second tenth.

Although I pass over all\n this; I am speaking of the granary. Is it your intention that the Sicilians should\n give corn to our magistrates for their granaries for nothing? What can be more\n scandalous, what can be more iniquitous than that? And yet, know you that this would\n have seemed to the cultivators a thing to be wished for, to be begged for, while\n that man was praetor. \n Sositenus is a citizen of Entella; a man of the greatest prudence, and of the\n noblest birth in his city. You have heard what he said when he was sent by the\n public authority to this trial as a deputy, together with Artemon and Meniscus, men\n of the highest character. He, when in the senate at Entella he was discussing with\n me the injustice of Verres, said this: that, if the question of the granaries and of\n the valuation were conceded, the Sicilians were willing to promise the senate corn\n for the granary without payment, so that we need not for the future vote such large\n sums to our magistrates. \n ",
                "200":"\n I am sure that you clearly perceive how advantageous this would be for the\n Sicilians not because of the justice of such a condition, but in the way of choosing\n the least of two evils; for the man who had given Verres a thousand modii for the granary as his share of the contribution\n required, would have given two, or, at most, three thousand sesterces , but the same man has now been compelled for the same\n quantity of corn to give eight thousand sesterces .\n A cultivator could not stand this for three years, at least not out of his own\n produce. He must inevitably have sold his stock. But if the land can endure this\n contribution and this tribute,—that is to say, if Sicily can bear and support it, let it pay it to the Roman people\n rather than to our magistrates. It is a great sum, a great and splendid revenue. If\n you can obtain it without damage to the province, without injury to our allies, I do\n not object at all. Let as much be given to the magistrates for their granary as has\n always been given. What Verres demands besides, that, if they cannot provide it, let\n them refuse.

If it is just and endurable, then Sicily owes the Roman people tenths; let it give three denarii for each single modius of wheat; let it keep the corn itself. Money has been paid to\n you, O Verres,—one sum with which you were to buy corn for the granary, the other\n with which you were to buy corn from the cities to send to Rome . You keep at your own house the money which\n has been given to you; and besides that, you receive a vast sum in your own name. Do\n the same with respect to that corn which belongs to the Roman people; exact money\n from the cities according to the same valuation, and give back what you have\n received,—then the treasury of the Roman people will be better filled than it ever\n has been. \n ",

There are some things in you so\n extraordinary, that they cannot be said of, or meet in the character of, any other\n man; there are some things which you have in common with many men. Therefore, to say\n nothing of your acts of peculation, or of your taking money for the appointment of\n judges, and other things of that sort which, perhaps, other men also may have\n committed; will you defend yourself, also, from the charge which I bring against you\n as the most serious one of all—the charge, namely, of having taken money to\n influence your legal decisions, by the same argument, that others have done so too?\n Even if I were to admit the assertion, still I should not admit it as any defence.\n For it would be better that by your condemnation there should be more limited room\n for defending dishonesty left to others, than that, owing to your acquittal, others\n should be thought to have legitimately done what they have done with the greatest\n audacity. \n ",

The Roman people is now no longer able to bear (I have not to say the\n violence, the arms, and the war, but) the mourning, the tears, and the complaints,\n of all foreign nations. In a case of this sort, in speaking of customs of this sort,\n if he who is brought before the tribunal, when he is detected in evident crimes,\n says that others have also done the same, he will not want examples; but the\n republic will want safety, if, by the precedents of wicked men, wicked men are to be\n delivered from trial and from danger. \n ",

For when in a cause of\n such importance, when in the case of a charge of such gravity, the defendant has\n begun to say that anything has frequently been done, those who hear him are\n expecting precedents drawn from ancient tradition; from old records and old\n documents, full of dignity, full of antiquity. For such instances usually have both a great deal of\n authority in proving any point, and are very pleasant to hear cited. Will you speak\n to me of the Africani, and the Catos and the Laelii, and will you say that they have\n done the same thing? Then, even though the act might not please me, still I should\n not be able to fight against the authority of those men. But, since you will not be\n able to produce them, will you bring forward these moderns, Quintus Catulus the\n father, Caius Marcius, Quintus Scaevola, Marcus Scaurus, Quintus Metellus? who have\n all governed provinces, and who have all levied corn on the ground of filling the\n granary. The authority of the men is great, so great as to be able to remove all\n suspicion of wrong-doing. \n ",
                "209":"\n But you have not, even out of these men who have lived more recently, one\n precedent of that authority. Whither, then, or to what examples will you bring me\n back? Will you lead me away from those men who have spent their lives in the service\n of the republic at a time when manners were very strict, and when the opinion of men\n was considered of great weight, and when the courts of justice were severe, to the\n existing caprice and licentiousness of men of the present age? And do you seek\n precedents for your defence among those men, as a warning to whom the Roman people\n have decided that they are in need of some severe examples? I do not, indeed,\n altogether condemn the manners of the present time, as long as we follow those\n examples which the Roman people approves of; not those which it condemns. I will not\n look around me, I will not go out of doors to seek for any one, while we have as\n judges those chiefs of the city, Publius Servilius and Quintus Catulus, who are men\n of such authority, and distinguished for such exploits, that they may be classed in\n that number of ancient and most illustrious men of whom I have previously spoken.\n \n ",
                "210":"\n We are seeking examples, and those not ancient ones. Very lately each of them had\n an army. Ask, O Hortensius, since you are fond of modern instances, what they did.\n Will you not? Quintus Catulus used corn, but he exacted no money. Publius Servilius,\n though he commanded an army for five years, and by that means might have made an\n incalculable sum of money, thought that nothing was lawful for himself which he had\n not seen his father and his grandfather, Quintus Metellus, do. Shall Caius Verres be\n found, who will say that everything is lawful for him which is profitable? Will he\n allege in his defence that he has done in accordance with the example set by others,\n what none, except wicked men, ever have done? Oh, but it has been often done in\n Sicily . What is that condition in which Sicily is? Why is the law of injustice, especially\n defined by a reference to the usages prevalent in that land which, on account of its\n antiquity as our ally, its fidelity, and its nearness to us, ought to enjoy the best\n laws of all? \n ",
                "211":"\n However, in Sicily itself, (I will not go\n abroad to look for examples,) I will take examples out of the very bench of judges\n before me. Caius Marcellus, I call you as a witness. You governed the province of\n Sicily when you were proconsul. Under\n your command were any sums of money extorted, under the name of money for the\n granary? I do not give you any credit for this. There are other exploits, other\n designs of yours worthy of the highest praise, measures by which you recovered and\n set up again an afflicted and ruined province. For even Lepidus whom you succeeded\n had not committed this fraud about the granary. What precedents then have you in\n Sicily affecting this charge about the\n granary, if you cannot defend yourself from the accusation by quoting any action\n even of Lepidus, much less any action of Marcellus? \n ",
                "212":"\n Are you going to bring me back to the valuation of the corn, and the exaction of\n money by Marcus Antonius? Just so, says he; to the valuation of Marcus Antonius. For\n this is what he seemed to mean by his signs and nods. Out of all the praetors of the\n Roman people then, and consuls, and generals, have you selected Marcus Antonius, and\n even the most infamous action done by him, for your imitation? And here is it\n difficult for me to say, or for the judges to think, that in that unlimited\n authority Marcus Antonius behaved himself in such a manner, that it is by far more\n injurious to Verres to say that as he, in a most infamous transaction, wished to\n imitate Antonius, than if he were able to allege in his defence, that he had never\n in his whole life done anything like Marcus Antonius? Men in trials are accustomed\n to allege, in making a defence against an accusation, not what any one did, but what\n he did that was good. In the middle of his course of injustice and covetousness\n death overtook Antony, while he was still both doing and planning many things\n contrary to the safety of the allies many things contrary to the advantage of our\n provinces. Will you defend the audacity of Verres by the example of Antonius, as if\n the senate and people of Rome approved of\n all his actions and designs? \n ",
                "213":"\n But Sacerdos did the same. You name an upright man, and one endued with the\n greatest wisdom; but he can only be thought to have done the same thing, if he did\n it with the same intention. For the mere fact of the valuation has never been found\n fault with by me; but the equity of it depends on the advantage to, and willingness\n of the cultivator. No valuation can be found fault with, which is not only not\n disadvantageous, but which is even pleasing to the cultivator. Sacerdos, when he\n came into the province, commanded corn to be provided for the granary. As before the\n new harvest came in a modius of wheat was five\n denarii , the cities begged of him to have a\n valuation. The valuation wee somewhat lower than the actual market price, for he\n valued it at three denarii . You see that the same\n fact of a valuation, through the dissimilarity of the occasion, was a cause of\n praise in his instance, of accusation in yours. In his instance it was a kindness,\n in yours an injury. \n ",
                "214":"\n The same year Antonius valued corn at three denarii , after the harvest, in a season of exceeding cheapness, when\n the cultivators would rather give the corn for nothing, and he said that he had\n valued it at the same price as Sacerdos; and he spoke truly, but yet' by the same\n valuation the one had relieved the cultivators, the other had ruined them. And if it\n were not the case that the whole value of corn must be estimated by the season, and\n the market price, not by the abundance, nor by the total amount, these modii and a half of yours, O Hortensius, would never have\n been so agreeable; in distributing which to the Roman people, for every head, small\n as the quantity was, you did an action which was most agreeable to all men; for the\n dearness of corn caused that, which seemed a small thing in reality, to appear at\n that time a great one. If you had given such a largess to the Roman people in a time\n of cheapness, your kindness would have been derided and despised. \n ",
                "215":"\n Do not, therefore, say that Verres did the same as Sacerdos had done, since he did\n not do it on the same occasion, nor when wheat was at a similar price; say rather,\n since you have a competent authority to quote, that he did for three years what\n Antonius did on his arrival, and with reference to scarcely a month's provisions,\n and defend his innocence by the act and authority of Marcus Antonius. For what will\n you say of Sextus Peducaeus, a most brave and honest man? What cultivator ever\n complained of him? or who did not think that his praetorship was the most impartial\n and the most active one that has ever been known up to this time? He governed the\n province for two years, when one year wee a year of cheapness, the other a year of\n the greatest dearness. Did any cultivator either give him money in the cheap season,\n or in the dear season complain of the valuation of his corn? Oh, but provisions were\n very abundant that dear season. \n ",
                "216":"\n I believe they were; that is not a new thing nor a blamable one. We very lately\n saw Caius Sentius, a man of old-fashioned and extraordinary incorruptibility, on\n account of the dearness of food which existed in Macedonia , make a great deal of money by furnishing provisions. So\n that I do not grudge you your profits, if any have come to you legally; I complain\n of your injustice; I impeach your dishonesty; I cat your avarice into court, and\n arraign it before this tribunal. But if you wish to excite a\n suspicion that this charge belongs to more men and more provinces than one, I will\n not be afraid of that defence of yours, but I will profess myself the defender of\n all the provinces. In truth I say this, and I say it with a loud voice, “Wherever\n this has been done, it has been done wickedly; whoever has done it is deserving of\n punishment.” \n ",
                "217":"\n For, in the name of the immortal gods, see, O judges, look forward with your\n mind's eye at what will be the result. Many men have exacted large sums from\n unwilling cities, and from unwilling cultivators, in this way, under pretence of\n filling the granary. (I have no idea of any one person having done so except him,\n but I grant you this, and I admit that many have.) In the case of this man you see\n the matter brought before a court of justice; what can you do? can you, when you are\n judges in a case of embezzlement which is brought before you, overlook the\n misappropriation of so large a sum? or can you, though the law was made for the sake\n of the allies, turn a deaf ear to the complaints of the allies? \n ",
                "218":"\n However, I give up this point too to you. Disregard what is past, if you please;\n but do not destroy their hopes for the future, and ruin all the provinces; guard\n against this,—against opening, by your authority, a visible and broad way for\n avarice, which up to this time has been in the habit of advancing by secret and\n narrow paths; for if you approve of this, and if you decide that it is lawful for\n money to be taken on that pretext, at all events there is no one except the most\n foolish of men who will not for the future do what as yet no one except the most\n dishonest of men ever has done; they are dishonest men who exact money contrary to\n the laws, they are fools who omit to do what it has been decided that they may do.\n \n ",
                "219":"\n In the next place, see, O judges, what a boundless licence for plundering people\n of money you will he giving to men. If the man who exacts three denarii is acquitted, some one else will exact four, five,\n presently ten, or even twenty. What reproof will he meet with? At what degree of\n injury will the severity of the judge first begin to make a stand? How many denarii will it be that will be quite intolerable? and at\n what point will the iniquity and dishonesty of the valuation be first arraigned? For\n it is not the amount, but the description of valuation that will be approved of by\n you. Nor can you decide in this manner, that it is lawful for a valuation to be made\n when the price fixed is three denarii , but not\n lawful when the price fixed is ten; for when a departure is once made from the\n standard of the market price, and when the affair is once so changed that it is not\n the advantage of the cultivators which is the rule, but the will of the praetor,\n then the manner of valuing no longer depends on law and duty, but on the caprice and\n avarice of men. \n Wherefore, if in giving your decisions you once pass over the boundary of equity and\n law, know that you impose on those who come after no limit to dishonesty and avarice\n in valuing. \n ",
                "220":"\n See, therefore, how many things are required of you at once. Acquit the man who\n confesses that he has taken immense sums, doing at the same time the greatest injury\n to our allies. That is not enough. There are also many others who have done the same\n thing. Acquit them also, if there are any; so as to release as many rogues as\n possible by one decision. Even that is not enough. Cause that it may be lawful to\n those who come after them to do the same thing. It shall be lawful. Even this is too\n little. Allow it to be lawful for every one to value corn at whatever price he\n pleases. He may so value it. You see now, in truth, O judges, that if this valuation\n be approved of by you, there will be no limit hereafter to any man's avarice, nor\n any punishment for dishonesty. \n ",
                "221":"\n What, therefore, O Hortensius, are you about? You are the consul elect, you have\n had a province allotted to you. When you speak on the subject of the valuation of\n corn, we shall listen to you as if you were avowing that you will do what you defend\n as having been legitimately done by Verres; and as if you were very eager that that\n should be lawful for you which you say was lawful for him. But if that is to be\n lawful, there is nothing which you can imagine any one likely to do hereafter, in\n consequence of which he can possibly be condemned for extortion. For whatever sum of\n money any one covets, that amount it will be lawful for him to acquire, under the\n plea of the granary, and by means of the highness of the valuation. \n ",
                "222":"\n But there is a thing, which, even if Hortensius does not say it openly in\n defending Verres, he still does say in such a manner that you may suspect and think\n that this matter concerns the advantage of the senators; that it concerns the\n advantage of those who are judges, and who think that they will some day or other be\n in the provinces themselves as governors or as lieutenants. But you must think that\n we have splendid judges, if you think them likely to show indulgence to the faults\n of others, in order the more easily to be allowed to commit faults themselves. Do we\n then wish the Roman people, do we wish the provinces, and our allies, and foreign\n nations to think that, if senators are the judges, this particular manner of\n extorting immense sums of money with the greatest injustice will never be in any way\n chastised? But if that be the case, what can we say against that praetor who every\n day occupies the senate, who insists upon it that the republic can not prosper, if\n the office of judge is not restored to the equestrian order? \n ",
                "223":"\n But if he begins to agitate this one point, that there is one description of\n extortion, common to all the senators, and now almost legalized in the case of that\n order, by which immense sums are taken from the allies with the greatest injustice;\n and that this cannot possibly be repressed by tribunals of senators, but that, while\n the equestrian order furnished the senators, it never was committed; who, then, can\n resist him? Who will be so desirous of gratifying you, who will be such a partisan\n of your order, as to be able to oppose the transference of the appointment of judges\n to that body? And I wish\n he were able to make a defence to this charge by any argument, however false, as\n long as it is natural and customary. You could then decide with less danger to\n yourselves, with less danger to all the provinces. Did he deny that he had adopted\n this valuation? You would appear to have believed the man in that statement, not to\n have approved of his action. He cannot possibly deny it. It is proved by all\n Sicily . Out of all that numerous band of\n cultivators, there is not one from whom money has not been exacted on the plea of\n the granary. \n ",
                "224":"\n I wish he were able to say even this, that that affair does not concern him; that\n the whole business relating to corn was managed by the quaestors. Even that he\n cannot say, because his own letters are read which were sent to the cities, written\n on the subject of the three denarii . What then is\n his defence? “I have done what you accuse me of; I have extorted immense sums on the\n plea of the granary; but it was lawful for me to do so, and it will be lawful for\n you if you take care.” A dangerous thing for the provinces for any classes of injury\n to be established by judicial decision to a dangerous thing for our order, for the\n Roman people to think that these men, who themselves are subject to the laws, cannot\n defend the laws with strictness when they are judges. And while that man was\n praetor, O judges, there was not only no limit to his valuing corn, but there was\n none either to his demands of corn. Nor did he command that only to be supplied that\n was due, but as much as was advantageous for himself. I will put before you the sum\n total of all the corn commanded to be furnished for the granary, as collected out of\n the public documents, and the testimonies of the cities You will find, O judges,\n that man commanded the cities to supply five times as much as it was lawful for him\n to take for the granary. What can be added to this impudence, if he both valued it\n at such a price that men could not endure it, and also commanded so much more to be\n supplied than was permitted to him by the laws to require? \n ",
                "225":"\n Wherefore, now that you have heard the whole business of\n the corn, O judges, you can easily see that Sicily , that most productive and most desirable province, has been\n lost to the Roman people, unless you recover it by your condemnation of that man.\n For what is Sicily , if you take away the\n cultivation of its land, and if you extinguish the multitude and the very name of\n the cultivators of the soil? For what can there be left of disaster which has not\n come to those unhappy cultivators, with every circumstance of injury and insult?\n They were liable, indeed, to pay tenths, but they have scarcely had a tenth left for\n themselves. When money has been due to them, it has not been paid; though the senate\n intended them to supply corn for the granary according to a very equitable\n valuation, they have been compelled to sell even the tools with which they cultivate\n their lands. \n ",
                "226":"\n I have already said, O judges, that even if you remove all these injuries, still\n that the occupation of cultivating land is maintained owing to the hopes and a\n certain sort of pleasure which it gives, rather than because of the profit and\n emolument arising from it. In truth every year constant labour and constant expense\n is incurred in the hope of a result which is casual and uncertain. Moreover, the\n crop does not command a high price, except in a disastrous harvest. But if there has\n been a great abundance of crops gathered, then there is cheapness in selling them.\n So that you may see that the corn must be badly sold if it is got in well, or else\n that the crop must be bad if you get a good price for it. And the whole business of\n agriculture is such, that it is regulated not by reason or by industry, but by those\n most uncertain things,—the weather and the winds. When from agriculture one tenth is\n extracted by law and on fair terms,—when a second is levied by a new regulation, on\n account of the necessity of procuring a sufficient supply for ourselves,—when,\n besides, corn is purchased every year by public authority,—and when, after all that,\n more still is ordered by magistrates and lieutenants to be supplied for the\n granary,—what, or how much is there after all this of his own crop which the\n cultivator or owner can have at his own disposal, for his own profit? \n ",
                "227":"\n And if all this is endured,—if by their care, and expense, and labour, they\n consult your advantage and that of the Roman people rather than themselves and their\n own profit,—still, ought they also to bear these new edicts and commands of the\n praetors, and the imperiousness of Apronius, and the robberies and rapine of the\n slaves of Venus? Ought they also to supply corn which ought to be purchased of them\n without getting any payment for it? Ought they also, though they are willing to\n supply corn for the granary without payment, to be forced to pay large sums too?\n Ought they also to endure all these injures and all these losses accompanied with\n the greatest insult and contumely? Therefore, O judges, those things which they have\n not at all been able to bear, they have not borne. You know that over the whole of\n Sicily the allotments of land are\n deserted and abandoned by their owners. Nor is there anything else to be gained by\n this trial, except that our most ancient and faithful allies, the Sicilians, Roman\n settlers, and the cultivators of the soil, owing to your strictness and your care,\n may return to their farms and to their homes under my guidance and through my\n instrumentality. \n "

I will state the whole affair to you, and do you consider it according to\n its own importance and not by the importance of its name. First of all, O judges,\n suffer me to make you acquainted with the description of this conduct of his; and\n then, perhaps, you will not be very much puzzled to know by what name to call it. I\n say that in all Sicily , in all that wealthy\n and ancient province, that in that number of towns and families of such exceeding\n riches, there was no silver vessel, no Corinthian or Delian plate, no jewel or\n pearl, nothing made of gold or ivory, no statue of marble or brass or ivory, no\n picture whether painted or embroidered, that he did not seek out, that he did not\n inspect, that, if he liked it, he did not take away. \n ",

When I say that he left nothing whatever\n of the sort in the whole province, know that I am speaking according to the strict\n meaning of the words, and not in the spirit of an accuser. I will speak even more\n plainly; I will say that he has left nothing in any one's house, nothing even in the\n towns, nothing in public places, not even in the temples, nothing in the possession\n of any Sicilian, nothing in the possession of any Roman citizen; that he has left\n nothing, in short, which either came before his eyes or was suggested to his mind,\n whether private property or public, or profane or sacred, in all Sicily . \n ",

For by that\n means it will be the more easily seen how you behaved among those men who hate you,\n who accuse you, who will not let you rest, when you are proved to have plundered\n among the Mamertines, who are your friends, in the most infamous manner. Caius Heius is a Mamertine—all men\n will easily grant me this who have ever been to Messana ; the most accomplished man in every point of view in all that\n city. His house is the very best in all Messana ,—most thoroughly known, most constantly open, most especially\n hospitable to all our fellow-citizens. That house before the arrival of Verres was\n so splendidly adorned, as to be an ornament even to the city. For Messana itself, which is admirable on account of its\n situation, its fortifications, and its harbour, is very empty and bare of those\n things in which Verres delights. \n ",
                "3":"\n There was in the house of Heius a private chapel of great sacredness, handed down\n to him from his ancestors, very ancient; in which he had four very beautiful\n statues, made with the greatest skill, and of very high character; calculated not\n only to delight Verres, that clever and accomplished man, but even any one of us\n whom he calls the mob:—one, a statue of Cupid, in marble, a work of Praxiteles; for\n in truth, while I have been inquiring into that man's conduct, I have learnt the\n names of the workmen; it was the same workman, as I imagine, who made that\n celebrated Cupid of the same figure as this which is at Thespiae , on account of which people go to see Thespiae , for there is no other reason for going to\n see it; and therefore that great man Lucius Mummius, when he carried away from that\n town the statues of the Muses which are now before the temple of Good Fortune, and\n the other statues which were not consecrated, did not touch this marble Cupid,\n because it had been consecrated. \n ",
                "4":"\n But to return to that private chapel; there was this statue, which I am speaking\n of, of Cupid, made of marble. On the other side there was a Hercules, beautifully\n made of brass; that was said to be the work of Myron, as I believe, and it\n undoubtedly was so. Also before those gods there were little altars, which might\n indicate to any one the holiness of the chapel. There were besides two brazen\n statues, of no very great size, but of marvellous beauty, in the dress and robes of\n virgins, which with uplifted hands were supporting some sacred vessels which were\n placed on their heads, after the fashion of the Athenian virgins. They were called\n the Canephorae, but their maker was.... (who? who was he? thank you, you are quite\n right,) they called him Polycletus. Whenever any one of our citizens went to\n Messana , he used to go and see these\n statues. They were open every day for people to go to see them.

Oh! for the good faith of gods and men! What is the meaning of all\n this? What a cause is this? What impudence is this! The statues which I am speaking\n of, before they were taken away by you, no commander ever came to Messana without seeing So many praetors, so many\n consuls as there have been in Sicily , in\n time of peace, and in time of war; so many men of every sort as there have been—I do\n not speak of upright, innocent, conscientious men, but so many covetous, so many\n audacious, so many infamous men as there have been, not one of them all was violent\n enough, or seemed to himself powerful enough or noble enough, to venture to ask for,\n or to take away, or even to touch anything in that chapel. Shall Verres take away\n everything which is most beautiful everywhere? Shall it not be allowed to any one\n besides to have anything? Shall that one house of his contain so many wealthy\n houses? Was it for this reason that none of his predecessors ever touched these\n things, that he might be able to carry them off? Was this the reason why Caius\n Claudius Pulcher restored them, that Caius Verres might be able to steal them? But\n that Cupid had no wish for the house of a pimp and the establishment of a harlot; he\n was quite content to stay in that chapel where he was hereditary; he knew that he\n had been left to Heius by his ancestors, with the rest of the sacred things which he\n inherited; he did not require the heir of a prostitute. \n ",
                "7":"\n But why am I borne on so impetuously? I shall in a moment be refuted by one word.\n “I bought it,” says he. O ye immortal gods, what a splendid defence! we sent a\n broker into the province with military command and with the forces, to buy up all\n the statues, all the paintings, all the silver plate and gold plate, and ivory, and\n jewels, and to leave nothing to any body. For this defence seems to me to be got\n ready for everything; that he bought them. In the first place, if I should grant to\n you that which you wish, namely, that you bought them, since against all this class\n of accusations you are going to use this defence alone, I ask what sort of tribunals\n you thought that there would be at Rome ,\n if you thought that any one would grant you this, that you in your praetorship and\n in your command bought up so many and such\n valuable things,—everything, in short, which was of any value in the whole province.\n \n ",
                "8":"\n Remark the care of our ancestors, who as yet suspected no such conduct as this, but\n yet provided against the things which might happen in affairs of small importance.\n They thought that no one who had gone as governor or as lieutenant into a province\n would be so insane as to buy silver, for that was given him out of the public fends;\n or raiment, for that was afforded him by the laws; they thought he might buy a\n slave, a thing which we all use, and which is not provided by the laws. They made a\n law, therefore, “that no one should buy a slave except in the room of a slave who\n was dead.” If any slave had died at Rome ?\n No, if any one had died in the place where his master was. For they did not mean you\n to furnish your house in the province, but to be of use to the province in its\n necessities. \n ",
                "9":"\n What was the reason why they so carefully kept us from making purchases in the\n provinces? This was it, O judges, because they thought it a robbery, not a purchase,\n when the seller was not allowed to sell on his own terms. And they were aware that,\n in the provinces, if he who was there with the command and power of a governor wished to purchase what was in any\n one's possession, and was allowed to do so, it would come to pass that he would get\n whatever he chose, whether it was to be sold or not, at whatever price he pleased.\n Some one will say, “Do not deal with Verres in that manner; do not try and examine\n his actions by the standard of old-fashioned conscientiousness; allow him to have\n bought them without being punished for it, provided he bought them in a fair way,\n not through any arbitrary exercise of power, nor from any one against his will, or\n by violence.” I will so deal with him. If Heius had anything for sale, if he sold it\n for the price at which he valued it, I give up inquiring why you bought it. \n ",
                "10":"\n What then are we to do? Are we to use arguments in a case of this sort? We must\n ask, I suppose, whether Heius was in debt, whether he had an auction,—if he had,\n whether he was in such difficulties about money matters, whether he was oppressed by\n such want, by such necessity, as to strip his private chapel, to sell his paternal\n gods. But I see that the man had no auction; that he never sold anything except the\n produce of his land; that he not only had no debts, but that he had always abundance\n of ready money. Even if all these things were contrary to what I say they were,\n still I say that he would not have sold things which had been so many years in the\n household and chapel of his ancestors. “What will you say if he was persuaded by the\n greatness of the sum given him for them?” It is not probable that a man, rich as he\n was, honourable as he was, should have preferred money to his own religious feelings\n and to the memorials of his ancestors. \n ",
                "11":"\n “That may be, yet men are sometimes led away from their habits and principles by\n large sums of money.” Let us see, then, how great a sum this was which could turn\n Heius, a man of exceeding riches, by no means covetous, away from decency, from\n affection, and from religion. You ordered him, I suppose, to enter in his account\n books, “All these statues of Praxiteles, of Myron, of Polycletus, were sold to\n Verres for six thousand five hundred sesterces .”\n Read the extracts from his accounts— [The accounts of Heius are read.] I am\n delighted that the illustrious names of these workmen, whom those men extol to the\n skies, have fallen so low in the estimation of Verres—the Cupid of Praxiteles for\n sixteen hundred sesterces . From that forsooth has\n come the proverb “I had rather buy it than ask for it.” \n ",
                "12":"\n Some one will say, “What! do you value those things at a very high price?” But I am\n not valuing them according to any calculation of my own, or any need which I have\n for them; but I think that the matter ought to be looked at by you in this\n light,—what is the value of these things in the opinion of those men who are judges\n of these things; at what price they are accustomed to be sold; at what price these\n very things could be sold, if they were sold openly and freely; lastly, at what\n price Verres himself values them. For he would never have been so foolish, if he had\n thought that Cupid worth only four hundred denarii ,\n as to allow himself to be made a subject for the common conversation and general\n reproach of men. \n ",
                "13":"\n Who then of you all is ignorant at how great a price these things are valued? Have\n we not seen at an auction a brazen statue of no great size sold for a hundred and\n twenty thousand sesterces ? What if I were to choose\n to name men who have bought similar things for no less a price, or even for a higher\n one? Can I not do so? In truth, the only limit to the valuation of such things is\n the desire which any one has for them, for it is difficult to set bounds to the\n price unless you first set bounds to the wish. I see then that Heius was neither led\n by his inclination, nor by any temporary difficulties, nor by the greatness of the\n sum given, to sell these statues; and that you, under the presence of purchase which\n you put forward, in reality seized and took away these things by force, through\n fear, by your power and authority, from that man, whom, along with the rest of our\n allies in that country, the Roman people had entrusted not only to your power, but\n also to your upright exercise of it. \n ",
                "14":"\n What can there be, judges, so desirable for me in making this charge, as that Heius\n should say this same thing? Nothing certainly; but let us not wish for what is\n difficult to be obtained. Heius is a Mamertine. The state of the Mamertines alone,\n by a common resolution, praises that man in the name of the city. To all the rest of\n the Sicilians he is an object of hatred; by the Mamertines alone is he liked. But of\n that deputation which has been sent to utter his praises, Heius is the chief man; in\n truth, he is the chief man of his city, and too much occupied in discharging the\n public duties imposed upon him to speak of his private injuries. \n ",
                "15":"\n Though I was aware of and had given weight to these considerations, still, O\n judges, I trusted myself to Heius. I produced him at the first pleading; and indeed\n I did it without any danger, for what answer could Heius give even if he turned out\n a dishonest man, and unlike himself? Could he say that these statues were at his\n house, and not with Verres? How could he say anything of that sort? If he were the\n basest of men, and were inclined to lie most shamelessly, he would say this; that he\n had had them for sale, and that he had sold them at the price he wanted for them.\n The man the most noble in all his city, who was especially anxious that you should\n have a high opinion of his conscientiousness and of his worth, says first, that he\n spoke in Verres's praise by the public authority of his city, because that\n commission had been given to him; secondly; that he had not had these things for\n sale, and that, if he had been allowed to do what he wished, he could never have\n been induced by any terms to sell those things which were in his private chapel,\n having been left to him and handed down to him from his ancestors. \n ",
                "16":"\n Why are you sitting there, O Verres? What are you waiting for? Why do you say that\n you are hemmed in and overwhelmed by the cities of Centuripa, of Catina , of Halesa, of Tyndaris , of Enna , of Agyrium , and by all\n the other cities of Sicily ? Your second\n country, as you used to call it, Messana herself attacks you; your own Messana I say; the assistant in your crimes, the witness of your\n lusts, the receiver of your booty and your thefts. For the most honourable man of\n that city is present, a deputy sent from his home on account of this very trial, the\n chief actor in the panegyric on you; who praises you by the public order of his\n city, for so he has been charged and commanded to do. Although you recollect, O\n judges, what he answered when he was asked about the ship; that it had been built by\n public labour, at the public expense, and that a Mamertine senator had been\n appointed by the public authority to superintend its building. Heius in his private\n capacity flees to you for aid, O judges; he avails himself of this law, the common\n fortress of our allies, by which this tribunal is established. Although there is a\n law for recovering money which has been unjustly extorted, he says that he does not\n seem to recover any money; which though it has been taken from him, he does not so\n much care about: but he says he does demand back from you the sacred images\n belonging to his ancestors, he does demand back from you his hereditary household\n god? \n ",
                "17":"\n Have you any shame, O Verres? have you any religion? have you any fear, You have\n lived in Heius's house at Messana ; you saw\n him almost daily performing sacred rites in his private chapel before those gods. He\n is not influenced by money; he does not even ask to have those things restored which\n were merely ornaments. Keep the Canephorae; restore the images of the gods. And\n because he said this, because after a given time he, an ally and friend of the Roman\n people, addressed his complaints to you in a moderate tone, because he was very\n attentive to religious obligation not only while demanding back his paternal gods,\n but also in giving his evidence on oath; know that one of the deputies has been sent\n back to Messana , that very man who\n superintended the building of that ship at the public expense, to demand from the\n senate that Heius should be condemned to an ignominious punishment. \n ",
                "18":"\n O most insane of men, what did you think? that you should obtain what you\n requested? Did you not know how greatly he was esteemed by his fellow-citizens; how\n great his influence was considered? But suppose you had obtained your request;\n suppose that the Mamertines had passed any severe vote against Heius, what do you\n think would have been the authority of their panegyric, if they had decreed\n punishment to the man who it was notorious had given true evidence? Although, what\n sort of praise is that, when he who utters it, being questioned, is compelled to\n give answers injurious to him whom he is praising? What! are not those who are\n praising you, my witnesses? Heius is an encomiast of yours; he has done you the most\n serious injury. I will bring forward the rest; they will gladly be silent about all\n that they are allowed to suppress; they will say what they cannot help saying,\n unwillingly. Can they deny that a transport of the largest size was built for that\n man at Messana ? Let them deny it if they\n can. Can they deny that a Mamertine senator was appointed by the public authority to\n superintend the building of that ship? I wish they would deny it. There are other\n points also which I prefer reserving unmentioned at present, in order to give as\n little time as possible to them for planning and arranging their perjury. \n ",
                "19":"\n Let this praise, then, be placed to your account; let these men come to your relief\n with their authority, who neither ought to help you if they were able, nor could do\n so if they wished; on whom in their private capacity you have inflicted many\n injuries, and put many affronts, while in their city you have dishonoured many\n families for ever by your adulteries and crimes “But you have been of public service\n to their city.” Not without great injury to the republic and to the province of\n Sicily . They were bound to supply and\n they used to supply sixty thousand modii of wheat to\n the Roman people for payment; that was remitted by you of your own sole authority.\n The republic was injured because by your means its right of dominion over one city\n was disparaged; the Sicilians were injured, because this quantity was not deducted\n from the total amount of the corn to be provided by the island, but was only\n transferred to the cities of Centuripa and Halesa, whose inhabitants were exempt\n from that tax; and on them a greater burden was imposed than they were able to bear.\n \n ",
                "20":"\n It was your duty to require them to furnish a ship, in compliance with the treaty.\n You remitted it for three years. During all those years you never demanded one\n soldier. You acted as pirates are accustomed to act, who, though they are the common\n enemies of all men, still select some friends, whom they not only spare, but even\n enrich with their booty; and especially such as have a town in a convenient\n situation, where they often, and sometimes even necessarily, put in with their\n vessels. The town of\n Phaselis, which Publius Servilius took, had not been in former times a city of\n Cilicians and pirates. The Lycians, a Greek tribe, inhabited it; but because it was\n in such a situation as it was, and because it projected into the sea, so that\n pirates from Cilicia often necessarily\n touched at it when departing on an expedition, and were also often borne thither on\n their retreats, the pirates connected that city with themselves; at first by\n commercial intercourse, and afterwards by a regular alliance. \n ",
                "21":"\n The city of the Mamertines was not formerly of bad character; it was even a city\n hostile to dishonest men, and detained the luggage of Caius Cato, the one who was\n consul But then what sort of a man was he? a most eminent and most influential man;\n who however, though he had been consul, was convicted. So Caius Cato, the grandson\n of two most illustrious men, Lucius Paullus and Marcus Cato, and the son of the\n sister of Publius Africanus; who, even when convicted, at a time when severe\n judgments were in the habit of being passed, found the damages to which he was\n liable only estimated at eighteen thousand sesterces ; with this man, I say, the Mamertines were angry, who have\n often expended a greater sum than the damages in the action against Cato were laid\n at, in one banquet for Timarchides. \n ",
                "22":"\n But this city was the Phaselis for that robber and pirate of Sicily . Hither everything was brought from all\n quarters; with them it was left; whatever required to be concealed, they kept\n separate and stored away. By their agency he contrived everything which he wished\n put on board ship privately, and exported secretly; and in their harbour he\n contrived to have a vessel of the largest size built for him to send to Italy loaded with plunder. In return for these\n services, he gave them immunity from all expense, all labour, all military service,\n in short, from everything. For three years they were the only people, not only in\n Sicily , but, according to my opinion, in\n the whole world at such a time, who enjoyed excuse, relief, freedom, and immunity\n from every sort of expense, and trouble, and office. \n ",
                "23":"\n Hence arose that Verrean festival; hence it was that he ventured to order Sextus\n Cominius to be dragged before him at a banquet, at whom he attempted to throw a\n goblet, whom he ordered to be seized by the throat, and to be hurried from the\n banquet and thrown into a dark prison; hence came that cross, on which, in the sight\n of many men, he suspended a Roman citizen; that cross which he never ventured to\n erect anywhere except among that people, whom he had made sharers in all his crimes\n and robberies. Do you, O\n Mamertines, dare to come to praise any one? By what authority? by that which you\n ought to have with the Senatorial order? by that which you ought to have with the\n Roman people? \n ",
                "24":"\n Is there any city, not only in our provinces, but in the most distant nations,\n either so powerful, or so free, or so savage and uncivilized? is there any king, who\n would not invite a Senator of the Roman people to his house and to his home? An\n honour which is paid not only to the man, but in the first place to the Roman\n people, by whose indulgence we have risen to this order, and secondly to the\n authority of this order; and unless that is respected among our allies, where will\n be the name and dignity of the empire among foreign nations? The Mamertines did not\n give me any public invitation—when I say me, that is a trifle, but when they did not\n invite a Senator of the Roman people, they withheld an honour due not to the man but\n to his order. For to Tullius himself, the most splendid and magnificent house of\n Cnaeus Pompeius Basilicus was opened; with whom he would have lodged even if he had\n been invited by you. There was also the most honourable house of the Percennii, who\n are now also called Pompeius; where Lucius my brother lodged and was received by\n them with the greatest eagerness. A Senator of the Roman people, as far as depended\n on you as a body, lay in your town, and passed the night in the public streets. No\n other city ever did such a thing. “Yes,” say you, “for you were instituting a\n prosecution against our friend.” Will you put your own interpretation on what\n private business I have of my own, by diminishing the honour due to the Senate? \n ",
                "25":"\n But I will make my complaint of this conduct, if ever the time comes that there is\n any discussion concerning you among that body, which, up to this time, has been\n affronted by no one but you. With what face have you presented yourself before the\n eyes of the Roman people? when you have not yet pulled down that cross, which is\n even now stained with the blood of a Roman citizen, which is fixed up in your city\n by the harbour, and have not thrown it into the sea and purified all that place,\n before you came to Rome , and before this\n tribunal. On the territory of the Mamertines, connected with us by treaty, at peace\n with us, is that monument of your cruelty raised. Is not your city the only one\n where, when any one arrives at it from Italy , he sees the cross of a Roman citizen before he sees any friend\n of the Roman people? which you are in the habit of displaying to the people of\n Rhegium , whose city you envy, and to your\n inhabitants, Roman citizens as they are, to make them think less of themselves, and\n be less inclined to despise you, when they see the privileges of our citizenship\n extinguished by such a punishment. \n ",
                "26":"\n But you say you bought these things? What? did you forget to purchase of the same\n Heius that Attalic tapestry, celebrated over the whole of Sicily ? You might have bought them in the same way\n as you did the statues. For what did you do? Did you wish to spare the account\n books? This escaped the notice of that stupid man; he thought that what he stole\n from the wardrobe would be less notorious than what he had stolen from the private\n chapel. But how did he get it? I cannot relate it more plainly than Heius himself\n related it before you. When I asked, whether any other part of his property had come\n to Verres, he answered that he had sent him orders to send the tapestry to\n Agrigentum to him. I asked whether he had\n sent it. He replied as he must, that is, that he had been obedient to the praetor;\n that he had sent it.—I asked whether it had arrived at Agrigentum ; he said it had arrived.—I asked in what condition it had\n returned; he said it had not returned yet.—There was a laugh and a murmur from all\n the people. \n ",
                "27":"\n Did it never occur to you in this instance to order him to make an entry in his\n books, that he had sold you this tapestry too, for six thousand five hundred\n sesterces ? Did you fear that your debts would\n increase, if these things were to cost you six thousand five hundred sesterces , which you could easily sell for two hundred\n thousand? It was worth that, believe me. You would have been able to defend yourself\n if you had given that sum for it. No one would then have asked how much it was\n worth. If you could only prove that you had bought it, you could easily make your\n cause and your conduct appear reasonable to any one. But as it is, you have no way\n of getting out of your difficulty about the tapestry. What shall I say next? \n ",
                "28":"\n Did you take away by force some splendid harness, which is said to have belonged to\n King Hiero, from Philarchus of Centuripa, a wealthy and high-born man, or did you\n buy it of him? When I was in Sicily , this\n is what I heard from the Centuripans and from everybody else, for the case was very\n notorious; people said that you had taken away this harness from Philarchus of\n Centuripa, and other very beautiful harness from Aristus of Panormus , and a third set from Gratippus of\n Tyndarus. Indeed, if Philarchus had sold it to you, you would not, after the\n prosecution was instituted against you, have promised to restore it. But because you\n saw that many people knew of it, you thought that if you restored it to him, you\n would only have so much the less, but the original transaction would be proved\n against you nevertheless; and so you did not restore it. Philarchus said in his\n evidence, that when he became acquainted with this disease of yours, as your friends\n call it, he wished to conceal from you the knowledge of the existence of this\n harness; that when he was summoned by you, he said that he had not got any; and\n indeed, that he had removed them to another person's house, that they might not be\n found; but that your instinct was so great, that you saw them by the assistance of\n the very man in whose custody they were deposited; that then he could not deny that\n you had found him out, and so that the harness was taken from him against his will,\n and without any payment. \n ",
                "29":"\n Now, O judges, it is worth your while to know how he was accustomed to find and\n trace out all these things. There are two brothers, citizens of Cibyra , Tlepolemus and Hiero, one of whom, I\n believe, was accustomed to model in wax, the other was a painter. I fancy these men,\n as they had become suspected by their fellow-citizens of having plundered the temple\n of Apollo at Cibyra , fearing a trial and\n the punishment of the law, had fled from their homes. As they had known that Verres\n was a great connoisseur of such works as theirs, at the time that he, as you learnt\n from the witnesses, came to Cibyra with\n fictitious bills of exchange, they, when flying from their homes as exiles, came to\n him when he was in Asia . He has kept them\n with him ever since that time; and in the robberies he committed, and in the booty\n he acquired during his lieutenancy, he greatly availed himself of their assistance\n and their advice. \n ",

They were already\n well known to, and had been thoroughly tried by him, when he took them with him into\n Sicily . And when they arrived there, they\n scented cut and tracked everything in so marvellous a manner, (you might have\n thought they were bloodhounds,) that, wherever anything was they found it out by\n some means or other. Some things they found out by threatening, some by promising;\n this by means of slaves, that through freemen; one thing by a friend, another by an\n enemy. Whatever pleased them was sure to be lost. They whose plate was demanded had\n nothing else to hope, than that Tlepolemus and Hiero might not approve of it. \n ",
                "31":"\n I will relate to you this fact, O judges, most truly. I recollect that Pamphilus of\n Lilybaeum , a connection of mine by ties\n of hospitality, and a personal friend of mine, a man of the highest birth, told me,\n that when that man had taken from him, by his absolute power, an ewer made by the\n hand of Boethus, of exquisite workmanship and great weight, he went home very sad in\n truth, and greatly agitated, because a vessel of that sort, which had been left to\n him by his father and his forefathers, and which he was accustomed to use on days of\n festival, and on the arrival of ancient friends, had been taken from him. While I\n was sitting at home, said he, in great indignation, up comes one of the slaves of\n Venus; he orders me immediately to bring to the praetor some embossed goblets. I was\n greatly vexed, said he; I had two; I order them both to be taken out of the closet,\n lest any worse thing should happen, and to be brought after me to the praetor's\n house. When I got there the praetor was asleep; the Cibyratic brothers were walking\n about, and when they saw me, they said, Pamphilus, where are the cups? I show them\n with great grief;—they praise them.—I begin to complain that I shall have nothing\n left of any value at all, if my cups too were taken away. Then they, when they see\n me vexed, say, What are you willing to give us to prevent these from being taken\n from you? To make my story short, I said that I would give six hundred sesterces . Meantime the praetor summons us; he asks for\n the cups. Then they began to say to the praetor, that they had thought from what\n they had heard, that Pamphilus's cups were of some value, but that they were\n miserable things, quite unworthy of Verres's having them among his plate. He said,\n he thought so too. \n ",
                "32":"\n So Pamphilus saved his exquisite goblets. And indeed, before I heard this, though I\n knew that it was a very trifling sort of accomplishment to understand things of that\n sort, yet I used to wonder that he had any knowledge of them at all, as I knew that\n in nothing whatever had he any qualities like a man. But when I heard this, I then for the\n first time understood that that was the use of these two Cibyratic brothers; that in\n his robberies he used his own hands, but their eyes. But he was so covetous of that\n splendid reputation of being thought to be a judge of such matters, that lately,\n (just observe the man's madness,) after his case was adjourned, when he was already\n as good as condemned, and civilly dead, at the time of the games of the circus, when\n early in the morning the couches were spread in preparation for a banquet at the\n house of Lucius Sisenna, a man of the first consideration, and when the plate was\n all set out, and when, as was suited to the dignity of Lucius Sisenna, the house was\n full of honourable men, he came to the plate, and began in a leisurely way to\n examine and consider every separate piece. Some marveled at the folly of the man,\n who, while his trial was actually going on, was increasing the suspicion of that\n covetousness of which he was accused; others marveled at his insensibility, that any\n such things could come into his head, when the time for judgment in his cause was so\n near at hand, and when so many witnesses had spoken against him. But Sisenna's\n servants, who, I suppose, had heard the evidence which had been given against him,\n never took their eyes off him, and never departed out of reach of the plate. \n ",
                "33":"\n It is the part of a sagacious judge, from small circumstances to form his opinion\n of every man's covetousness or incontinence. And will any one believe that this man\n when praetor, was able to keep either his covetousness or his hands from the plate\n of the Sicilians, when, though a defendant, and a defendant within two days of\n judgment, a man in reality, and in the opinion of all men as good as already\n condemned, he could not in a large assembly restrain himself from handling and\n examining the plate of Lucius Sisenna? \n ",
                "34":"\n But that my discourse may return to Lilybaeum , from which I have made this digression, there is a man\n named Diocles, the son-in-law of Pamphilus, of that Pamphilus from whom the ewer was\n taken away, whose surname is Popillius. From this man he took away every article on\n his sideboard where his plate was set out. He may say, if he pleases, that he had\n bought them. In fact, in this case, by reason of the magnitude of the robbery, an\n entry of it, I imagine, has been made in the account-books. He ordered Timarchides\n to value the plate. How did he do it? At as low a price as any one ever valued any\n thing presented to an actor. Although I have been for some time acting foolishly in\n saying as much about your purchases, and in asking whether you bought the things,\n and how, and at what price you bought them, when I can settle all that by one word.\n Produce me a written list of what plate you acquired in the province of Sicily , from whom, and at what price you bought each\n article. \n ",
                "35":"\n What will you do? Though I ought not to ask you for these accounts, for I ought to\n have your account-books and to produce them. But you say that you never kept any\n accounts of your expenses in these years. Make me out at least this one which I am\n asking for, the account of the plate, and I will not mind the rest at present. “I\n have no writings of the sort; I cannot produce any accounts.” What then is to be\n done? What do you think that these judges can do? Your house was full of most\n beautiful statues already, before your praetorship; many were placed in your villas,\n many were deposited with your friends; many were given and presented to other\n people; yet you have no accounts speaking of any single one having been bought. All\n the plate in Sicily has been taken away.\n There is nothing left to any one that can be called his own. A scandalous defence is\n invented, that the praetor bought all that plate; and yet that cannot be proved by\n any accounts. If you do produce any accounts, still there is no entry in them how\n you have acquired what you have got. But of these years during which you say that\n you bought the greatest number of things, you produce no accounts at all. Must you\n not inevitably be, condemned, both by the accounts which you do, and by those which\n you do not produce? \n ",
                "36":"\n You also took away at Lilybaeum whatever\n silver vessels you chose from Marcus Caelius, a Roman knight, a most excellent young\n man. You did not hesitate to take away the whole furniture, of Caius Cacurius, a\n most active and accomplished man, and of the greatest influence in his city. You\n took away, with the knowledge of every body, a very large and very beautiful table\n of citron-wood from Quintus Lutatius Diodorus, who, owing to the kind exertion of\n his interest by Quintus Catulus, was made a Roman citizen by Lucius Sulla. I do not\n object to you that you stripped and plundered a most worthy imitator of yours in his\n whole character, Apollonius, the son of Nico, a citizen of Drepanum , who is now called Aulus Clodius, of all\n his exquisitely wrought silver plate;—I say nothing of that. For he does not think\n that any injury has been done to him, because you came to his assistance when he was\n a ruined man, with the rope round his neck, and shared with him the property\n belonging to their father, of which he had plundered his wards at Drepanum. I am\n even very glad if you took anything from him, and I say that nothing was ever better\n done by you. But it certainly was not right that the statue of Apollo should have\n been taken away from Lyso of Lilybaeum , I a\n most eminent man, with whom you had been staying as a guest. But you will say that\n you bought it—I know that—for six hundred sesterces . So I suppose: I know it, I say; I will produce the accounts;\n and yet that ought not to have been done. Will you say that the drinking vessels\n with emblems of Lilybaeum on them were,\n bought from Heius, the minor to whom Marcellus is guardian, whom you had plundered\n of a large sum of money, or will you confess that they were taken by force? \n ",
                "37":"\n But why do I enumerate all his ordinary iniquities in\n affairs of this sort, which appear to consist only in robberies committed by him,\n and in losses borne by those whom he plundered? Listen, if you please, O judges, to\n an action of such a sort as will prove to you clearly his extraordinary madness and\n frenzy, rather than any ordinary covetousness. \n There is a man of Melita , called Diodorus,\n who has already given evidence before you. He has been now living at Lilybaeum many years; a man of great nobility at\n home, and of great credit and popularity with the people among whom he has settled,\n on account of his virtue. It is reported to Verres of this man that he has some\n exceedingly fine specimens of chased work; and among them two goblets called\n Thericlean, made by the hand of mentor with the most\n exquisite skill. And when Verres heard of this, he was inflamed with such a desire,\n not only of beholding, but also of appropriating them, that he summoned Diodorus,\n and demanded them. He replied, as was natural for a man who took great pride in\n them, that he had not got them at Lilybaeum ; that he had left them at Melita , in the house of a relation of his. \n ",
                "38":"\n On this he immediately sends men on whom he can rely to Melita ; he writes to certain inhabitants of\n Melita to search out those vessels for\n him; he desires Diodorus to give them letters to that relation of his—the time\n appeared to him endless till he could see those pieces of plate. Diodorus, a prudent\n and careful man, who wished to keep his own property, writes to his relation to make\n answer to those men who came from Verres, that he had sent the cups to Lilybaeum a few days before. In the meantime he\n himself leaves the place. He preferred leaving his home, to staying in it and losing\n that exquisitely wrought silver work. But when Verres heard of this, he was so\n agitated that he seemed to every one to be raving, and to be beyond all question\n mad. Because he could not steal the plate himself, he said that he had been robbed\n by Diodorus of some exquisitely wrought vessels; he poured out threats against the\n absent Diodorus; he used to roar out before people; sometimes he could not restrain\n his tears. We have heard in the mythology of Eriphyla being so covetous that when\n she had seen a necklace, made, I suppose, of gold and jewels, she was so excited by\n its beauty, that she betrayed her husband for the sake of it. His covetousness was\n similar; but in one respect more violent and more senseless, because she was\n desiring a thing which she had seen, while his wishes were excited not only by his\n eyes, but even by his ears. \n ",
                "39":"\n He orders Diodorus to be sought for over the whole province. He had by this time\n struck his camp, packed up his baggage, and left Sicily . Verres, in order by some means or other to bring the man back\n to the province, devises this plan, if it is to be called a plan, and not rather a\n piece of madness. He sets up one of the men he calls his hounds, to say that he\n wishes to institute a prosecution against Diodorus of Melita for a capital offence. At first all men wondered at such a\n thing being imputed to Diodorus, a most quiet man, and as far removed as any man\n from all suspicion, not only of crime, but of even the slightest irregularity. But\n it soon became evident, that all this was done for the sake of his silver. Verres\n does not hesitate to order the prosecution to be instituted; and that, I imagine,\n was the first instance of his allowing an accusation to be made against an absent\n man. \n ",
                "40":"\n The matter was notorious over all Sicily ,\n that men were prosecuted for capital offences because the praetor coveted their\n chased silver plate; and that prosecutions were instituted against them not only\n when they were present, but even in their absence. Diodorus goes to Rome , and putting on mourning, calls on all his\n patrons and friends; relates the affair to every one. Earnest letters are written to\n Verres by his father, and by his friends, warning him to take care what he did, and\n what steps he took respecting Diodorus; that the matter was notorious and very\n unpopular; that he must be out of his senses; that this one charge would ruin him if\n he did not take care. At that time he considered his father, if not in the light of\n a parent, at least in that of a man. He had not yet sufficiently prepared himself\n for a trial; it was his first year in the province; he was not, as he was by the\n time of the affair of Sthenius, loaded with money. And so his frenzy was checked a\n little, not by shame, but by fear and alarm. He does not dare to condemn Diodorus;\n he takes his name out of the list of defendants while he is absent. In the meantime\n Diodorus, for nearly three years, as long as that man was praetor, was banished from\n the province and from his home. \n ",
                "41":"\n Every one else, not only Sicilians, but Roman citizens too, settled this in their\n minds, that, since he had carried his covetousness to such an extent, there was\n nothing which any one could expect to preserve or retain in his own possession if it\n was admired ever so little by Verres. But after they understood that that brave man, Quintus Arrius, whom\n the province was eagerly looking for, was not his successor, they then settled that\n they could keep nothing so carefully shut up or hidden away, as not to be most open\n and visible to his covetousness. After that, he took away from an honourable and\n highly esteemed Roman knight, named Cnaeus Salidius, whose son he knew to be a\n senator of the Roman people and a judge, some beautiful silver horses which had\n belonged to Quintus Maximus. I did not mean to say this, O judges, for he bought\n those, he did not steal them; \n ",
                "42":"\n I wish I had not mentioned them. Now he will boast, and have a fine ride on these\n horses. “I bought them, I have paid the money for them.” I have no doubt account\n books also will be produced. It is well worth while. Give me then the account-books.\n You are at liberty to get rid of this charge respecting Calidius, as long as I can\n get a sight of these accounts; still, if you had bought them, what ground had\n Calidius for complaining at Rome , that,\n though he had been living so many years in Sicily as a trader, you were the only person who had so despised and\n so insulted him, as to plunder him in common with all the rest of the Sicilians?\n what ground had he for declaring that he would demand his plate back again from you,\n if he had sold it to you of his own free will? Moreover, how could you avoid\n restoring it to Cnaeus Calidius; especially when he was such an intimate friend of\n Lucius Sisenna, your defender, and as you had restored their property to the other\n friends of Sisenna? \n ",
                "43":"\n Lastly, I do not suppose you will deny that by the intervention of Potamo, a friend\n of yours, you restored his plate to Lucius Cordius, an honourable man, but not more\n highly esteemed than Cnaeus Calidius; and it was he who made the cause of the rest\n more difficult to plead before you; for though you had promised many men to restore\n them their property, yet, after Cordius had stated in his evidence that you had\n restored him his, you desisted from making any more restorations, because you saw\n that you lost your plunder, and yet could not escape the evidence against you. Under\n all other praetors Cnaeus Calidius, a Roman knight, was allowed to have plate finely\n wrought; he was permitted to be able from his own stores to adorn and furnish a\n banquet handsomely, when he had invited a magistrate or any superior officer. Many\n men in power and authority have been with Cnaeus Calidius at his house; no one was\n ever found so mad as to take from him that admirable and splendid plate; no one was\n found bold enough to ask for it; no one impudent enough to beg him to sell it. \n ",
                "44":"\n For it is an arrogant thing, an intolerable thing, O judges, for a praetor to say\n to an honourable, and rich, and well-appointed man in his province, “Sell me those\n chased goblets.” For it is saying, “You do not deserve to have things which are so\n beautifully made; they are better suited to a man of my stamp.” Are you, O Verres,\n more worthy than Calidius? whom (not to compare your way of life with his, for they\n are not to be compared, but) I will compare you with in respect of this very dignity\n owing to which you make yourself out his superior. You gave eighty thousand sesterces to canvassing agents to procure your election as\n praetor; you gave three hundred thousand to an accuser not to press hardly upon you:\n do you, on that account, look down upon and despise the equestrian order? Is it on\n that account that it seemed to you a scandalous thing that Calidius should have\n anything that you admired rather than that you should? \n ",
                "45":"\n He has been long boasting of this transaction with Calidius, and telling every one\n that he bought the things. Did you also buy that censer of Lucius Papilius, a man of\n the highest reputation, wealth, and honour, and a Roman knight? who stated in his\n evidence that, when you had begged for it to look at, you returned it with the\n emblems torn off; so that you may understand that it is all taste in that man, not\n avarice; that it is the fine work that he covets, not the silver. Nor was this\n abstinence exercised only in the case of Papirius; he practiced exactly the same\n conduct with respect to every censer in Sicily ; and it is quite incredible how many beautifully wrought\n censers there were. I imagine that, when Sicily was at the height of its power and opulence, there were\n extensive workshops in that island; for before that man went thither as praetor\n there was no house tolerably rich, in which there were not these things, even if\n there was no other silver plate besides; namely, a large dish with figures and\n images of the gods embossed on it, a goblet which the women used for sacred\n purposes, and a censer. And all these were antique, and executed with the most\n admirable skill, so that one may suspect everything else in Sicily was on a similar scale of magnificence; but\n that though fortune had deprived them of much, those things were still preserved\n among them which were retained for purposes of religion. \n ",
                "46":"\n I said just now, O judges, that there were many censers, in almost every house in\n fact; I assert also, that now there is not even one left. What is the meaning of\n this? what monster, what prodigy did we send into the province? Does it not appear\n to you that he desired, when he returned to Rome , to satisfy not the covetousness of one man, not his own eyes\n only, but the insane passion of every covetous man, for as soon as he ever came into\n any city, immediately the Cibyratic hounds of his were slipped, to search and find\n cut everything. If they found any large vessel, any considerable work, they brought\n it to him with joy; if they could hunt out any smaller vessel of the same sort, they\n looked on those as a sort of lesser game, whether they were dishes, cups, censers,\n or anything else. What weepings of women, what lamentations do you suppose took\n place over these things? things which may perhaps seem insignificant to you, but\n which excite great and bitter indignation, especially among women, who grieve when\n those things are torn from their hands which they have been accustomed to use in\n religious ceremonies, which they have received from their ancestors, and which have\n always been in their family. \n ",
                "47":"\n Do not now wait while I follow up this charge from door to door, and show you that\n he stole a goblet from Aeschylus, the Tyndaritan; a dish from another citizen of\n Tyndaris named Thraso; a censer from\n Nymphodorus of Agrigentum . When I produce\n my witnesses from Sicily he may select whom\n he pleases for me to examine about dishes, goblets, and censers. Not only no town,\n no single house that is tolerably well off will be found to have been free from the\n injurious treatment of this man; who, even if he had come to a banquet, if he saw\n any finely wrought plate, could not, O judges, keep his hands from it. There is a\n man named Cnaeus Pompeius Philo, who was a native of Tyndaris ; he gave Verres a supper at his visa\n in the country near Tyndaris ; he did\n what Sicilians did not dare to do, but what, because he was a citizen of Rome , he thought he could do with impunity, he put\n before him a dish on which were some exceedingly beautiful figures. Verres, the\n moment he saw it, determined to rob his host's table of that memorial of the Penates\n and of the gods of hospitality. But yet, in accordance with what I have said before\n of his great moderation, he restored the rest of the silver after he had torn off\n the figures; so free was he from all avarice! \n ",
                "48":"\n What want you more? Did he not do the same thing to Eupolemus of Calacta, a noble\n man, connected with, and an intimate friend of the Luculli; a man who is now serving\n in the army under Lucius Lucullus? He was supping with him; the rest of the silver\n which he had set before him had no ornament on it, lest he himself should also be\n left without any ornament; but there were also two goblets, of no large size, but\n with figures on them. He, as if he had been a professional diner-out, who was not to\n go away without a present, on the spot, in the sight of all the other guests, tore\n off the figures. I do not attempt to enumerate all his exploits of this sort; it is\n neither necessary nor possible. I only produce to you tokens and samples of each\n description of his varied and universal rascality. Nor did he behave in these\n affairs as if he would some day or other be called to account for them, but\n altogether as if he was either never likely to be prosecuted, or else as if the more\n he stole, the less would be his danger when he was brought before the court;\n inasmuch as he did these things which I am speaking of not secretly, not by the\n instrumentality of friends or agents, but openly, from his high position, by his own\n power and authority. \n ",
                "49":"\n When he had come to Catina , a wealthy,\n honourable, influential city, he ordered Dionysiarchus the proagorus, that is to\n say, the chief magistrate, to be summoned before him; he openly orders him to take\n care that all the silver plate which was in anybody's house at Catina , was collected together and brought to him.\n Did you not hear Philarchus of Centuripa, a man of the highest position as to noble\n birth, and virtue, and riches, say the same thing on his oath; namely, that Verres\n had charged and commanded him to collect together, and order to be conveyed to him,\n all the silver plate at Centuripa, by far the largest and wealthiest city in all\n Sicily ? In the same manner at Agyrium , all the Corinthian vessels there were\n there, in accordance with his command, were transported to Syracuse by the agency of Apollodorus, whom you\n have heard as a witness. \n ",
                "50":"\n But the most extraordinary conduct of all was this; when that painstaking and\n industrious praetor had arrived at Haluntium, he would not himself go up into the\n town, because the ascent was steep and difficult; but he ordered Archagathus of\n Haluntium, one of the noblest men, not merely in his own city, but in all Sicily , to be summoned before him, and gave him a\n chance to take care that all the chased silver that there was at Haluntium, and\n every specimen of Corinthian work too, should be at once taken down from the town to\n the seaside. Archagathus went up into the town. That noble man, as one who wished to\n be loved and esteemed by his fellow citizens, was very indignant at having such an\n office imposed upon him, and did not know what to do. He announces the commands he\n has received. He orders every one to produce what they had. There was great\n consternation, for the tyrant himself had not gone away to any distance; lying on a\n litter by the sea-side below the town, he was waiting for Archagathus and the silver\n plate. What a gathering of people do you suppose took place in the sown? what an\n uproar? what weeping of women? they who saw it would have said that the Trojan horse\n had been introduced, and that the city was taken. \n ",
                "51":"\n Vessels were brought out without their cases; others were wrenched out of the hands\n of women; many people's doors were broken open, and their locks forced. For what\n else can you suppose? Even if ever, at a time of war and tumult, arms are demanded\n of private citizens, still men give them unwillingly, though they know that they are\n giving them for the common safety. Do not suppose then that any one produced his\n carved plate out of his house for another man to steal, without the greatest\n distress. Everything is brought down to the shore. The Cibyratic brothers are\n summoned; they condemn some articles; whatever they approve of has its figures in\n relief or its embossed emblems torn off. And so the Haluntines, having had all their\n ornaments wrenched off, returned home with the plain silver. \n ",
                "52":"\n Was there ever, O judges, a dragnet of such a sort as this in that province? People\n have sometimes during their year of office diverted some part of the public property\n to their own use, in the most secret manner; sometimes they even secretly plundered\n some private citizen of something; and still they were condemned. And if you ask me,\n though I am detracting somewhat from my own credit by saying so, I think those were\n the real accusers, who traced the robberies of such men as this by scent, or by some\n lightly imprinted footsteps; for what is it that we are doing in respect of Verres,\n who has wallowed in the mud till we can find him out by the traces of his whole\n body? Is it a great undertaking to say anything against a man, who while he was\n passing by a place, having his litter put down to rest for a little time, plundered\n a whole city, house by house; without condescending to any pretences, openly, by his\n own authority, and by an absolute command? But still, that he might be able to say\n that he had bought them, he orders Archagathus to give those men, to whom the plate\n had belonged, some little money, just for form's sake. Archagathus found a few who\n would accept the money, and those he paid. And still Verres never paid Archagathus\n that money. Archagathus intended to claim it at Rome ; but Cnaeus Lentulus Marcellinus demanded him, as you heard him\n state himself. Read the evidence of Archagathus, and of Lentulus,— \n ",
                "53":"\n and that you may not imagine that the man wished to heap up such a mass of figures\n without any reason, just see at what rate he valued you, and the opinion of the\n Roman people, and the laws, and the courts of justice, and the Sicilian witnesses\n and traders. After he had collected such a vast number of figures that he had not\n left one single figure to anybody, he established an immense shop in the palace at\n Syracuse ; he openly orders all the\n manufacturers, and carvers, and goldsmiths to be summoned—and he himself had many in\n his own employ; he collects a great multitude of men; he kept them employed\n uninterruptedly for eight months, though all that time no vessels were made of\n anything but gold. In that time he had so skillfully wrought the figures which he\n had torn off the goblets and censers, into golden goblets, or had so ingeniously\n joined them into golden cups, that you would say that they had been made for that\n very purpose; and he, the praetor, who says that it was owing to his vigilance that\n peace was maintained in Sicily , was\n accustomed to sit in his tunic and dark cloak the greater part of the day in this\n workshop. \n ",
                "54":"\n I would not venture, O judges, to mention these things, if I were not afraid that\n you might perhaps say that you had heard more about that man from others in common\n conversation, than you had heard from me in this trial; for who is there who has not\n heard of this workshop, of the golden vessels, of Verres's tunic and dark cloak?\n Name any respectable man you please out of the whole body of settlers at Syracuse , I will produce ham; there will not be\n one person who will not say that he has either seen this or heard of it. \n ",
                "55":"\n Alas for the age! alas for the degeneracy of our manners! I will not mention\n anything of any great antiquity; there are many of you, O judges, who knew Lucius\n Piso, the father of this Lucius Piso, who was praetor. When he was praetor in\n Spain , in which province he was slain,\n somehow or other, while he was practicing his exercises in arms, the golden ring\n which he had was broken and crushed. As he wanted to get himself another ring, he\n ordered a goldsmith to be summoned into the forum before his throne of office, at\n Corduba , and openly weighed him out the\n gold. He ordered the man to set up his bench in the forum, and to make him a ring in\n the presence of every one. Perhaps in truth some may say that he was too exact, and\n to this extent any one who chooses may blame him, but no further. Still such conduct\n was allowable for him, for he was the son of Lucius Piso, of that man who first made\n the law about extortion and embezzlement. \n ",
                "56":"\n It is quite ridiculous for me to speak of Verres now, when I have just been\n speaking of Piso the Thrifty; still, see what a difference there is between the men:\n that man, while he was making some sideboards full of golden vessels, did not care\n what his reputation was, not only in Sicily , but also at Rome in\n the court of justice; the other wished all Spain to know to half an ounce how much gold it took to make a\n praetor's ring. Forsooth, as the one proved his right to his name, so did the other\n to his surname. It is\n utterly impossible for me either to retain in my memory, or to embrace in my speech,\n all his exploits. I wish just to touch briefly on the different kinds of deeds, done\n by him, just as here the ring of Piso reminded me of what had otherwise entirely\n escaped my recollection. From how many honourable men do you imagine that that man\n tore the golden rings from off their fingers? He never hesitated to do so whenever\n he was pleased with either the jewels or the fashion of the ring belonging to any\n one. I am going to mention an incredible fact, but still one so notorious that I do\n not think that he himself will deny it. \n ",
                "57":"\n When a letter had been brought to Valentius his interpreter from Agrigentum , by chance Verres himself noticed the\n impression on the seal; he was pleased with it, he asked where the letter came from;\n he was told, from Agrigentum . He sent\n letters to the men with whom he was accustomed to communicate, ordering that ring to\n be brought to him as soon as possible. And accordingly, in compliance with his\n letter, it was torn off the finger of a master of a family, a certain Lucius Titius,\n a Roman citizen. But that covetousness of his is quite beyond belief. For as he\n wished to provide three hundred couches beautifully covered, with all other\n decorations for a banquet, for the different rooms which he has, not only at\n Rome , but in his different villas, he\n collected such a number, that there was no wealthy house in all Sicily where he did not set up an embroiderer's shop.\n \n ",
                "58":"\n There is a woman, a citizen of Segesta, very rich, and\n nobly born, by name Lamia . She, having\n her house full of spinning jennies, for three years was making him robes and\n coverlets, all dyed with purple; Attalus, a rich man at Netum ; Lyso at Lilybaeum ; Critolaus at Enna ; at Syracuse Aeschrio, Cleomenes, and Theomnastus; at Elorum Archonides and\n Megistus. My voice will fail me before the names of the men whom he employed in this\n way will; he himself supplied the purple—his friends supplied only the work, I dare\n say; for I have no wish to accuse him in every particular, as if it were not enough\n for me, with a view to accuse him, that he should have had so much to give, that he\n should have wished to carry away so many things; and, besides all that, this thing\n which he admits, namely, that he should have employed the work of his friends in\n affairs of this sort. \n ",
                "59":"\n But now do you suppose that brazen couches and brazen candelabra were made at\n Syracuse for any one but for him the whole of that three years? He bought them, I\n suppose; but I am informing you so fully, O judges, of what that man did in his\n province as praetor, that he may not by chance appear to any one to have been\n careless, and not to have provided and adorned himself sufficiently when he had\n absolute power. I come\n now, not to a theft, not to avarice, not to covetousness, but to an action of that\n sort that every kind of wickedness seems to be contained in it, and to be in it; by\n which the immortal gods were insulted, the reputation and authority of the name of\n the Roman people was impaired, hospitality was betrayed and plundered, all the kings\n who were most friendly to us, and the nations which are under their rule and\n dominion, were alienated from us by his wickedness. \n ",

When they, being\n hindered by the critical state of the republic at that time, were not able to obtain\n the discussion of the subject as they wished before the senate, they departed for\n Syria , their paternal kingdom. One of\n them—the one whose name is Antiochus—wished to make his journey through Sicily . And so, while Verres was praetor, he came to\n Syracuse . \n ",
                "61":"\n On this Verres thought that an inheritance had come to him, because a man whom he\n had heard, and on other accounts suspected had many splendid things with him, had\n come into his kingdom and into his power. He sends him presents—liberal enough—for\n all domestic uses; as much wine and oil as he thought fit; and as much wheat as he\n could want, out of his tenths. After that he invites the king himself to supper. He\n decorates a couch abundantly and magnificently. He sets out the numerous, and\n beautiful silver vessels, in which he was so rich; for he had not yet made all those\n golden ones. He takes care that the banquet shall be splendidly appointed and\n provided in every particular. Why need I make a long story of it? The king departed\n thinking that Verres was superbly provided with everything, and that he himself had\n been magnificently treated. After that, he himself invites the praetor to supper. He\n displays all his treasures; much silver, also not a few goblets of gold, which, as\n is the custom of kings, and especially in Syria , were studded all over with most splendid jewels. There was\n also a vessel for wine, a ladle hollowed out of one single large precious stone,\n with a golden handle, concerning which, I think, you heard Quintus Minutius speak, a\n sufficiently capable judge, and sufficiently credible witness. \n ",
                "62":"\n Verres took each separate piece of plate into his hands, praised it—admired it. The\n king was delighted that that banquet was tolerably pleasant and agreeable to a\n praetor of the Roman people. After the banquet was over, Verres thought of nothing\n else, as the facts themselves showed, than how he might plunder and strip the king\n of everything before he departed from the province. He sends to ask for the most\n exquisite of the vessels which he had seen at Antiochus's lodgings. He said that he\n wished to show them to his engravers. The king, who did not know the man, most\n willingly sent them, without any suspicion of his intention. He sends also to borrow\n the jeweled ladle. He said that he wished to examine it more attentively; that also\n is sent to him. \n ",
                "63":"\n Now, O judges, mark what followed; things which you have already heard, and which\n the Roman people will not hear now for the first time, and which have been reported\n abroad among foreign nations to the furthest corners of the earth. The kings, whom I\n have spoken of, had brought to Rome a\n candelabrum of the finest jewels, made with most extraordinary skill, in order to\n place it in the Capitol; but as they found that temple not yet finished, they could\n not place it there. Nor were they willing to display it and produce it in common, in\n order that it might seem more splendid when it was placed at its proper time in the\n shrine of the great and good Jupiter ; and\n brighter; also, as its beauty would come fresh and untarnished before the eyes of\n men. They determined, therefore, to take it back with them into Syria , with the intention, when they should hear\n that the image of the great and good\n Jupiter was dedicated, of sending ambassadors\n who should bring that exquisite and most beautiful present, with other offerings, to\n the Capitol. \n ",
                "64":"\n The matter, I know not how, got to his ears. For the king had wished it kept\n entirely concealed; not because he feared or suspected anything, but because he did\n not wish many to feast their eyes on it before the Roman people. He begs the king,\n and entreats him most earnestly to send it to him; he says that he longs to look at\n it himself, and that he will not allow any one else to see it. Antiochus, being both\n of a childlike and royal disposition, suspected nothing of that man's dishonesty,\n and orders his servants to take it as secretly as possible, and well wrapped up, to\n the praetor's house. And when they brought it there, and placed it on a table,\n having taken off the coverings, Verres began to exclaim that it was a thing worthy\n of the kingdom of Syria , worthy of being a\n royal present, worthy of the Capitol. In truth, it was of such splendour as a thing\n must be which is made of the most brilliant and beautiful jewels; of such variety of\n pattern that the skill of the workmanship seemed to vie with the richness of the\n materials; and of such a size that it might easily be seen that it had been made not\n for the furniture of men, but for the decoration of a most noble temple. And when he\n appeared to have examined it sufficiently, the servants begin to take it up to carry\n it back again. He says that he wishes to examine it over and over again; that he is\n not half satiated with the sight of it; he orders them to depart and to leave the\n candelabrum. So they then return to Antiochus empty-handed. \n ",
                "65":"\n The king at first feared nothing, suspected nothing. One day passed—two days—many\n days. It was not brought back. Then the king sends to Verres to beg him to return\n it, if he will be so good. He bids the slaves come again. The king begins to think\n it strange. He sends a second time. It is not returned. He himself calls on the man;\n he begs him to restore it to him. Think of the face and marvellous impudence of the\n man. That thing which he knew, and which he had heard from the king himself was to\n be placed in the Capitol, which he knew was being kept for the great and good\n Jupiter , and for the Roman people, that\n he began to ask and entreat earnestly to have given to him. When the king said that\n he was prevented from complying by the reverence due to Jupiter Capitolinus, and by\n his regard for the opinion of men, because many nations were witnesses to the fact\n of the candelabrum having been made for a present to the god, the fellow began to\n threaten him most violently. When he sees that he is no more influenced by threats\n than he had been by prayers, on a sadden he orders him to leave his province before\n night. He says, that he has found out that pirates from his kingdom were coming\n against Sicily . \n ",
                "66":"\n The king, in the most frequented place in Syracuse , in the forum,—in the forum at Syracuse , I say, (that no man may suppose I am\n bringing forward a charge about which there is any obscurity, or imagining anything\n which rests on mere suspicion,) weeping, and calling gods and men to witness, began\n to cry out that Caius Verres had taken from him a candelabrum made of jewels, which\n he was about to send to the Capitol, and which he wished to be in that most splendid\n temple as a memorial to the Roman people of his alliance with and friendship for\n them. He said that he did not care about the other works made of gold and jewels\n belonging to him which were in Verres's hands, but that it was a miserable and\n scandalous thing for this to be taken from him. And that, although it had long ago\n been consecrated in the minds and intentions of himself and his brother, still, that\n he then, before that assembled body of Roman citizens, offered, and gave, and\n dedicated, and consecrated it to the great and good\n Jupiter , and that he invoked\n Jupiter himself as a witness of his\n intention and of his piety. What voice, what lungs, what power of mine can adequately express the indignation\n due to this atrocity? The King Antiochus, who had lived for two years at Rome in the sight of all of us, with an almost royal\n retinue and establishment,—though he had been the friend and ally of the Roman\n people; though his father, and his grandfather, and his ancestors, most ancient and\n honourable sovereigns, had been our firmest friends; though he himself is monarch of\n a most opulent and extensive kingdom, is turned headlong out of a province of the\n Roman people. \n ",
                "67":"\n How do you suppose that foreign nations will take this? How do you suppose the news\n of this exploit of yours will be received in the dominions of other kings, and in\n the most distant countries of the world, when they hear that a king has been\n insulted by a praetor of the Roman people in his province? that a guest of the Roman\n people has been plundered? a friend and ally of the Roman people insultingly driven\n out? Know that your name and that of the Roman people will be an object of hatred\n and detestation to foreign nations. If this unheard-of insolence of Verres is to\n pass unpunished, all men will think, especially as the reputation of our men for\n avarice and covetousness has been very extensively spread, that this is not his\n crime only, but that of those who have approved of it. Many kings, many free cities,\n many opulent and powerful private men, cherish intentions of ornamenting the Capitol\n in such a way as the dignity of the temple and the reputation of our empire\n requires. And if they understand that you show a proper indignation at this kingly\n present being intercepted, they will then think that their zeal and their presents\n will be acceptable to you and to the Roman people. But if they hear that you have\n been indifferent to the complaint of so great a king, in so remarkable a case, in\n one of such bitter injustice, they will not be so crazy as to spend their time, and\n labour, and expense on things which they do not think will be acceptable to you.",
                "68":"And in this place I appeal to you, O Quintus\n Catulus; for I\n am speaking of your most honourable and most splendid monument. You ought to take\n upon yourself not only the severity of a judge with respect to this crime, but\n something like the vehemence of an enemy and an accuser. For, through the kindness\n of the senate and people of Rome , your\n honour is connected with that temple. Your name is consecrated at the same time as\n that temple in the everlasting recollection of men. It is by you that this case is\n to be encountered; by you, that this labour is to be undergone, in order that the\n Capitol, as it has been restored more magnificently, may also be adorned more\n splendidly than it was originally; that then that fire may seem to have been sent\n from heaven, not to destroy the temple of the great and good\n Jupiter , but to demand one for him more\n noble and more magnificent. \n ",
                "69":"\n You have heard Quintus Minucius Rufus say, that King Antiochus stayed at his house\n while at Syracuse ; that he knew that\n this candelabrum had been taken to Verres's house; that he knew that it had not been\n returned. You heard, and you shall hear from the whole body of Roman settlers at\n Syracuse , that they will state to\n you that in their hearing it was dedicated and consecrated to the good and great\n Jupiter by King Antiochus. If you were\n not a judge, and this affair were reported to you, it would be your especial duty to\n follow it up; to reclaim the candelabrum, and to prosecute this cause. So that I do\n not doubt what ought to be your feelings as judge in this prosecution, when before\n any one else as judge you ought to be a much more vehement advocate and accuser than\n I am. \n ",
                "70":"\n And to you, O judges, what can appear more scandalous or more intolerable than\n this? Shall Verres have at his own house a candelabrum, made of jewels and gold,\n belonging to the great and good Jupiter ?\n Shall that ornament be set out in his house at banquets which will be one scene of\n adultery and debauchery, with the brilliancy of which the temple of the great and\n good Jupiter ought to glow and to be lighted\n up? Shall the decorations of the Capitol be placed in the house of that most\n infamous debauchee with the other ornaments which he has inherited from Chelidon?\n What do you suppose will ever be considered sacred or holy by him, when he does not\n now think himself liable to punishment for such enormous wickedness? who dares to\n come into this court of justice, where he cannot, like all others who are arraigned,\n pray to the great and good Jupiter , and\n entreat help from him? from whom even the immortal gods are reclaiming their\n property, before that tribunal which was appointed for the benefit of men, that they\n might recover what had been extorted unjustly from them? Do we marvel that Minerva\n at Athens , Apollo at Delos , Juno at Samos , Diana at Perga, and that many other gods besides all over\n Asia and Greece , were plundered by him, when he could not keep his hands off\n the Capitol? That temple which private men are decorating and are intending to\n decorate out of their own riches, that Caius Verres would not suffer to be decorated\n by a king. \n ",
                "71":"\n And, accordingly, after he had once conceived this nefarious wickedness, he\n considered nothing in all Sicily afterwards\n sacred or hallowed; and he behaved himself in his province for three years in such a\n manner that war was thought to have been declared by him, not only against men, but\n also against the immortal gods. Segesta is a very ancient town in Sicily , O judges, which its inhabitants assert was founded by Aeneas\n when he was flying from Troy and coming to\n this country. And accordingly the Segestans think that they are connected with the\n Roman people, not only by a perpetual alliance and friendship, but even by some\n relationship. This town, as the state of the Segestans was at war with the\n Carthaginians on its own account and of its own accord, was formerly stormed and\n destroyed by the Carthaginians; and everything which could be any ornament to the\n city was transported from thence to Carthage . There was among the Segestans a statue of Diana, of brass,\n not only invested with the most sacred character, but also wrought with the most\n exquisite skill and beauty. When transferred to Carthage , it only changed its situation and its worshippers; it\n retained its former sanctity. For on account of its eminent beauty it seemed, even\n to their enemies, worthy of being most religiously worshipped. \n ",
                "72":"\n Some ages afterwards, Publius Scipio took Carthage , in the third Punic war; after which victory, (remark the\n virtue and carefulness of the man, so that you may both rejoice at your national\n examples of most eminent virtue, and may also judge tire incredible audacity of\n Verres worthy of the greater hatred by contrasting it with that virtue,) he summoned\n all the Sicilians, because he knew that during a long period of time Sicily had repeatedly been ravaged by the\n Carthaginians, and bids them seek for all they had lost, and promises them to take\n the greatest pains to ensure the restoration to the different cities of everything\n which had belonged to them. Then those things which had formerly been removed from\n Himera, and which I have mentioned before, were restored to the people of Thermae;\n some things were restored to the Gelans, some to the Agrigentines; among which was\n that noble bull, which that most cruel of all tyrants, Phalaris, is said to have\n had, into which he was accustomed to put men for punishment, and to put fire under.\n And when Scipio restored that bull to the Agrigentines, he is reported to have said,\n that he thought it reasonable for them to consider whether it was more advantageous\n to the Sicilians to be subject to their own princes, or to be under the dominion of\n the Roman people, when they had the same thing as a monument of the cruelty of their\n domestic masters, and of our liberality. \n ",
                "73":"\n At that time the same Diana of which I am speaking is restored with the greatest\n care to the Segestans. It is taken back to Segesta ; it is replaced in its ancient situation, to the greatest joy\n and delight of all the citizens. It was placed at Segesta on a very lofty pedestal,\n on which was cut in large letters the name of Publius Africanus; and a statement was\n also engraved that “he had restored it after having taken Carthage .” It was worshipped by the citizens;\n it was visited by all strangers; when I was quaestor it was the very first thing,\n they showed me. It was a very large and tall statue with a flowing robe, but in\n spite of its large size it gave the idea of the age and dress of a virgin; her\n arrows hung from her shoulder, in her left hand she carried her bow, her right hand\n held a burning torch. \n ",
                "74":"\n When that enemy of all sacred things, that violator of all religious scruples saw\n it, he began to burn with covetousness and insanity, as if he himself had been\n struck with that torch. He commands the magistrates to take the statue down and give\n it to him; and declares to them that nothing can be more agreeable to him. But they\n said that it was impossible for them to do so; that they were prevented from doing\n so, not only by the most extreme religious reverence, but also by the greatest\n respect for their own laws and courts of justice. Then he began to entreat this\n favour of them, then to threaten them, then to try and excite their hopes, then to\n arouse their fears. They opposed to his demands the name of Africanus; they said\n that it was the gift of the Roman people; that they themselves had no right over a\n thing which a most illustrious general, having taken a city of the enemy, had chosen\n to stand there as a monument of the victory of the Roman people. \n ",
                "75":"\n As he did not relax in his demand, but urged it every day with daily increasing\n earnestness, the matter was brought before their senate. His demand raises a violent\n outcry on all sides. And so at that time, and at his first arrival at Segesta , it is refused. Afterwards, whatever\n burdens could be imposed on any city in respect of exacting sailors and rowers, or\n in levying corn, he imposed on the Segestans beyond all other cities, and a good\n deal more than they could bear. Besides that, he used to summon their magistrates\n before him; he used to send for all the most noble and most virtuous of the\n citizens, to hurry them about with him to all the courts of justice in the province,\n to threaten every one of them separately to be the ruin of him, and to announce to\n them all in a body that he would utterly destroy their city. Therefore, at last, the\n Segestans, subdued by much ill-treatment and by great fear, resolved to obey the\n command of the praetor. With great grief and lamentation on the part of the whole\n city, with many tears and wailings on the part of all the men and women, a contract\n is advertised for taking down the statue of Diana. \n ",
                "76":"\n See now with what religious reverence it is regarded. Know, O judges, that among\n all the Segestans none was found, whether free man or slave, whether citizen or\n foreigner, to dare to touch that statue. Know that some barbarian workmen were\n brought from Lilybaeum ; they at length,\n ignorant of the whole business, and of the religious character of the image, agreed\n to take it down for a sum of money, and took it down. And when it was being taken\n out of the city, how great was the concourse of women! how great was the weeping of\n the old men! some of whom even recollected that day when that same Diana being\n brought back to Segesta from Carthage ,\n had announced to them, by its return, the victory of the Roman people. How different\n from that time did this day seem! then the general of the Roman people, a most\n illustrious man, was bringing back to the Segestans the gods of their fathers,\n recovered from an enemy's city; now a most base and profligate praetor of the same\n Roman people, was taking away, with the most nefarious wickedness, those very same\n gods from a city of his allies. What is more notorious throughout all Sicily than that all the matrons and virgins of\n Segesta came together when Diana was being taken out of their city? that they\n anointed her with precious unguents? that they crowned her with chaplets and\n flowers? that they attended her to the borders of their territory with frankincense\n and burning perfumes? \n ",
                "77":"\n If at the time you, by reason of your covetousness and audacity, did not, while in\n command, fear these religious feelings of the population, do you not fear them now,\n at a time of such peril to yourself and to your children? What man, against the will\n of the immortal gods, or what god, when you so trample on all the religious\n reverence due to them, do you think will come to your assistance? Has that Diana\n inspired you, while in quiet and at leisure, with no religious awe;—she, who though\n she had seen two cities, in which she was placed stormed and burnt, was yet twice\n preserved from the flames and weapons of two wars; she who, though she changed her\n situation owing to the victory of the Carthaginians, yet did not lose her holy\n character; and who, by the valour of Publius Africanus afterwards recovered her old\n worship, together with her old situation? And when this crime had been executed, as\n the pedestal was empty, and the name of Publius Africanus carved on it, the affair\n appeared scandalous and intolerable to every one, that not only was religion\n trampled on, but also that Caius Verres had taken away the glory of the exploits,\n the memorial of the virtues, the monument of the victory of Publius Africanus, that\n most gallant of men. \n ",
                "78":"\n But when he was told afterwards of the pedestal and the inscription, he thought\n that men would forget the whole affair, if he took away the pedestal to which was\n serving as a sort of signpost to point out his crime. And so, by his command, the\n Segestans contracted to take away the pedestal too; and the terms of that contract\n were read to you from the public registers of the Segestans, at the former pleading.\n Now, O Publius Scipio,\n I appeal to you; to you, I say, a most virtuous and accomplished youth; from you I\n request and demand that assistance which is due to your family and to your name. Why\n do you take the part of that man who has embezzled the credit and honour of your\n family? Why do you wish him to be defended? Why am I undertaking what is properly\n your business? Why am I supporting a burden which ought to fall on you?—Marcus\n Tullius is reclaiming the monuments of Publius Africanus; Publius Scipio is\n defending the man who took them away. Though it is a principle handed down to us\n from our ancestors, for every one to defend the monuments of his ancestors, in such\n a way as not even to allow them to be decorated by one of another name, will you\n take the part of that man who is not charged merely with having in some degree\n spoilt the view of the monuments of Publius Scipio, but who has entirely removed and\n destroyed them? \n ",
                "79":"\n Who then, in the name of the immortal gods, will defend the memory of Publius\n Scipio now that he is dead? who will defend the memorials and evidences of his\n valour, if you desert and abandon them; and not only allow them to be plundered and\n taken away, but even defend their plunderer and destroyer? The Segestans are\n present, your clients, the allies and friends of the Roman people. They inform you\n that Publius Africanus, when he had destroyed Carthage , restored the image of Diana to their ancestors; and that\n was set up among the Segestans arid dedicated in the name of that general;—that\n Verres has had it taken down and carried away, and as far as that is concerned, has\n utterly effaced and extinguished the name of Publius Scipio. They entreat and pray\n you to restore the object of their worship to them, its proper credit and glory to\n your own family, so enabling them by your assistance to recover from the house of a\n robber, what they recovered from the city of their enemies by the beneficence of\n Publius Africanus. What\n can you reply to them with honour, or what can they do but implore the aid of you\n and your good faith? They are present, they do implore it. You, O Publius, can\n protect the honour of your family renown; you can, you have every advantage which\n either fortune or nature ever gives to men. I do not wish to anticipate you in\n gathering the fruit that belongs to you; I am not covetous of the glory which ought\n to belong to another. It does not correspond to the modesty of my disposition, while\n Publius Scipio, a most promising young man, is alive and well, to put myself forward\n as the defender and advocate of the memorials of Publius Scipio. \n ",
                "80":"\n Wherefore, if you will undertake the advocacy of your family renown, it will\n behoove me not only to be silent about your monuments, but even to be glad that the\n fortune of Publius Africanus, though dead, is such, that his honour is defended by\n those who are of the same family as himself, and that it requires no adventitious\n assistance. But if your friendship with that man is an obstacle to you,—if you think\n that this thing which I demand of you is not so intimately connected with your\n duty,—then I, as your locum tenens , will succeed to\n your office, I will undertake that business which I have thought not to belong to\n me. Let that proud aristocracy give up complaining that the Roman people willingly\n gives, and at all times has given, honours to new and diligent men. It is a foolish\n complaint that virtue should be of the greatest influence in that city which by its\n virtue governs all nations. Let the image of Publius Africanus be in the houses of\n other men; let heroes now dead be adorned with virtue and glory. He was such a man,\n he deserved so well of the Roman people, that he deserves to be recommended to the\n affection, not of one single family, but of the whole state. And so it partly does\n belong to me also to defend his honours with all my power, because I belong to that\n city which he rendered great, and illustrious, and renowned; and especially, because\n I practice, to the utmost of my power, those virtues in which he was\n preeminent,—equity, industry, temperance, the protection of the unhappy, and hatred\n of the dishonest; a relationship in pursuits and habits which is almost as important\n as that of which you boast, the relationship of name and family. \n ",
                "81":"\n I reclaim from you, O Verres, the monument of Publius Africanus; I abandon the\n cause of the Sicilians, which I undertook; let there be no trial of you for\n extortion at present; never mind the injuries of the Segestans; let the pedestal of\n Publius Africanus be restored; let the name of that invincible commander be engraved\n on it anew; let that most beautiful statue, which was recovered when Carthage was taken, be replaced. It is not I,\n the defender of the Sicilians,—it is not I, your prosecutor,—they are not the\n Segestans who demand this of you; but he who has taken on himself the defence and\n the preservation of the renown and glory of Publius Africanus. I am not afraid of\n not being able to give a good account of my performance of this duty to Publius\n Servilius the judge; who, as he has performed great exploits, and raised very many\n monuments of his good deeds, and has a natural anxiety about them, will be glad,\n forsooth, to leave them an object of care and protection not only to his own\n posterity, but to all brave men and good citizens; and not as a mark for the plunder\n of rogues. I am not afraid of its displeasing you, O Quintus Catulus, to whom the\n most superb and splendid monument in the whole world belongs, that there should be\n as many guardians of such monuments as possible, or that all good men should think\n it was a part of their duty to defend the glory of another. \n ",
                "82":"\n And indeed I am so far moved by the other robberies and atrocities of that fellow,\n as to think them worthy of great reproof; but that might be sufficient for them. But\n in this instance I am roused to such indignation, that nothing appears to me\n possible to be more scandalous or more intolerable. Shall Verres adorn his house,\n full of adultery, full of debauchery, full of infamy, with the monuments of\n Africanus? Shall Verres face the memorial of that most temperate and religious man,\n the image of the ever virgin Diana, in that house in which the iniquities of harlots\n and pimps are incessantly being practised? \n ",
                "83":"\n But is this the only monument of Africanus which you have violated? What! did you\n take away from the people of Tyndaris an image of Mercury most beautifully made, and placed there by\n the beneficence of the same Scipio? And how? O ye immortal gods! How audaciously,\n how infamously, how shamelessly did you do so! You have lately, judges, heard the\n deputies from Tyndaris , most\n honourable men, and the chief men of that city, say that the Mercury, which in their\n sacred anniversaries was worshipped among them with the extremest religious\n reverence, which Publius Africanus, after he had taken Carthage , had given to the Tyndaritans, not\n only as a monument of his victory, but as a memorial and evidence of their loyalty\n to and alliance with the Roman people, had been taken away by the violence, and\n wickedness, and arbitrary power of this man; who, when he first came to their city,\n in a moment, as if it were not only a becoming, but an indispensable thing to be\n done?—as if the senate had ordered it and the Roman people had sanctioned it,—in a\n moment, I say, ordered them to take the statue down and to transport it to\n Messana . \n ",
                "84":"\n And as this appeared a scandalous thing to those who were present and who heard it,\n it was not persevered in by him during the first period of his visit; but when he\n departed, he ordered Sopater, their chief magistrate, whose statement you have\n heard, to take it down. When he refused, he threatened him violently; and then he\n left the city. The magistrate refers the matter to the senate; there is a violent\n outcry on all sides. To make my story short, some time afterwards he comes to that\n city again. Immediately he asks about the statue. He is answered that the senate\n will not allow it to be removed; that capital punishment is threatened to any one\n who should touch it without the orders of the senate: the impiety of removing is\n also urged. Then says he, “What do you mean by talking to me of impiety? or about\n punishment? or about the senate? I will not leave you alive; you shall be scourged\n to death if the statue is not given up.” Sopater with tears reports the matter to\n the senate a second time, and relates to them the covetousness and the threats of\n Verres. The senate gives Sopater no answer, but breaks up in agitation and\n perplexity. Sopater, being summoned by the praetor's messenger, informs him of the\n state of the case, and says that it is absolutely impossible. \n ",
                "85":"\n And all these things (for I do not think that I ought to omit any particular of his\n impudence) were done openly in the middle of the assembly, while Verres was sitting\n on his chair of office, in a lofty situation. It was the depth of winter; the\n weather, as you heard Sopater himself state, was bitterly cold; heavy rain was\n falling; when that fellow orders the lictors to throw Sopater headlong down from the\n portico on which he himself was sitting, and to strip him naked. The command was\n scarcely, out of his mouth, before you might have seen him stripped and surrounded\n by the lictors. All thought that the unhappy and innocent man was going to be\n scourged. They were mistaken. Do you think that Verres would scourge without any\n reason an ally and friend of the Roman people? He is not so wicked. All vices are\n not to be found in that man; he was never cruel. He treated the man with great\n gentleness and clemency. In the middle of the forum there are some statues of the\n Marcelli, as there are in most of the other towns of Sicily ; out of these he selected the statue of Caius Marcellus, whose\n services to that city and to the whole province were most recent and most important.\n On that statue he orders Sopater, a man of noble birth in his city, and at that very\n time invested with the chief magistracy, to be placed astride and bound to it. \n ",
                "86":"\n What torture he suffered when he was bound naked in the open air, in the rain and\n in the cold, must be manifest to every body. Nor did he put an end to this insult\n and barbarity, till the people and the whole multitude, moved by the atrocity of his\n conduct and by pity for his victim, compelled the senate by their outcries to\n promise him that statue of Mercury. They cried out that the immortal gods themselves\n would avenge the act, and that in the meantime it was not fit that an innocent man\n should be murdered. Then the senate comes to him in a body, and promises him the\n statue. And so Sopater is taken down scarcely alive from the statue of Marcellus, to\n which he had almost become frozen. I cannot adequately accuse that man if I were to\n wish to do so; it requires not only genius, but an extraordinary amount of skill.\n \n ",
                "87":"\n This appears to be a single crime, this of the Tyndaritan Mercury, and it is\n brought forward by me as a single one; but there are many crimes contained in\n it—only I do not know how to separate and distinguish them. It is a case of money\n extorted, for he took away from the allies a statue worth a large sum of money. It\n is a case of embezzlement, because he did not hesitate to appropriate a public\n statue belonging to the Roman people, taken from the spoils of the enemy, placed\n where it was in the name of our general. It is a case of treason, because he dared\n to overturn and to carry away monuments of our empire, of our glory, and of our\n exploits. It is a case of impiety, because he violated the most solemn principles of\n religion. It is a case of inhumanity, because he invented a new and extraordinary\n description of punishment for an innocent man, an ally and friend of our nation.\n \n ",
                "88":"\n But what the other crime is, that I am unable to say; I know not by what name to\n call the crime which he committed with respect to the statue of Caius Marcellus.\n What is the meaning of it? Is it because he was the patron of the Sicilians? What\n then? What has that to do with it? Ought that fact to have had influence to procure\n assistance, or to bring disaster on his clients and friends? Was it your object to\n show that patrons were no protection against your violence? Who is there who would\n not be aware that there is greater power in the authority of a bad man who is\n present, than in the protection of good men who are absent? Or do you merely wish to\n prove by this conduct, your unprecedented insolence, and pride, and obstinacy? You\n thought, I imagine, that you were taking something from the dignity of the Marcelli?\n And therefore now the Marcelli are not the patrons of the Sicilians. Verres has been\n substituted in their place. \n ",
                "89":"\n What virtue or what dignity did you think existed in you, that you should attempt\n to transfer to yourself, and to take away from these most trusty and most ancient\n patrons, so illustrious a body of clients as that splendid province? Can you with\n your stupidity, and worthlessness, and laziness defend the cause, I will not say of\n all Sicily , but even of one, the very\n meanest of the Sicilians? Was the statue of Marcellus to serve you for a pillory for\n the clients of the Marcelli? Did you out of his honour seek for punishments for\n those very men who had held him in honour? What followed? What did you think would\n happen to your statues? was it that which did happen? For the people of Tyndaris threw down the statue of Verres, which\n he had ordered to be erected in his own honour near the Marcelli, and even on a\n higher pedestal, the very moment that they heard that a successor had been appointed\n to him. The fortune of\n the Sicilians has then given you Caius Marcellus for a judge, so that we may now\n surrender you, fettered and bound, to appease the injured sanctity of him to whose\n statue Sicilians were bound while you were praetor. \n ",
                "90":"\n And in the first place, O judges, that man said that the people of Tyndaris had sold this statue to Caius Marcellus\n Aeserninus, who is here present. And he hoped that Caius Marcellus himself would\n assert thus much for his sake though it never seemed to me to be very likely that a\n young man born in that rank, the patron of Sicily , would lend his name to that fellow to enable him to transfer\n his guilt to another. But still I made such provision, and took such precaution\n against every possible bearing of the case, that if ally one had been found who was\n ever so anxious to take the guilt and crime of Verres upon himself, still he would\n not have taken anything by his motion, for I brought down to court such witnesses,\n and I had with me such written documents, that it could not have been possible to\n have entertained a doubt about that man's actions. \n ",
                "91":"\n There are public documents to prove that that Mercury was transported to Messana at the expense of the state. They state at\n what expense; and that a man named Poleas was ordered by the public authority to\n superintend the business—what more would you have? Where is he? He is close at hand,\n he is a witness, by the command of Sopater the Proagorus.—Who is he? The man who was\n bound to the statue. What? where is he? He is a witness—you have seen the man, and\n you have heard his statement. Demetrius, the master of the gymnastic school,\n superintended the pulling down of the statue, because he was appointed to manage\n that business; What? is it we who say this? No, he is present himself; moreover,\n that Verres himself lately promised at Rome , that he would restore that statue to the deputies, if the\n evidence already given in the affair were removed, and if security were given that\n the Tyndaritans would not give evidence against him, has been stated before you by\n Zosippus and Hismenias, most noble men, and the chief men of the city of Tyndaris . \n ",
                "92":"\n What? did you not also at Agrigentum take\n away a monument of the same Publius Scipio, a most beautiful statue of Apollo, on\n whose thigh there was the name of Myron, inscribed in diminutive silver letters, out\n of that most holy temple of Aesculapius? And when, O judges, he had privately\n committed that atrocity, and when in that most nefarious crime and robbery he had\n employed some of the most worthless men of the city as his guides and assistants,\n the whole city was greatly excited. For the Agrigentines were regretting at the same\n time the kindness of Africanus, and a national object of their worship, and an\n ornament of their city, and a record of their victory, and an evidence of their\n alliance with us. And therefore a command is imposed on those men who were the chief\n men of the city, and a charge is given to the quaestors and aediles to keep watch by\n night over the sacred edifices. And, indeed, at Agrigentum , (I imagine, on account of the great number and virtue of\n these men, and because great numbers of Roman citizens, gallant and intrepid and\n honourable men, live and trade in that town among the Agrigentines in the greatest\n harmony,) he did not dare openly to carry off, or even to beg for the things that\n took his fancy. \n ",
                "93":"\n There is a temple of Hercules at Agrigentum , not far from the forum, considered very holy and greatly\n reverenced among the citizens. In it there is a brazen image of Hercules himself,\n than which I cannot easily tell where I have seen anything finer; (although I am not\n very much of a judge of those matters, though I have seen plenty of specimens;) so\n greatly venerated among them, O judges, that his mouth and his chin are a little\n worn away, because men in addressing their prayers and congratulations to him, are\n accustomed not only to worship the statue, but even to kiss it. While Verres was at\n Agrigentum , on a sudden, one stormy\n night, a great assemblage of armed slaves, and a great attack on this temple by\n them, takes place, under the leading of Timarchides. A cry is raised by the watchmen\n and guardians of the temple. And, at first, when they attempted to resist them and\n to defend the temple, they are driven back much injured with sticks and bludgeons.\n Afterwards, when the bolts were forced open, and the doors dashed in, they endeavour\n to pull down the statue and to overthrow it with levers; meantime, from the outcries\n of the keepers, a report got abroad over the whole city, that the national gods were\n being stormed, not by the unexpected invasion of enemies, or by the sudden irruption\n of pirates, but that a well armed and fully equipped band of fugitive slaves from\n the house and retinue of the praetor had attacked them. \n ",
                "94":"\n No one in Agrigentum was either so advanced\n in age, or so infirm in strength, as not to rise up on that night, awakened by that\n news, and to seize whatever weapon chance put into his hands. So in a very short\n time men are assembled at the temple from every part of the city. Already, for more\n than an hour, numbers of men had been labouring at pulling down that statue; and all\n that time it gave no sign of being shaken in any part; while some, putting levers\n under it, were endeavouring to throw it down, and others, having bound cords to all\n its limbs, were trying to pull it towards them. On a sudden all the Agrigentines\n collect together at the place; stones are thrown in numbers; the nocturnal soldiers\n of that illustrious commander run away—but they take with them two very small\n statues, in order not to return to that robber of all holy things entirely\n empty-handed. The Sicilians are never in such distress as not to be able to say\n something facetious and neat; as they did on this occasion. And so they said that\n this enormous boar had a right to be accounted one of the labours of Hercules, no\n less than the other boar of Erymanthus. \n ",
                "95":"\n The people of Assorum, gallant and loyal men, afterwards imitated this brave\n conduct of the Agrigentines, though they did not come of so powerful or so\n distinguished a city. There is a river called Chrysas, which flows through the\n territories of Assorum. Chrysas, among that people, is considered a god, and is\n worshipped with the greatest reverence. His temple is in the fields, near the road\n which goes from Assorum to Enna . In it\n there is an image of Chrysas, exquisitely made of marble. He did not dare to beg\n that of the Assorians on account of the extraordinary sanctity of that temple; so he\n entrusts the business to Tlepolemus and Hiero. They, having prepared and armed a\n body of men, come by night; they break in the doors of the temple; the keepers of\n the temple and the guardians hear them in time. A trumpet the signal of alarm well\n known to all the neighbourhood, is sounded; men come in from the country, Tlepolemus\n is turned out and put to fight; nor was anything missed out of the temple of Chrysas\n except one very diminutive image of brass. \n ",
                "96":"\n There is a temple of the mighty mother Cybele at Enguinum, for I must new not only\n mention each instance with the greatest brevity, but I must even pass over a great\n many, in order to come to the greater and more remarkable thefts and atrocities of\n this sort which this man has committed. In this temple that same Publius Scipio, a\n man excelling in every possible good quality, had placed breastplates and helmets of\n brass of Corinthian workmanship, and some huge ewers of a similar description, and\n wrought with the same exquisite skill, and had inscribed his own name upon them. Why\n should I make any more statements or utter any further complaints about that man's\n conduct? He took away, O judges, every one of those things. He left nothing in that\n most holy temple except the traces of the religion he had trampled on, and the name\n of Publius Scipio. The spoils won from the enemy, the memorials of our commanders,\n the ornaments and decorations of our temples, will hereafter, when these illustrious\n names are lost, be reckoned in the furniture and appointments of Caius Verres. \n ",
                "97":"\n Are you, forsooth, the only man who delights in Corinthian vases? Are you the best\n judge in the world of the mixture of that celebrated bronze, and of the delicate\n tracery of that work? Did not the great Scipio, that most learned and accomplished\n mall, under stand it too? But do you, a man without one single virtue, without\n education, without natural ability, and without any information, understand them and\n value them? Beware lest he be seen to have surpassed you and those other men who\n wished to be thought so elegant, not only in temperance, but in judgment and taste;\n for it was because he thoroughly understood how beautiful they were, that he thought\n that they were made, not for the luxury of men, but for the ornamenting of temples\n and cities, in order that they might appear to our posterity to be holy and sacred\n monuments. \n ",
                "98":"\n Listen also, O judges, to the man's singular covetousness, audacity and madness,\n especially in polluting those sacred things, which not only may not be touched with\n the hands, but which may not be violated even in thought. There is a shrine of\n Ceres among the Catenans of the same holy\n nature as the one at home, and worshipped as the goddess is worshipped among foreign\n nations, and in almost every country in the world. In the inmost part of that shrine\n there was an extremely ancient statue of\n Ceres , as to which men were not only\n ignorant of what sort it was, but even of its existence. For the entrance into that\n shrine does not belong to men, the sacred ceremonies are accustomed to be performed\n by women and virgins. Verres's slaves stole this statue by night out of that most\n holy and most ancient temple. The next day the priestesses of\n Ceres , and the female attendants of that\n temple, women of great age, noble and of proved virtue, report the affair to their\n magistrates. It appeared to all a most bitter, and scandalous, and miserable\n business. \n ",
                "99":"\n Then that man, influenced by the atrocity of the action, in order that all\n suspicion of that crime might be removed from himself, employs some one connected\n with him by ties of hospitality to find a man whom he might accuse of having done\n it, and bids him take care that he be convicted of the accusation, so that he\n himself might not be subject to the charge. The matter is not delayed. For when he\n had departed from Catina , an information is\n laid against a certain slave. He is accused; false witnesses are suborned against\n him; the whole senate sits in judgment on the affair, according to the laws of the\n Catenans. The priestesses are summoned; they are examined secretly in the\n senate-house, and asked what had been done, and how they thought that the statue had\n been carried off. They answer that the servants of the praetor had been seen in the\n temple. The matter, which previously had not been very obscure, began to be clear\n enough by the evidence of the priestesses. The judges deliberate; the innocent slave\n is acquitted by every vote, in order that you may the more easily be able to condemn\n this man by all your votes. \n ",
                "100":"\n For what is it that you ask, O Verres? What do you hope for? What do you expect?\n What god or man do you think will come to your assistance? Did you send slaves to\n that place to plunder a temple, where it was not lawful for free citizens to go, not\n even for the purpose of praying? Did you not hesitate to lay violent hands on those\n things from which the laws of religion enjoined you to keep even your eyes? Although\n it was not even because you were charmed by the eye that you were led into this\n wicked and nefarious conduct; for you coveted what you had never seen. You took a\n violent fancy, I say, to that which you had not previously beheld. From your ears\n did you conceive this covetousness, so violent that no fear, no religious scruple,\n no power of the gods, no regard for the opinion of men could restrain it. \n ",
                "101":"\n Oh! but you had heard of it, I suppose, from some good man, from some good\n authority. How could you have done that, when you could never have heard of it from\n any man at all? You heard of it, therefore, from a woman; since men could not have\n seen it nor known of it. What sort of woman do you think that she must have been, O\n judges? What a modest woman must she have been to converse with Verres! What a pious\n woman, to show him a plan for robbing a temple! But it is no great wonder if those\n sacred ceremonies which are performed by the most extreme chastity of virgins and\n matrons were violated by his adultery and profligacy. What, then, are we to think? Is this the\n only thing that he began to desire from mere hearing, when he had never seen it\n himself? No, there were many other things besides; of which I will select the\n plundering of that most noble and ancient temple, concerning which you heard\n witnesses give their evidence at the former pleading. Now, I beseech you, listen to\n the same story once more, and attend carefully as you hitherto have done. \n ",
                "102":"\n There is an island called Melita , O\n judges, separated from Sicily by a\n sufficiently wide and perilous navigation, in which there is a town of the same\n name, to which Verres never went, though it was for three years a manufactory to him\n for weaving women's garments. Not far from that town, on a promontory, is an ancient\n temple of Juno, which was always considered so holy, that it was not only always\n kept inviolate and sacred in those Punic wars, which in those regions were carried\n on almost wholly by the naval forces, but even by the bands of pirates which ravage\n those seas. Moreover, it has been handed down to us by tradition, that once, when\n the fleet of King Masinissa was forced to put into these ports, the king's\n lieutenant took away some ivory teeth of an incredible size out of the temple, and\n carried them into Africa , and gave them to\n Masinissa; that at first the king was delighted with the present, but afterwards,\n when he heard where they had come from, he immediately sent trustworthy men in a\n quinquereme to take those teeth back; and that there was engraved on them in Punic\n characters, “that Masinissa the king had accepted them ignorantly; but that, when he\n knew the truth, he had taken care that they should be replaced and restored.” There\n was besides an immense quantity of ivory, and many ornaments, among which were some\n ivory victories of ancient workmanship, and wrought with exquisite skill. \n ",
                "103":"\n Not to dwell too long on this, he took care to have all these things taken down and\n carried off at one swoop by means of the slaves of the Venus whom he had sent\n thither for that purpose. \n O ye immortal gods! what sort of man is it that I am accusing? Who is it that I am\n prosecuting according to our laws, and by this regular process? Concerning whom is\n it that you are going to give your judicial decision? The deputies from Melita sent by the public authority of their state,\n say that the shrine of Juno was plundered; that that man left nothing in that most\n holy temple; that that place, to which the fleets of enemies often came, where\n pirates are accustomed to winter almost every year, and which no pirate ever\n violated, no enemy ever attacked before, was so plundered by that single man, that\n nothing whatever was left in it. What, then, now are we to say of him as a\n defendant, of me as an accuser, of this tribunal? Is he proved guilty of grave\n crimes, or is he brought into this court on mere suspicion? Gods are proved to have\n been carried off, temples to have been plundered, cities to have been stripped of\n everything. And of those actions he has left himself no power of denying one, no\n plea for defending one. In every particular he is convicted by me; he is detected by\n the witnesses; he is overwhelmed by his own admissions; he is caught in the evident\n commission of guilt; and even now he remains here, and in silence recognises his own\n crimes as I enumerate them. \n ",
                "104":"\n I seem to myself to have been too long occupied with one\n class of crime. I am aware, O judges, that I have to encounter the weariness of your\n ears and eyes at such a repetition of similar cases; I will, therefore, pass over\n many instances. But I entreat you, O judges, in the name of the immortal gods, in\n the name of these very gods of whose honour and worship we have been so long\n speaking, refresh your minds so as to attend to what I am about to mention, while I\n bring forward and detail to you that crime of his by which the whole province was\n roused, and in speaking of which you will pardon me if I appear to go back rather\n far, and trace the earliest recollections of the religious observances in question.\n The importance of the affair will not allow me to pass over the atrocity of his\n guilt with brevity. \n ",
                "105":"\n It is an old opinion, O judges, which can be proved from the most ancient records\n and monuments of the Greeks, that the whole island of Sicily was consecrated to\n Ceres and Libera. Not only did all other\n nations think so but the Sicilians themselves were so convinced of it, that it\n appeared a deeply rooted and innate belief in their minds. For they believe that\n these goddesses were born in these districts, and that corn was first discovered in\n this land, and that Libera was carried off, the same goddess whom they call\n Proserpina, from a grove in the territory of Enna , a place which, because it is situated in the centre of the\n island, is called the navel of Sicily . And\n when Ceres wished to seek her and trace her\n out, she is said to have lit her torches at those flames which burst out at the\n summit of Aetna , and carrying these torches\n before her, to have wandered over the whole earth. \n ",
                "106":"\n But Enna , where those things which I am\n speaking of are said to have been done, is in a high and lofty situation, on the top\n of which is a large level plain, and springs of water which are never dry. And the\n whole of the plain is cut off and separated, so as to be difficult of approach.\n Around it are many lakes and groves, and beautiful flowers at every season of the\n year; so that the place itself appears to testify to that abduction of the virgin\n which we have heard of from our boyhood. Near it is a cave turned towards the north, of unfathomable depth,\n where they say that Father Pluto suddenly rose out of the earth in his chariot, and\n carried the virgin off from that spot, and that on a sudden, at no great distance\n from Syracuse , he went down beneath\n the earth, and that immediately a lake sprang up in that place; and there to this\n day the Syracusans celebrate anniversary festivals with a most numerous assemblage\n of both sexes On account\n of the antiquity of this belief, because in those places the traces and almost the\n cradles of those gods are found, the worship of\n Ceres of Enna prevails to a wonderful extent, both in private and in public\n over all Sicily . In truth, many prodigies\n often attest her influence and divine powers. Her present help is often brought to\n many in critical circumstances, so that this island appears not only to be loved,\n but also to be watched over and protected by her. \n ",
                "107":"\n Nor is it the Sicilians only, but even all other tribes and nations greatly worship\n Ceres of Enna . In truth, if initiation into those sacred mysteries of the\n Athenians sought for with the greatest avidity, to which people\n Ceres is said to have come in that long\n wandering of hers, and then she brought them corn. How much greater reverence ought\n to be paid to her by those people among whom it is certain that she was born, and\n first discovered corn. And, therefore, in the time of our fathers, at a most\n disastrous and critical time to the republic, when, after the death of Tiberius\n Gracchus, there was a fear that great dangers were portended to the state by various\n prodigies, in the consulship of Publius Mucius and Lucius Calpurnius, recourse was\n had to the Sibylline books, in which it was found set down, “that the most ancient\n Ceres ought to be appeased.” Then,\n priests of the Roman people, selected from the most honourable college of decemvirs,\n although there was in our own city a most beautiful and magnificent temple of\n Ceres , nevertheless went as far as\n Enna . For such was the authority and\n antiquity of the reputation for holiness of that place, that when they went thither,\n they seemed to be going not to a temple of\n Ceres , but to\n Ceres herself. \n ",

I have been some time afraid that my\n speech may appear unlike the usual fashion of speeches at trials unlike the daily\n method of speaking. This I say, that this very Ceres , the most ancient, the most holy, the very chief of all sacred\n things which are honoured by every people, and in every nation, was carried off by\n Caius Verres from her temple and her home. Ye who have been to Enna , have seen a statue of\n Ceres made of marble, and in the other\n temple a statue of Libera. They are very colossal and very beautiful, but not\n exceedingly ancient. There was one of brass, of moderate size, but extraordinary\n workmanship, with the torches in its hands, very ancient, by far the most ancient of\n all those statues which are in that temple; that he carried off, and yet he was not\n content with that. \n ",

But in the right hand of\n Ceres there stood a beautifully wrought image\n of Victory, and this he had wrenched out of the hand of\n Ceres and carried off. What now must be his feelings at the\n recollection of his crimes, when I, at the mere enumeration of them, am not only\n roused to indignation in my mind, but even shudder over my whole body? For thoughts\n of that temple, of that place, of that holy religion come into my mind. Everything\n seems present before my eyes,—the day on which, when I had arrived at Enna , the priests of\n Ceres came to meet me with garlands of\n vervain, and with fillets; the concourse of citizens, among whom, while I was\n addressing them, there was such weeping and groaning that the most bitter grief\n seemed to have taken possession of the whole. \n ",

It was the divinity of\n Ceres , the antiquity of their sacred\n observances, the holy veneration due to their temple, which they wished should have\n atonement made to them by the punishment of that most atrocious and audacious man.\n They said that they could endure everything else, that to everything else they were\n indifferent. This indignation of theirs was so great, that you might suppose that\n Verres, like another king of hell, had come to Enna and had carried off, not Proserpina, but\n Ceres herself. And, in truth, that city\n does not appear to be a city, but a shrine of\n Ceres . The people of Enna think that\n Ceres dwells among them; so that they\n appear to me not to be citizens of that city, but to be all priests, to be all\n ministers and officers of Ceres . \n ",

For while Publius\n Popillius and Publius Rupilius were consuls, slaves, runaway slaves, and barbarians,\n and enemies, were in possession of that place; but yet the slaves ware not so much\n slaves to their own masters, as you are to your passions; nor did the runaways flee\n from their masters as far as you flee from all laws and from all right; nor were the\n barbarians as barbarous in language and in race as you were in your nature and your\n habits; nor were the enemies as much enemies to men as you are to the immortal gods.\n How, then, can a man beg for any mercy who has surpassed slaves in baseness, runaway\n slaves in rashness, barbarians in wickedness, and enemies in inhumanity? \n ",

And if they obtained it then they were to adhere to the ancient customs\n of the state of Enna , not to give any\n public testimony against him although he had oppressed Sicily , since these were the principles which they had received from\n their ancestors.

The injuries done to our allies are the present\n question; the authority of the laws is at stake; the reputation and the honesty of\n our courts of justice is at stake. And though all these are great considerations,\n yet this is the greatest of all,—the whole province is so imbued with religious\n feeling, such a superstitious dread arising out of that man's conduct has seized\n upon the minds of all the Sicilians, that whatever public or private misfortunes\n happen, appear to befall them because of that man's wickedness. \n ",
                "113":"\n You have heard the Centuripans, the Agyrians, the Catenans, the Herbitans, the\n Ennans, and many other deputies say, in the name of their states, how great was the\n solitude in their districts, how great the devastation, how universal the flight of\n the cultivators of the soil how deserted, how uncultivated, how desolate every place\n was. And although there are many and various injuries done by that man to which\n these things are owing, still this one cause, in the opinion of the Sicilians, is\n the most weighty of all; for, because of the insults offered to\n Ceres , they believe that all the crops\n and gifts of Ceres have perished in these\n districts. Bring remedies, O judges, to the insulted religion of the allies;\n preserve your own, for this is not a foreign religion, nor one with which you have\n no concern. But even if it were, if you were unwilling to adopt it yourselves, still\n you ought to be willing to inflict heavy punishment on the man who had violated it.\n \n ",
                "114":"\n But now that the common religion of all nations is attacked in this way, now that\n these sacred observances are violated which our ancestors adopted and imported from\n foreign countries, and have honoured ever since,—sacred observances, which they\n called Greek observances, as in truth they were,—even if we were to wish to be\n indifferent and cold about these matters, how could we be so? I will mention the sacking of one city,\n also, and that the most beautiful and highly decorated of all, the city of\n Syracuse . And I will produce my\n proofs of that, O judges, in order at length to conclude and bring to an end the\n whole history of offences of this sort. There is scarcely any one of you who has not\n often heard how Syracuse was taken by\n Marcus Marcellus, and who has not sometimes also read the account in our annals.\n Compare this peace with that war; the visit of this praetor with the victory of that\n general; the debauched retinue of the one with the invincible army of the other; the\n lust of Verres with the continence of Marcellus;—and you will say that Syracuse was built by the man who took it; was\n taken by the man who received it well established and flourishing. \n ",
                "115":"\n And for the present I omit those things which will be mentioned, and have been\n already mentioned by me in an irregular manner in different parts of my speech—what\n the market-place of the Syracusans, which at the entrance of Marcellus was preserved\n unpolluted by slaughter, on the arrival of Verres overflowed with the blood of\n innocent Sicilians; that the harbour of the Syracusans, which at that time was shut\n against both our fleets and those of the Carthaginians, was, while Verres was\n praetor, open to Cilician pirates, or even to a single piratical galley. I say\n nothing of the violence offered to people of noble birth, of the ravishment of\n matrons, atrocities which then, when the city was taken, were not committed, neither\n through the hatred of enemies, nor through military licence, nor through the customs\n of war or the rights of victory. I pass over, I say, all these things which were\n done by that man for three whole years. Listen rather to acts which are connected\n with those matters of which I have hitherto been speaking. \n ",
                "116":"\n You have often heard that the city of Syracuse is the greatest of the Greek cities, and the most beautiful\n of all. It is so, O judges, as it is said to be; for it is so by its situation,\n which is strongly fortified, and which is on every side by which you can approach\n it, whether by sea or land, very beautiful to behold. And it has harbours almost\n enclosed within the walls, and in the sight of the whole city, harbours which have\n different entrances, but which meet together, and are connected at the other end. By\n their union a part of the town, which is called the island, being separated from the\n rest by a narrow arm of the sea, is again joined to and connected with the other by\n a bridge. \n ",
                "117":"\n That city is so great that it may be said to consist of four cities of the largest\n size; one of which, as I have said, is that “Island,” which, surrounded by two\n harbours, projects out towards the mouth and entrance of each. In it there is a\n palace which did belong to king Hiero, which our praetors are in the habit of using;\n in it are many sacred buildings, but two, which have a great pre-eminence over all\n the others,—one a temple of Diana, and the other one, which before the arrival of\n that man was the most ornamented of all, sacred to Minerva. At the end of this\n island is a fountain of sweet water, the name of which is Arethusa, of incredible\n size, very full of fish, which would be entirely overwhelmed by the waves of the\n sea, if it were not protected from the sea by a rampart and dam of stone. \n ",
                "118":"\n There is also another city at Syracuse , the name of which is Achradina, in which there is a very\n large forum, most beautiful porticoes, a highly decorated town-hall, a most spacious\n senate-house, and a superb temple of Jupiter Olympius; and the other districts of\n the city are joined together by one broad unbroken street, and divided by many cross\n streets, and by private houses. There is a third city, which because in that\n district there is an ancient temple of Fortune, is called Tyche, in which there is a\n spacious gymnasium, and many sacred buildings, and that district is the most\n frequented and the most populous. There is also a fourth city, which, because it is\n the last built, is called Neapolis , in\n the highest part of which there is a very large theatre, and, besides that there are\n two temples of great beauty, one of Ceres ,\n the other of Libera, and a statue of Apollo, which is called Temenites, very\n beautiful and of colossal size; which, if he could have moved them, he would not\n have hesitated to carry off. \n ",
                "119":"\n Now I will return to Marcellus, that I may not appear to have entered into this\n statement without any reason. He, when with his powerful army he had taken this\n splendid city, did not think it for the credit of the Roman people to destroy and\n extinguish this splendour, especially as no danger could possibly arise from it, and\n therefore he spared all the buildings, public as well as private, sacred as well as\n ordinary, as if he had come with his army for the purpose of defending them, not of\n taking them by storm. With respect to the decorations of the city, he had a regard\n to his own victory, and a regard to humanity, he thought it was due to his victory\n to transport man, things to Rome which\n might be an ornament to this city, and due to humanity not utterly to strip the\n city, especially as it was one which he was anxious to preserve. \n ",
                "120":"\n In this division of the ornaments, the victory of Marcellus did not covet more for\n the Roman people than his humanity reserved to the Syracusans. The things which were\n transported to Rome we see before the\n temples of Honour and of Virtue, and also in other places. He put nothing in his own\n house, nothing in his gardens, nothing in his suburban villa; he thought that his\n house could only be an ornament to the city if he abstained from carrying the\n ornaments which belonged to the city to his own house. But he left many things of\n extraordinary beauty at Syracuse ; he\n violated not the respect due to any god; he laid hands on none. Compare Verres with\n him; not to compare the man with the man,—no such injury must be done to such a man\n as that, dead though he be; but to compare a state of peace with one of war, a state\n of law and order, and regular jurisdiction, with one of violence and martial law,\n and the supremacy of arms; to compare the arrival and retinue of the one with the\n victory and army of the other. ",
                "121":"There is a temple of Minerva in the island, of\n which I have already spoken, which Marcellus did not touch, which he left full of\n its treasures and ornaments, but which was so stripped and plundered by Verres, that\n it seems to have been in the hands, not of any enemy,—for enemies, even in war,\n respect the rites of religion, and the customs of the country,—but of some barbarian\n pirates. There was a cavalry battle of their king Agathocles, exquisitely painted in\n a series of pictures, and with these pictures the inside walls of the temple were\n covered. Nothing could be more noble than those paintings; there was nothing at\n Syracuse that was thought more worthy\n going to see. These pictures, Marcus Marcellus, though by that victory of his he had\n divested everything of its sacred inviolability of character, still, out of respect\n for religion, never touched; Verres, though, in consequence of the long peace, and\n the loyalty of the Syracusan people, he had received them as sacred and under the\n protection of religion, took away all those pictures, and left naked and unsightly\n those walls whose decorations had remained inviolate for so many ages, and had\n escaped so many wars: \n ",
                "122":"\n Marcellus, who had vowed that if he took Syracuse he would erect two temples at Rome , was unwilling to adorn the temple which he was going to build\n with these treasures which were his by right of capture; Verres, who was bound by no\n vows to Honour or Virtue, as Marcellus was, but only to Venus and to Cupid,\n attempted to plunder the temple of Minerva. The one was unwilling to adorn gods in\n the spoil taken from gods, the other transferred the decorations of the virgin\n Minerva to the house of a prostitute. Besides this, he took away out of the same\n temple twenty-seven more pictures beautifully painted; among which were likenesses\n of the kings and tyrants of Sicily , which\n delighted one, not only by the skill of the painter, but also by reminding us of the\n men, and by enabling us to recognise their persons. And see now, how much worse a\n tyrant this man proved to the Syracusans than any of the old ones, as they, cruel as\n they were, still adorned the temples of the immortal gods, while this man took away\n the monuments and ornaments from the gods. \n ",
                "123":"\n But now what shall I say of the folding-doors of that temple? I am afraid that\n those who have not seen these things may think that I am speaking too highly of, and\n exaggerating everything, though no one ought to suspect that I should be so\n inconsiderate as to be selling that so many men of the highest reputation,\n especially when they are judges in this cause, who have been at Syracuse , and who have seen all these things\n themselves, should be witnesses to my rashness and falsehood. I am able to prove\n this distinctly, O judges, that no more magnificent doors, none more beautifully\n wrought of gold and ivory, ever existed in an, temple. It is incredible how many\n Greeks have left written accounts of the beauty of these doors: they, perhaps, may\n admire and extol them too much; be it so, still it is more honourable for our\n republic, O judges, that our general, in a time of war, should have left those\n things which appeared to them so beautiful, than that our praetor should have\n carried them off in a time of peace. On the folding-doors were some subjects most\n minutely executed in ivory; all these he caused to be taken out; he tore off and\n took away a very tine head of the Gorgon with snakes for hair; and he showed, too,\n that he was influenced not only by admiration for the workmanship, but by a desire\n of money and gain; for he did not hesitate to take away also all the golden knobs\n from these folding-doors, which were numerous and heavy; and it was not the\n workmanship of these, but the weight which pleased him. And so he left the\n folding-doors in such state, that, though they had formerly contributed greatly to\n the ornament of the temple, they now seemed to have been made only for the purpose\n of shutting it up. \n ",
                "124":"\n Am I to speak also of the spears made of grass? for I saw that you were excited at\n the name of them when the witnesses mentioned them. They were such that it was\n sufficient to have seen them once, as there was neither any manual labour in them,\n nor any beauty, but simply an incredible size, which it would be quite sufficient\n even to hear of, and too much to see them more than once. Did you covet even those?\n \n ",
                "125":"\n For the Sappho which was taken away out of the town-hall affords you so reasonable\n an excuse, that it may seem almost allowable and pardonable. That work of Silanion,\n so perfect, so elegant, so elaborate, (I will not say what private man, but) what\n nation could be so worthy to possess, as the most elegant and learned Verres?\n Certainly, nothing will be said against it. If any one of us, who are not as happy,\n who cannot be as refined as that man, should wish to behold anything of the sort,\n let him go to the temple of Good Fortune, to the monument of Catulus, to the portico\n of Metellus; let him take pains to get admittance into the Tusculan villa of any one\n of those men; let him see the forum when decorated, if Verres is ever so kind as to\n lend any of his treasures to the aediles. Shall Verres have all these things at\n home? shall Verres have his house full of his villas crammed with, the ornaments of\n temples and cities? Will you still, O judges, bear with the hobby, as he calls it,\n and pleasures of this vile artisan? a man who was born in such a rank, educated in\n such a way, and who is so formed both in mind and body, that he appears a much\n fitter person to take down statues than to appropriate them. \n ",
                "126":"\n And how great a regret this Sappho which he carried off left behind her, can\n scarcely be told; for in the first place it was admirably made, and, besides, it had\n a very noble Greek epigram engraved upon the pedestal; and would not that learned\n man, that Grecian, who is such an acute judge of these matters, who is the only man\n who understands them, if he had understood one letter of Greek, have taken that away\n too? for now, because it is engraved on an empty pedestal, it both declares what was\n once, on the pedestal, and proves that it has been taken away. What shall I say\n more? Did you not take away the statue of Paean from out of the temple of\n Aesculapius, beautifully made, sacred, and holy as it was? a statue which all men\n went to see for its beauty, and worshipped for its sacred character. What more? was\n not the statue of Aristaeus openly taken away by your command out of the temple of\n Bacchus? \n ",
                "127":"\n What more? did you not take away out of the temple of\n Jupiter that most holy statue of Jupiter\n Imperator, which the Greeks call *)/ourios , most\n beautifully made? What next? did you hesitate to take away out of the temple of\n Libera, that most exquisite bust of Parian marble, which we used to go to see? And\n that Paean used to be worshipped among that people together with Aesculapius, with\n anniversary sacrifices. Aristaeus, who being, as the Greeks report, the son of\n Bacchus, is said to have been the inventor of oil, was consecrated among them\n together with his father Bacchus, in the same temple. \n ",
                "128":"\n But how great do you suppose was the honour paid to Jupiter Imperator in his own\n temple? You may collect it from this consideration, if you recollect how great was\n the religious reverence attached to that statue of the same appearance and form\n which Flaminius brought out of Macedonia ,\n and placed in the Capitol. In truth, there were said to be in the whole world three\n statues of Jupiter Imperator, of the same class, all beautifully made: one was that\n one from Macedonia , which we have seen in\n the Capitol; a second was the one at the narrow straits, which are the mouth of the\n Euxine Sea ; the third was that which was\n at Syracuse , till Verres came as\n praetor. Flaminius removed the first from its habitation, but only to place it in\n the Capitol, that is to say, in the house of Jupiter upon earth. \n ",
                "129":"\n But as to the one that is at the entrance of the Euxine, that, though so many wars\n have proceeded from the shores of that sea, and though so many have been poured into\n Pontus , has still remained inviolate and\n untouched to this day. This third one, which was at Syracuse , which Marcus Marcellus, when in arms\n and victorious, had seen, which he had spared to the religion of the place, which\n both the citizens of, and settlers in Syracuse were used to worship, and strangers not only visited, but\n often venerated, Caius Verres took away from the temple of\n Jupiter . \n ",
                "130":"\n To return again to Marcellus. Judge of the case, O judges, in this way; think that\n more gods were lost to the Syracusans owing to the arrival of Verres, than even were\n owing to the victory of Marcellus. In truth, he is said to have sought diligently\n for the great Archimedes, a man of the highest genius and skill, and to have been\n greatly concerned when he heard that he had been killed; but that other man sought\n for everything which he did seek for, not for the purpose of preserving it, but of\n carrying it away. At\n present, then, all those things which might appear more insignificant, I will on\n that account pass over—how he took away Delphic tables made of marble, beautiful\n goblets of brass, an immense number of Corinthian vases, out of every saved temple\n at Syracuse ; \n ",
                "131":"\n and therefore, O judges, those men who are accustomed to take strangers about to\n all those things which are worth going to see, and to show them every separate\n thing, whom they call mystagogi, (or cicerones,) now have their description of\n things reversed; for as they formerly used to show what there was in every place, so\n now they show what has been taken from every place. What do\n you think, then? Do you think that those men are affected with but a moderate\n indignation? Not so, O judges: in the first place, because all men are influenced by\n religious feeling, and think that their paternal gods, whom they have received from\n their ancestors, are to be carefully worshipped and retained by themselves; and\n secondly, because this sort of ornament, these works and specimens of art, these\n statues and paintings, delight men of Greek extraction to an excessive degree;\n therefore by their complaints we can understand that these things appear most bitter\n to those men, which perhaps may seem trifling and contemptible to us. Believe me, O\n judges, although I am aware to a certainty that you yourselves hear the same things,\n that though both our allies and foreign nations have during these past years\n sustained many calamities and injuries, yet men of Greek extraction have not been,\n and are not, more indignant at any than at this ruthless plundering of their temples\n and altars. \n ",
                "132":"\n Although that man may say that he bought these things, as he is accustomed to say,\n yet, believe me in this, O judges,—no city in all Asia or in all Greece has ever\n sold one statue, one picture, or one decoration of the city, of its own free will to\n anybody. Unless, perchance, you suppose that, after strict judicial decisions had\n ceased to take place at Rome , the Greeks\n then began to sell these things, which they not only did not sell when there were\n courts of justice open, but which they even used to buy up; or unless you think that\n Lucius Crassus, Quintus Scaevola, Caius Claudius, most, powerful men, whose most\n splendid aedileships we have seen had no dealings in those sort of matters with the\n Greeks, but that those men had such dealings who became aediles after the\n destruction of the courts of justice. \n ",
                "133":"\n Know also that that false presence of purchase was more bitter to the cities than\n if any one were privately to filch things, or boldly to steal them and carry them\n off. For they think it the most excessive baseness, that it should be entered on the\n public records that the city was induced by a price, and by a small price too, to\n sell and alienate those things which it had received from men of old. In truth, the\n Greeks delight to a marvellous degree in those things, which we despise. And\n therefore our ancestors willingly allowed those things to remain in numbers among\n the allies, in order that they might be as splendid and as flourishing as possible\n under our dominion; and among those nations whom they rendered taxable or tributary,\n still they left these\n things, in order that they who take delight in those things which to us seem\n insignificant, might have them as pleasures and consolations in slavery. \n ",
                "134":"\n What do you think that the Rhegians, who now are Roman citizens, would take to\n allow that marble Venus to be taken from them? What would the Tarentines take to\n lose the Europa sitting on the Bull? or the Satyr which they have in the temple of\n Vesta? or their other monuments? What would the Thespians take to lose the statue of\n Cupid, the only object for which any one ever goes to see Thespiae ? What would the men of Cnidos take for their marble Venus? or the Coans for\n their picture of her? or the Ephesians for Alexander? the men of Cyzicus for their Ajax or Medea? What would the\n Rhodians take for Ialysus ? the Athenians\n for their marble Bacchus, or their picture of Paralus, or their brazen Heifer, the\n work of Myron? It would be a long business and an unnecessary one, to mention what\n is worth going to see among all the different nations in all Asia and Greece ; but that is the reason why I am enumerating these things,\n because I wish you to consider that an incredible indignation must be the feeling of\n those men from whose cities these things are carried away. \n ",
                "135":"\n And to say nothing of other nations, judge of the Syracusans themselves. For when I\n went to Syracuse , I originally\n believed what I had heard at Rome from that\n man's friends, that the city of Syracuse , on account of the inheritance of Heraclius, was no less\n friendly to him than the city of the Mamertines, because of their participation in\n all his booty and robberies. And at the same time I was afraid that, owing to the\n influence of the high-born and beautiful women at whose will he had directed all the\n measures of his praetorship for three years, and of the men to whom they were\n married, I should be opposed not only by an excessive lenity, but even by a feeling\n of liberality towards that man, if I were to seek for any evidence out of the public\n records of the Syracusans. \n ",
                "136":"\n Therefore when at Syracuse I was\n chiefly with Roman citizens; I copied out their papers; I inquired into their\n injuries. As I was a long time occupied by that business, in order to rest a little\n and to give my mind a respite from care, I returned to those fine documents of\n Carpinatius; in which, in company with some of the most honourable knights of the\n body of Roman settlers, I unraveled the case of those Verrutii, whom I have\n mentioned before, but I expected no aid at all, either publicly or privately, from\n the Syracusans, nor had I any idea of asking for any. While I was doing this, on a\n sudden Heraclius came to me, who was in office at Syracuse , a man of high birth, who had been priest of\n Jupiter , which is the highest honour\n among the Syracusans; he requests of me and of my brother, if we have no objection,\n to go to their senate; that they were at that moment assembled in full numbers in\n the senate-house, and he said that he made this request to us to attend by command\n of the senate. \n ",
                "137":"\n At first we were in doubt what to do; but afterwards it soon occurred to us that we\n ought not to shun that assembly or that place. Therefore we came to the senate-house; they all rise at\n our entry to do us honour. We sat down at the request of the magistrates. Diodorus\n the son of Timarchides, who was the first man in that body both in influence and in\n age, and also as it seemed to me in experience and knowledge of business, began to\n speak; and the first sentence of his speech was to this effect—That the senate and\n people of Syracuse were grieved and\n indignant, that, though in all the other cities of Sicily I had informed the senate and people of what I proposed for\n their advantage or for their safety, and though I had received from them all\n commissions, deputies, letters and evidence, yet in that city I had done nothing of\n that sort. I answered, that deputies from the Syracusans had not been present at\n Rome in that assembly of the Sicilians\n when my assistance was entreated by the common resolution of all the deputations,\n and when the cause of the whole of Sicily was entrusted to me; and that I could not ask that any decree\n should be passed against Caius Verres in that senate-house in which I saw a gilt\n statue of Caius Verres. \n ",
                "138":"\n And after I said that, such a groaning ensued at the sight and mention of the\n statue, that it appeared to have been placed in the senate-house as a monument of\n his wickednesses and not of his services. Then every one for himself, as fast as\n each could manage to speak, began to give me information of those things which I\n have just now mentioned; to tell me that the city was plundered—the temples stripped\n of their treasures—that of the inheritance of Heraclius, which he had adjudged to\n the men of the palaestra, he had taken by far the greatest share himself; and\n indeed, that they could not expect that he should care for the men of the palaestra,\n when he had taken away even the god who was the inventor of oil; that that statue\n had neither been made at the public expense, nor erected by public authority, but\n that those men who had been the sharers in the plunder of the inheritance of\n Heraclius, had had it made and placed where it was; and that those same men had been\n the deputies at Rome , who had been his\n assistants in dishonesty, his partners in his thefts and the witnesses of his\n debaucheries; and that therefore I ought the less to wonder if they were wanting to\n the unanimity of the deputies and to the safety of Sicily . \n ",
                "139":"\n When I perceived that their indignation at that man's injuries was not only not\n less, but almost greater than that of the rest of the Sicilians, then I explained my\n own intentions to them, and my whole plan and system with reference to the whole of\n the business which I had undertaken; then I exhorted them not to be wanting to the\n common cause and the common safety, and to rescind that panegyric which they had\n voted a few days before, being compelled, a, they said, by violence and fear.\n Accordingly, O judges, the Syracusans, that man's clients and friends, do this.\n First of all, they produce to me the public documents which they had carefully\n stored up in the most sacred part of the treasury; in which they show me that\n everything, which I have said had been taken away, was entered, and even more things\n than I was able to mention. And they were entered in this way. “What had been taken\n out of the temple of Minerva .. This,... and that.” “What was missing out of the\n temple of Jupiter .” “What was missing out of\n the temple of Bacchus.” As each individual had had the charge of protecting and\n preserving those things, so it was entered; that each, when according to law he gave\n in his accounts, being bound to give up what he had received, had begged that he\n might be pardoned for the absence of these things and that all had accordingly been\n released from liability on that account, and that it was kept secret; all which\n documents I took care to have sealed up with the public seal and brought away. \n ",
                "140":"\n But concerning the public panegyric on him this explanation was given: that at\n first, when the letters arrived from Verres about the panegyric, a little while\n before my arrival, nothing had been decreed; and after that, when some of his\n friends urged them that it ought to be decreed, they were rejected with the greatest\n outcry and the bitterest reproaches; but when I was on the point of arriving, then\n he who at that time was the chief governor had commanded them to decree it, and that\n it had been decreed in such a manner that the panegyric did him more damage than it\n could have done him good. So now, judges, do you receive the truth of that matter\n from me just as it was shown to me by them. \n ",
                "141":"\n It is a custom at Syracuse , that, if\n a motion on any subject is brought before the senate, whoever wishes, gives his\n opinion on it. No one is asked by name for his sentiments; nevertheless, those are\n accustomed to speak first of their own accord, and naturally, according as they are\n superior in honour or in age; and that precedence is yielded to them by the rest;\n but, if at any time all are silent, then they are compelled to speak by lot. This\n was the custom when the motion was made respecting the panegyric of Verres. On which\n subject at first great numbers speak, in order to delay coming to any vote, and\n interpose this objection, that formerly, when they had heard that there was a\n prosecution instituted against Sextus Peducaeus, who had deserved admirably well of\n that city and of the whole province, and when, in return for his numerous and\n important services, they wished to vote a panegyric on him, they had been prohibited\n from doing so by Caius Verres; and that it would be an unjust thing, although\n Peducaeus had now no need of their praise, still not to vote that which at one time\n they had been eager to vote, before decreeing what they would only decree from\n compulsion. \n ",
                "142":"\n All shout in assent, and say approvingly that that is what ought to be done. So the\n question about Peducaeus is put to the senate. Each man gave his opinion in order,\n according as he had precedence in age and honour. You may learn this from the\n resolution itself; for the opinions delivered by the chief men are generally\n recorded. Read— [The list of speeches made on the subject of Sextus Peducaeus is\n read.] It says who were the chief supporters of the motion. The vote is carried.\n Then the question about Verres is put. Tell me, I pray, what happened. [The list of\n speeches made on the subject of Caius Verres....] Well what comes next? [As no one\n rose, and no one delivered his opinion....] What is this? [They proceed by lot.] Why\n was this? Was no one a willing praiser of your praetorship, or a willing defender of\n you from danger, especially when by being so he might have gained favour with the\n praetor? No one. Those very men who used to feast with you, your advisers and\n accomplices, did not venture to utter a word. In that very senate-house in which a\n statue of yourself and a naked statue of your son were standing, was there no one\n whom even your naked son in a province stripped naked could move to compassion? \n ",
                "143":"\n Moreover they inform me also of this, that they had passed the vote of panegyric in\n such a form that all men might see that it was not a panegyric, but rather a satire,\n to remind every one of his shameful and disastrous praetorship. For in truth it was\n drawn up in these words. “Because he had scourged no one.” From which you are to\n understand, that he had caused most noble and innocent men to be executed. “Because\n he had administered the affairs of the province with vigilance,” when all his vigils\n were well known to have been devoted to debauchery and adultery; moreover, there was\n this clause added, which the defendant could never venture to produce, and the\n accuser would never cease to dwell upon; “Because Verres had kept all pirates at a\n distance from the island of Sicily ;” men\n who in his time had entered even into the “island” of Syracuse . \n ",
                "144":"\n And after I had received this information from them, I departed from the\n senate-house with my brother, in order that they might decree what they chose.\n Immediately they pass a\n decree. First, “That my brother Lucius should be connected with the city by ties of\n hospitably;” because he had shown the same goodwill to the Syracusans that I had\n always felt myself. That they not only wrote at that time, but also had engraved on\n brazen tablets and presented to us. Truly very fond of you are your Syracusans whom\n you are always talking of, who think it quite a sufficient reason for forming an\n intimate connection with your accuser, that he is going to be your accuser, and that\n he has come among them for the purpose of prosecuting inquiries against you. After\n that, a decree is passed, not with any difference of opinion, but almost\n unanimously, “That the panegyric which had been decreed to Caius Verres, be\n rescinded.” \n ",
                "145":"\n But, when not only the vote had been come to, but when it had even been drawn up in\n due form and entered in the records, an appeal is made to the praetor. But who makes\n this appeal? Any magistrate? No. Any senator? Not even that. Any Syracusan? Far from\n it. Who, then, appeals to the praetor? The man who had been Verres's quaestor,\n Caesetius. Oh, the ridiculous business! Oh, the deserted man! O man despaired of and\n abandoned by the Sicilian magistracy! In order to prevent the Sicilians passing a\n resolution of the senate, or from obtaining their rights according to their own\n customs and their own laws, an appeal is made to the praetor, not by any friend of\n his, not by any connection, not, in short, by any Sicilian, but by his own quaestor.\n Who saw this? Who heard it? That just and wise praetor orders the senate to be\n adjourned. A great multitude flocks to me. First of all, the senators cry out that\n their rights are being taken away; that their liberty is being taken away. The\n people praise the senate and thank them. The Roman citizens do not leave me. And on\n that day I had no harder task, than with all my exertions to prevent violent hands\n being laid on the man who made that appeal. \n ",
                "146":"\n When we had gone before the praetor's tribunal, he deliberates, forsooth,\n diligently and carefully what decision he shall give; for, before I say one word, he\n rises from his seat and departs. And so we departed from the forum when it was now\n nearly evening. The next\n day, the first thing in the morning, I beg of him to allow the Syracusans to give me\n a copy of the resolution which they had passed the day before. But he refuses, and\n says that it is a great shame for me to have made a speech in a Greek senate; and\n that, as for my having spoken in the Greek language to Greeks, that was a thing\n which could not be endured at all. I answered the man as I could, as I chose, and as\n I ought. Among other things, I recollect that I said that it was easy to be seen how\n great was the difference between him and the great Numidicus, the real and genuine\n Metellus. That that Metellus had refused to assist with his panegyric Lucius\n Lucullus, his sister's husband, with whom he was on the very best terms, but that he\n was procuring panegyrics from cities for a man totally unconnected with himself, by\n violence and compulsion. \n ",
                "147":"\n But when I understood that it was many recent messengers, and many letters, not of\n introduction but of credit, that had had so much influence over him, at the\n suggestion of the Syracusans themselves I make a seizure of those documents in which\n the resolutions of the senate were recorded. And now behold a fresh confusion and\n strife. That, however, you may not suppose that he was without any friends or\n connections at Syracuse , that he was\n entirely desolate and forsaken, a man of the name of Theomnastus, a man ridiculously\n crazy, whom the Syracusans call Theoractus. attempted to detain those documents; a man in such a condition,\n that the boys follow him, and that every one laughs at him every time he opens his\n mouth. But his craziness, which is ridiculous to others, was then in truth very\n troublesome to me. For while he was foaming at the mouth, his eyes glaring, and he\n crying out as loud as he could that I was attacking him with violence, we came\n together before the tribunal. \n ",
                "148":"\n Then I began to beg to be allowed to seal up and carry away the records. He spoke\n against me; he denied that there had been any regular resolution of the senate\n passed, since an appeal had been made to the praetor. He said that a copy of it\n ought not to be given to me. I read the act, that I was to be allowed all documents\n and records. He, like a crazy man as he was, urged that our laws had nothing to do\n with him. That intelligent praetor decided that he did not choose, as the resolution\n of the senate had no business ever to be ratified, to allow me to take a copy of it\n to Rome . Not to make a long story of it,\n if I had not threatened the man vigorously, if I had not read to him the provisions\n of the act passed in this case, and the penalties enacted by it, I should not have\n been allowed to have the documents. But that crazy fellow, who had declaimed against\n me most violently on behalf of Verres, when he found he did not succeed, in order I\n suppose to recover my favour, gives me a book in which all Verres's Syracusan thefts\n were set down, which I had already been informed of by, and had a list of from them.\n \n ",
                "149":"\n Now, then, let the Mamertines praise you, who are the only men of all that large\n province who wish you to get off, but let them praise you on condition that Heius,\n who is the chief man of that deputation, is present; let them praise you on\n condition that they are here, ready to reply to me on those points concerning which\n they are questioned. And that they may not be taken by surprise on a sudden, this is\n what I shall ask them:—Are they bound to furnish a ship to the Roman people? They\n will admit it. Have they supplied it while Verres was praetor? They will say, No.\n Have they built an enormous transport at the public expense which they have given to\n Verres? They will not be able to deny it. Has Verres taken corn from them to send to\n the Roman people, as his predecessor did? They will say, No. What soldiers or\n sailors have they furnished during those three years? They will say they furnished\n none at all. They will not be able to deny that Messana has been the receiver of all his plunder and all his\n robberies. They will confess that an immense quantity of things were exported from\n that city; and besides that, that this large vessel given to him by the Mamertines,\n departed loaded when the praetor left Sicily . \n ",
                "150":"\n You are welcome, then, to that panegyric of the Mamertines. As for the city of\n Syracuse , we see that that feels\n towards you as it has been treated by you; and among them that infamous Verrean\n festival, instituted by you, has been abolished. In truth, it was a most unseemly\n thing for honours such as belong to the gods to be paid to the man who had carried\n off the images of the gods. In truth, that conduct of the Syracusans would be\n deservedly reproached, If, when they had struck a most celebrated and solemn day of\n festival games out of their annals, because on that day Syracuse was said to have been taken by\n Marcellus, they should, notwithstanding, celebrate a day of festival in the name of\n Verres; though he had plundered the Syracusans of all which that day of disaster had\n left them. But observe the shamelessness and arrogance of the man, O judges, who not\n only instituted this disgraceful and ridiculous Verrean festival out of the money of\n Heraclius, but who also ordered the Marcellean festival to be abolished, in order\n that they might every year offer sacrifices to the man by whose means they had lost\n the sacred festivals which they had ever observed, and had lost their national\n deities, and that they might take away the festival days in honour of that family by\n whose means they had recovered all their other festivals. \n "

                "0":"\n I see, O judges, that it is not doubtful to any one of you that Caius Verres most\n openly plundered everything in Sicily ,\n whether sacred or profane, whether private or public property; and that, not only\n without the slightest scruple, but without even the very least disguise, he\n practiced every possible description of robbery and plunder. But a very heightened\n and pompous defence of him is put forward in reply to me, which I must consider very\n carefully beforehand, O judges, how I am to resist. For his cause is stated in this\n way; that by his valour, and by his singular vigilance exerted at a critical and\n perilous time, the province of Sicily was\n preserved in safety from fugitive slaves, and from the dangers of war. \n ",
                "1":"\n What am I to do, O judges? In what way am I to shape my accusation? which way am I\n to turn? For to all my attacks the appellation of a gallant general is opposed, as a\n wall of defence. I am acquainted with the topic;—I see how Hortensius is going to\n boast himself. He will dilate upon the dangers of the war, the critical time of the\n republic, the scarcity of able generals; and that he will entreat of you, he will\n even claim as a right belonging to himself, that you do not suffer so great a\n general to be taken from the Roman people through the evidence of the Sicilians;\n that you do not allow his glory as a general to be overclouded by accusations of\n avarice. \n ",
                "2":"\n I cannot dissemble my alarm, O judges; I am afraid that Caius Verres, on account of\n this amazing warlike valour of his, may escape with impunity from the consequences\n of all his actions. For it occurs to me, what great influence, what exceeding\n authority, the oration of Marcus Antonius was supposed to have had at the trial of\n Marcus Aquillius; who, as he was not only skillful as an orator, but bold also, when\n he had nearly finished his speech, took hold of Marcus Aquillius and placed him in\n the sight of every one, and tore his robe away from his chest, in order that the\n Roman people and the judges might see his scars, all received in front; and at the\n same time he enlarged a good deal on that wound which he had received on his head\n from the general of the enemy; and worked up the men who were to judge in the cause\n to such a pitch, that they were greatly afraid lest the man whom fortune had saved\n from the weapons of the enemy, and who had not spared himself, should appear to have\n been saved not to receive praise from the Roman people, but to endure the cruelty of\n the judges. Now again this same plan and method of defence is to be tried by the\n opposite party. \n ",
                "3":"\n The same object is aimed at. He may be a thief, he may be a robber of temples, he\n may he the very chief man in every sort of vice and criminality; but he is a gallant\n general and a fortunate one, and he must be preserved for the critical emergencies\n of the republic. \n \n I will not plead against you\n according to strict law; I will not urge that point, which perhaps I ought to carry\n if I did, that as this trial is appointed to take place according to a particular\n formula, the point that required to be proved by you, is not what gallant exploits\n you may have performed in war, but how you have kept your hands from other people's\n money,—I will not, I say, urge this; but I will ask, as I perceive you are desirous\n that I should, what has been your conduct and what have been your great exploits in\n war. \n ",
                "4":"\n What will you say? That in the war of the runaway slaves Sicily was delivered by your valour? It is a great\n praise; a very honourable boast. But in what war? For we have understood that after\n that war which Marcus Aquillius finished, there has been no war of fugitive slaves\n in Sicily . Oh! but there was in Italy . I admit that; a great and formidable war. Do\n you then attempt to claim for yourself any part of the credit arising from that war?\n Do you think that you are to share any of the glory of that victory with Marcus\n Crassus or Cnaeus Pompeius? I do not suppose that even this will be too great a\n stretch for your impudence, to venture to say something of that sort. You, forsooth,\n hindered any part of the forces of these slaves from passing over from Italy into Sicily ? Where? When? From what part of Italy , as they never attempted to approach Sicily in any ships or vessels of any sort? For we\n never heard anything whatever of such an attempt; but we have heard that care was\n taken, by the courage and prudence of Marcus Crassus, that most valiant man, that\n the runaways should not make boats so as to be able to cross the strait to\n Messana ; an attempt from which it would\n not have been so important to have cut them off, if there were supposed to have been\n any forces in Sicily able to oppose their\n invasion. \n ",
                "5":"\n But though there was war in Italy so close\n to Sicily , still it never came into\n Sicily . Where is the wonder? for when it\n existed in Sicily , at exactly the same\n distance from Italy , no part of it reached\n Italy . \n \n \n\n What has the proximity of the countries to do with either side of the argument in\n discussing this topic? Will you say that access was very easy to the enemy, or that\n the contagion and temptation of imitating that war was a dangerous one? Every access\n to the island was not only difficult to, but was entirely cut off from men who had\n no ships; so that it was more easy for those men, to whom you say that Sicily was so near, to go to the shore of the ocean\n than to Cape Pelorus. \n ",
                "6":"\n But as for the contagious nature to that servile war, why is it spoken of by you\n more than by all the rest of the officers who were governors of the other provinces?\n Is it because before that time there had been wars of runaway slaves in Sicily ? But that is the very cause why that province\n is now and has been in the least danger. For ever since Marcus Aquillius left it all\n the regulations and edicts of the praetors have been to this effect, that no slave\n should ever be seen with a weapon. What I am going to mention is an old story, and\n one, probably, owing to the severity of the example, not unknown to any one of you.\n They tell a story that Lucius Domitius was praetor in Sicily , and that an immense boar was brought to him; that he,\n marveling at the size of the beast, asked who had killed it. When he was told that\n it was such-an-one's shepherd, he ordered him to be summoned before him; that the\n shepherd came eagerly to the praetor, expecting praise and reward; that Domitius\n asked him how he had slain so huge a beast; that he answered “With a hunting spear;”\n and that he was instantly crucified by order of the praetor. This may, perhaps,\n appear harsh: I say nothing either way; all that I understand from the story is,\n that Domitius preferred to appear cruel in punishing, to seeming negligent in\n overlooking offences. \n ",
                "7":"\n Therefore, while these were the established regulations of the province, Caius\n Norbanus, a man neither very active nor very valiant, was at perfect ease, at the\n very moment that all Italy was raging with\n the servile war. For at that time Sicily \n easily took care of itself, so that no war could possibly arise there. In truth, as\n no two things are so closely united as the traders are with the Sicilians, by habit,\n by interest, by reason, and by community of sentiment; and as the Sicilians have all\n their affairs in such a state that it is most desirable for them to be at peace; and\n as they are so attached to the sway of the Roman people that they would be very\n sorry that its power should be diminished or altered; and as ever since the servile\n war all such dangers as these have been provided for, both by the regulations of the\n praetors, and by the discipline of the masters; there is no conceivable domestic\n evil which can arise out of the province itself. \n ",
                "8":"\n What then do you say? Were there no disturbances of slaves in Sicily while Verres was praetor? Are no conspiracies\n said to have taken place? None at all that have ever come to the knowledge of the\n senate and people of Rome ; none which that\n man has thought worth writing public despatches to Rome about; and yet I do suspect that the body of slaves had begun to\n be less orderly in some parts of Sicily ;\n and I infer that, not so much from any overt act, as from the actions and decrees of\n Verres. And see with how little of a hostile feeling I am going to conduct this\n case. I myself will mention and bring forward the things which he wishes to have\n mentioned, and which as yet you have never heard of. \n ",
                "9":"\n In the district of Triocala, a place which the fugitive slaves had occupied before,\n the family of a certain Sicilian called Leonidas was implicated in suspicion of a\n conspiracy. Information of the matter was laid before Verres. Immediately, as was\n natural, by his command, the men who had been named were arrested and taken to\n Lilybaeum . Their master was summoned to\n appear, and after the case had been heard they were condemned. \n \n \n What happened afterwards? What do you suppose? Perhaps you expect\n to hear of some robbery or plunder;—do not look on all occasions for the same\n things—when a man is in fear of war, what room is there for petty thefts? However,\n even if there was any opportunity for such a thing in this matter, it was\n overlooked. Perhaps he could have got some money out of Leonidas when he summoned\n him to appear. There was besides room for bargaining, (and that was an opportunity\n that he was not new to,) to get the cause adjourned; and a second chance, to get the\n slaves acquitted. But when the slaves had been condemned, what opportunity of\n plundering could there be? They must be brought up for punishment. For there were\n the witnesses who were sitting on the bench; the public records were witnesses; that\n most splendid city of Lilybaeum was a\n witness; that most honourable and numerous assembly of Roman citizens was a witness.\n Nothing can be done; they must be brought up. Accordingly, they are brought up, and\n fastened to the stake. \n ",
                "10":"\n Even now, O judges, you seem to me to be waiting to see what happened next; because\n that man never did anything without some gain and some booty. What could be done in\n such a case? What is profitable? Expect then to hear of some crime as infamous as\n you please; but I will outdo all your expectation. The men who had been convicted of\n wickedness and conspiracy, who had been delivered up for punishment, who had been\n bound to the stake, on a sudden, in the sight of many thousands of men, are unbound\n and restored to Leonidas their master. What can you say on this topic, O most insane\n of men? except, indeed, that which I do not ask you; what, in short, in so nefarious\n a business, although there can be no doubt about it, still, even if there were a\n doubt, ought not to be asked; namely, what or how much money you took to release\n them, and how you managed it. I give up the whole of this to you; and I release you\n from this anxiety; for I am not afraid of any one believing that you, without any\n payment, undertook an action which no man in the world except you could have been\n induced to undertake by any sum of money whatever. But about that system of thieving\n and plundering of yours I say nothing;—what I am now discussing is your renown as a\n general. \n ",

Did you\n dare to snatch from the very jaws of death and to release slaves whom you had\n decided were eager to take arms and to make war in Sicily , and whom in accordance with the opinion of your colleagues on\n the bench you had sentenced, after they had been already delivered up to punishment\n after the manner of our ancestors and had been bound to the stake, in order to\n reserve for Roman citizens the cross which you had erected for condemned slaves?\n Ruined cities, when their affairs are all desperate, are often accustomed to these\n disastrous scenes, to have those who have been condemned restored to their original\n position; those who have been bound, released; those who have been banished,\n restored; decisions which have been given, rescinded. And when such events take\n place, there is no one who is not aware that that state is hastening to its fall.\n When such things take place, there is no one who thinks that there is any hope of\n safety left. \n ",
                "12":"\n And whenever these things do take place, their effect has been to cause popular or\n high-born men to be relieved from punishment or exile; still, not by the very men\n who have passed the sentences; still, not instantly; still, not if they have been\n convicted of those crimes which affected the lives and property of all the citizens.\n Still this is an utterly unprecedented step, and of such a character as to appear\n credible rather from consideration of who the criminal is, than from consideration\n of the case itself That a man should have released slaves; that that very man who\n had sentenced them should release them; that he should release them, in a moment,\n out of the very jaws of death, that he should release slaves convicted of a crime\n which affected the life and existence of every free man— \n ",
                "13":"\n O splendid general, not to be compared now to Marcus Aquillius, a most valiant man,\n but to the Paulli, the Scipios, and the Marii! That a man should have had such\n foresight at a time of such alarm and danger to the province! As he saw that the\n minds of all the slaves in Sicily were in\n an unsettled state on account of the war of the runaway slaves in Italy , what was the great terror he struck into them\n to prevent any one's daring to stir? He ordered them to be arrested—who would not he\n alarmed? He ordered their masters to plead their cause—what could be so terrible to\n slaves? He pronounced “That they appeared to have done....” He seems to have\n extinguished the rising flame by the pain and death of a few. What follows next?\n Scourgings, and burnings, and all those extreme agonies which are part of the\n punishment of condemned criminals, and which strike terror into the rest, torture\n and the cross? From all these punishments they are released. Who can doubt that he\n must have overwhelmed the minds of the slaves with the most abject fear, when they\n saw a praetor so good-natured as to allow the lives of men condemned of wickedness\n and conspiracy to be redeemed from punishment, the very executioner acting as the\n go-between to negotiate the terms? \n ",

When at your\n instigation the steward of Eumenides of Halicya, a highborn and honourable man of\n great wealth, was accused of some crime, you got sixty thousand sesterces from his master, and he lately explained to us,\n as a witness on his oath, how you managed it. From Caius Matrinius, a Roman knight,\n you took in his absence, while he was at Rome , a hundred thousand sesterces ,\n because you said that his stewards and shepherds had fallen under suspicion. Lucius\n Flavius, the agent of Caius Matrinius, who paid you that money, deposed to this\n fact; Caius Matrinius himself made the same statement, and that most illustrious\n man, Cnaeus Lentulus the censor, who quite recently has both sent letters to you\n himself, and has procured others to be sent to you for the purpose of doing honour\n to Caius Matrinius, will prove the same thing. \n ",

This man Verres, as\n soon as he came to Panormus , ordered\n to be summoned before him, and to be cited before his tribunal, in the presence of a\n great number of the Roman settlers in that city. Men immediately began to talk; to\n wonder how it was that Apollonius, a wealthy man, had so long remained free from his\n attacks. “He has devised some plan; he has brought some charge against him; a rich\n man is not summoned in a hurry by Verres without some object.” All are in the\n greatest state of anxiety to see what is to happen, when on a sudden Apollonius\n himself runs up, out of breath, with his young son; for his father, a very old man,\n had been for some time confined to his bed. \n ",

Verres orders the man\n to be hurried from the tribunal, and to be cast into prison. He began to cry out,\n while he was being hurried off, that the, unhappy man that he was, had done nothing;\n had committed no offence; that his money was all out at loan, that ready money he\n had none. While he kept making these declarations in a very numerous assembly of\n people, so that every one could understand that he was treated with this bitter\n injustice and violence because he had not given Verres money,—while, I say, he kept\n making these statements about his money at the top of his voice, he was thrown into\n prison. \n ",

I will omit\n all these statements; though, were I to choose to follow them up, I could easily\n show by your cruelty towards others, that every channel of mercy from the judges to\n yourself has been long since blocked up. \n ",
                "21":"\n All those topics I will abandon, I will spare you them. For I know beforehand what\n Hortensius will say in your defence. He will confess that with Verres neither the\n old age of Apollonius's father, nor the youth of his son, nor the tears of both, had\n more influence than the advantage and safety of the republic. He will say that the\n affairs of the republic cannot be administered without terror and severity; he will\n ask why the fasces are borne before the praetors,\n why the axes are given to them, why prisons have been built, why so many punishments\n have been established against the wicked by the usage of our ancestors. And when he\n has said all this with becoming gravity and sternness, I will ask him why Verres all\n of a sudden ordered this same Apollonius to be released from prison, without any\n fresh circumstances having been brought to light, without any defence having been\n made, or any trial having taken place? And I will affirm that there is so much\n suspicion attached to this charge, that, without any arguments of mine, I will allow\n the judges to form their own opinion as to what a system of plundering this was, how\n infamous, how scandalous, and what an immense and boundless field it opens for\n inordinate gain. \n ",
                "22":"\n For first of all consider for a moment how many and how grievous were the evils\n which that man inflicted on Apollonius; and then calculate them and estimate them by\n money. You will find that they were all so continued in the case of this one wealthy\n man, as by their example to cause a fear of similar suffering and danger to all\n others. In the first place, there was a sudden accusation of a capital and\n detestable crime; judge what you think this worth, and how many have bought\n themselves off from such charges. In the next place, there is an accusation without\n an accuser, a sentence without any bench of judges, a condemnation without any\n defence having been made. Estimate the money to be got by all these transactions,\n and then suppose that Apollonius alone was an actual victim to these atrocities, but\n that all the rest, as many as they were, delivered themselves from these sufferings\n by money. Lastly, there were darkness, chains, imprisonment, punishment within the\n prison, seclusion from the sight of his parents and of his children, a denial of the\n free air and common light of heaven; but these things, which a man might freely give\n his life to escape, I am unable to estimate by the standard of money. \n ",
                "23":"\n From all these things did Apollonius after a long time ransom himself, when he was\n worn out with suffering and misery; but still he taught the rest to meet that man's\n wickedness and avarice beforehand. Unless you think that a wealthy man was selected\n for so incredible an accusation without any object of gain; or that, again, he was\n on a sudden released from prison without any corresponding reason; or that this\n method of plundering was used and tried in the case of that man alone, and that\n terror was not, by means of his example, held out to and struck into every rich man\n in Sicily . \n ",
                "24":"\n I wish, O judges, to be prompted by him, since I am speaking of his military\n renown, if by accident I pass over anything. For I seem to myself to have spoken of\n all his exploits which are connected with his suspicion of a servile war; at all\n events I have not omitted anything intentionally. You are in possession of the man's\n wisdom, and diligence, and vigilance; and of his guardianship and defence of the\n province. The main thing is, as there are many classes of generals, for you to know\n to what class he belongs. But that, in the present dearth of brave men, you may not\n be ignorant of such a commander as he is, know,—I beg you, O judges, to be aware,\n that his is not the wisdom of Quintus Maximus, nor the promptness of action\n belonging to that great man the elder Africanus, nor the singular prudence of the\n Africanus of later times, nor the method and discipline of Paulus Aemilius, nor the\n vigour and courage of Caius Marcus; but that he is to be esteemed and taken care of\n as belonging to quite a different class of generals. \n ",
                "25":"\n In the first place, see how easy and pleasant to himself Verres by his own\n ingenuity and wisdom made the labour of marches, which is a labour of the greatest\n importance in all military affairs, and most especially necessary in Sicily . First, in the winter season he devises for\n himself this admirable remedy against the severity of the cold and the violence of\n storms and floods; he selected the city of Syracuse , the situation of which and the nature of its soil and\n atmosphere are said to be such that there never yet was a day of such violent and\n turbulent storms, that men could not see the sun at some time or other in the day.\n Here that gallant general was quartered in the winter months, so securely that it\n was not easy to see him, I will not say out of the house, but even out of bed. So\n the shortness of the day was consumed in banquets, the length of the night in\n adulteries and debaucheries. \n ",
                "26":"\n But when it began to be spring, the beginning of which he was not used to date from\n the west wind, or from any star, but he thought that spring was beginning when he\n had seen the rose, then he devoted himself to labour and to marches; and in these he\n proved himself so patient and active that no one ever once saw him sitting on a\n horse. \n \n For, as was the custom of the kings of\n Bithynia , he was borne on a litter\n carried by eight men, in which was a cushion, very beautiful, of Melitan\n manufacture, stuffed with roses. And he himself had one chaplet on his head, another\n on his neck, and kept putting a network bag to his nose, made of the finest thread,\n with minute interstices, full of roses. Having performed his march in this manner,\n when he came to any town he was carried in the same litter up to his chamber.\n Thither came the magistrates of the Sicilians, thither came the Roman knights, as\n you have heard many of them state on their oaths; there disputes were secretly\n communicated to him; and from thence, a little while afterwards, decrees were openly\n brought down. Then, when for a while he had dispensed the laws for bribery, and not\n out of considerations of justice, he thought that now the rest of his time was due\n to Venus and to Bacchus. \n ",
                "27":"\n And when speaking of this, I must not omit the admirable and singular diligence of\n this great general. For know that there is no town in all Sicily of those in which the praetors are accustomed\n to stay and hold their court, in which there was not some woman selected for him out\n of some respectable family, to gratify his lust. Some of them were even openly\n present at his banquets. If there were some a little modest, they used to come at\n the proper time, and avoided the light of day, and the crowd. And these banquets\n were celebrated, not with the orderly silence of the banquets of praetors and\n generals of the Roman people, nor with that modesty which is usually found at the\n entertainments of magistrates, but with the most excessive noise and licence of\n conversation sometimes even affairs proceeded to blows and fighting. For that strict\n and diligent praetor, who had never obeyed the laws of the Roman people, observed\n most carefully those rules which are laid down for drinking parties. And accordingly\n the ends of these banquets were such that men were often carried out from the feast\n as from a battle; others were left on the ground as dead; numbers lay prostrate\n without sense or feeling, so that any one who beheld the scene would have supposed\n that he was looking not on a banquet of a praetor, but on the battle of Cannae . \n ",
                "28":"\n But when the middle of summer began to be felt, the time that all the praetors in\n Sicily have been accustomed to devote to\n their journeys, because they think that the best time for travelling over the\n province where the corn is on the threshing-floor, because at that time all the\n members of a household are collected together, and the number of a person's slaves\n is seen, and the work that is done is most easily observed; the abundance of the\n harvest invites travel and the season of the year is no obstacle to it; then, I say,\n when all other praetors are used to travel about, that general of a new sort pitched\n himself a permanent camp in the most beautiful spot in Syracuse . \n ",
                "29":"\n For at the very entrance and mouth of the harbour, where first the bay begins to\n curve from the shore of the open sea towards the city, he pitched tents of fine\n linen curtains; thither he migrated from the praetorian palace which had belonged to\n king Hiero, and lived here so that during the whole summer no one ever saw him out\n of his tent. And to that tent no one had access unless he was either a boon\n companion, or a minister of his lust. Hither came all the women with whom he had any\n intrigue, and of these it is incredible how great a number there was at Syracuse . Hither came men worthy of that man's\n friendship, worthy associates in that course of life also those banquets. Among such\n men and such women as these, his son, now grown up, spent his time; in order that if\n nature removed him at all from the likeness to his father, still use and constant\n training might make him resemble him. \n ",
                "30":"\n That Tertia whom I have spoken of before, having been tempted by trick and artifice\n to leave her Rhodian flute-player and to come hither, is reported to have caused\n great disturbance in that camp; as the wife of Cleomenes the Syracusan, a woman of\n noble birth, and the wife of Aeschrio, a woman of very respectable patronage, were\n very indignant that the daughter of Isidorus the buffoon should be admitted into\n their company. But that Hannibal, who thought that in his army there ought to be no\n rivalry of birth, but only of merit, was so much in love with this Tertia, that he\n carried her with him out of the province. \n \n And all\n that time, while that man, clad in a purple cloak and a tunic reaching to his\n ankles, was reveling in banquets with women, men were not offended, nor in the least\n vexed that the magistrate was absent from the forum that the laws were not\n administered, that the courts of justice were not held; that all that shore\n resounded with women's vices, and music and songs. They were not, I say, at all\n vexed at there being a total silence in the forum, no pleading, and no law. For it\n was not law or the court of justice that seemed to be absent from the forum, but\n violence and cruelty, and the bitter and shameful robbery of good men. \n ",
                "31":"\n Do you then, O Hortensius, defend this man on the ground of his having been a\n general? Do you endeavour to conceal his thefts, his rapine, his cupidity, his\n cruelty, his pride, his wickedness, his audacity, by dwelling on the greatness of\n his exploits and his renown as a commander? No doubt I have cause to fear here, that\n at the end of your defence you may have recourse to the old conduct of Antonius, and\n to his mode of ending a speech; that Verres may be brought forward, his breast\n bared, that the Roman people may see his scars, inflicted by the bites of women,\n traces of lust and profligacy. \n ",
                "32":"\n May the gods grant that you may venture to make mention of military affairs and of\n war. For all his ancient military service shall be made known, in order that you may\n be aware, not only what he has been as a commander, but also how he behaved as a\n soldier in his campaigns. That first campaign of his shall be brought up again, in\n which he was, as he says himself, subservient to others, not their master. The camp\n of that gambler of Placentia shall be\n brought: up again, where, though he were assiduous in his attendance, he still lost\n his pay. Many of his losses in his campaigns shall be recounted, which were made up\n for and retrieved by the most infamous expedients. \n ",
                "33":"\n But afterwards, when he had become hardened by a long course of such infamy,—when\n he had sated others, not himself,—why need I relate what sort of man he turned out?\n what carefully guarded defences of modesty and chastity he broke down by violence\n and audacity? or why should I connect the disgrace of an, one else with his\n profligacy? I will not do so, O judges. I will pass over all old stories; I will\n only mention two recent achievements of his, without fixing infamy on any one else;\n and by those you will be able to conjecture the rest. One of them is, that it was so\n notorious to every one, that during the consulship of Lucius Lucullus and Marcus\n Cotta, no one ever came up from any municipal town to Rome on any law business, who was so ill-informed of what was going\n on as not to know that all the laws of the Roman people were regulated by the will\n and pleasure of Chelidon the prostitute. The other is that, after he had left the\n city in the robe of war,—after he had pronounced the solemn vows for the success of\n his administration, and for the common welfare of the republic, he was accustomed,\n for the sake of committing adultery, to be brought back into the city, at night, in\n a litter, to a woman who, though the wife of one man, was common to all men,\n contrary to law, contrary to what was required by the auspices, contrary to\n everything which is held sacred among gods and men. \n ",
                "34":"\n O ye immortal gods! what a difference is there between the minds and ideas of men!\n So may your good opinion and that of the Roman people approve of my intentions, and\n sanction my hopes for the rest of my life, as I have received those offices with\n which the Roman people has as yet entrusted me with the feeling that I was bound to\n a conscientious discharge of every possible duty. I was appointed quaestor with the\n feeling that that honour was not given to me so much as lent and entrusted to me. I\n obtained the quaestorship in the province of Sicily , and considered that every man's eyes were turned upon me\n alone. So that I thought that I and my quaestorship were being exhibited on some\n theatre open to the whole world; so that I denied myself all those things which seem\n to be indulgences, not merely to those irregular passions, but even those which are\n coveted by nature itself and by necessity. \n ",
                "35":"\n Now I am aedile elect, I consider what it is that I have received from the Roman\n people; I consider that I am bound to celebrate holy games with the most solemn\n ceremonies to Ceres , to Bacchus, and to\n Libera; that I am bound to render Flora propitious to the Roman nation and people by\n the splendour of her games; that it is my office to celebrate those most ancient\n games, which were the first that were ever called Roman games, with the greatest\n dignity and with all possible religious observance, in honour of Juno,\n Jupiter , and Minerva; that the charge of\n protecting all the sacred buildings and the whole city is entrusted to me; that as a\n recompense for all that labour and anxiety these honours are granted to me,—an\n honourable precedence in delivering my opinion in the senate; a toga praetexta ; a curule chair; a right of transmitting my\n image to the recollection of my posterity. \n ",
                "36":"\n I wish, O judges, that all the gods may be propitious to me, as I do not receive by\n any means so much pleasure from all these things, (though the honours conferred on\n me by the people are most acceptable to me,) as I feel anxiety, and as I will take\n pains, that this aedileship may not seem to have been given to some one of the\n candidates, because it could not be helped, but to have been conferred on me because\n it was proper that it should be, and to have been conferred by the deliberate\n judgment of the people. \n ",
                "37":"\n You, when you were appointed praetor, by whatever means it was brought about,—for I\n leave out and pass over everything that was done at that time,—but when you were\n appointed, as I have said, were you not roused by the very voice of the crier, who\n made such frequent announcements that you had been invested with that honour by the\n centimes of the seniors and juniors, to think that some part of the republic had\n been entrusted to you? that for that one year you must do without the house of a\n prostitute? When it fell to you by lot to preside in the court of justice, did you\n never consider what an important affair, what a burden you had imposed on you? Did\n it never once occur to you, if by any chance you were able to awaken yourself, that\n that province, which it was difficult for a man to administer properly even if\n endowed with the greatest wisdom and the greatest integrity, had fallen to the lot\n of the greatest stupidity and worthlessness? Therefore, you were not only unwilling\n to drive Chelidon from your house during your praetorship, but you even transported\n your whole praetorship to Chelidon's house. \n ",
                "38":"\n The province followed; in which it never occurred to you that the fasces and axes, and such absolute authority, and such\n dignity, and every sort of decoration, was not given to you in order, by the power\n and authority derived from these things, to break down all the barriers of law and\n modesty and duty, and to consider every man's property as your own booty; so that no\n man's estate could be safe, no man's house closed; no man's life protected, no\n woman's chastity fortified, against your cupidity and audacity; in which you behaved\n yourself in such a way that, being detected in everything, you take refuge in an\n imaginary war of runaway slaves; by which you now perceive, that not only no defence\n is procured for you, but that an immense body of accusations is raised up against\n you; unless, indeed, you are going to speak of the relics of the war in Italy , and the disaster of Temsa. But when your\n fortune recently conducted you to that place, at a most seasonable time, if you had\n any courage, or any energy, you were found to be the same man that you had ever\n been. \n ",
                "39":"\n When the men of Valentia had come to you,\n and when a noble and an eloquent man, Marcus Marius, was addressing you on their\n behalf, begging you to undertake the business, and, as the power and the name of\n praetor belonged to you, to act as their chief and leader in extinguishing that\n small band that was at Temsa, you not only shunned that task, but at that very time,\n while you were on the shore, that dear Tertia of yours, whom you were carrying with\n you, was there in the sight of all men. And to the deputies from Valentia , such an illustrious and noble\n municipality, you gave no answer at all in matters of such moment, while you were\n still in your dark-coloured tunic and cloak. What can you, O judges, suppose that\n this man did while on his journey? what can you suppose he did in the province\n itself who, when he was on his way from his province, not to celebrate a triumph,\n but to be put on his trial, did not avoid a scandal which could not have been\n accompanied by any pleasure. \n ",
                "40":"\n Oh! the noble murmur of the crowd in the temple of Bellona! You recollect, O\n judges, when it was getting towards evening, and when mention had been made a short\n time before of this disaster at Temsa, when no one was found who could be sent into\n those districts with a military command, that some one said that Verres was not far\n from Temsa. You recollect how universally every one murmured; how openly the chief\n men repudiated the suggestion. And does the man who has been convicted of so many\n accusations by so many witnesses, now place any hope in the votes of those judges,\n who have already openly condemned him, even before his cause was heard? \n ",
                "41":"\n Be it so. He has gained no credit either from any war of the runaway slaves, or\n from the suspicion of such a war; because there has neither been any such war, nor\n danger of any such war in Sicily ; nor were\n any precautions taken by him to prevent such a war. But, at all events, against any\n war of pirates he had a fleet well equipped, and he exhibited extraordinary energy\n in that matter. And therefore, while he was praetor, the province was admirably\n defended. I will speak of the war with the pirates, and of the Sicilian fleet, when\n I have first of all solemnly stated, that with respect to this matter alone, he\n committed all his most enormous crimes,—crimes of avarice, of treason, of insanity,\n of lust and of cruelty. I beg of you to give your most diligent attention, as you\n have hitherto given it, while I briefly detail the events that took place. \n ",
                "42":"\n In the first place, I say, that the naval affairs were managed, not with the view\n of defending the province, but of acquiring money under presence of providing a\n fleet. Though this had been the custom of former praetors, to impose a contribution\n of ships and of a fixed number of sailors and soldiers on each city, yet you imposed\n no contribution on the very important and wealthy city of the Mamertines. What money\n the Mamertines gave you secretly for that indulgence, will be seen hereafter; we\n will ascertain that from their own letters and witnesses. \n ",
                "43":"\n But I assert, that a merchant vessel of the largest size, like a trireme, very\n beautiful, and highly ornamented, was openly built at the public expense, with the\n knowledge of all Sicily , and given and\n presented to you by the magistrates and senate of the Mamertines. This ship, laden\n with Sicilian booty, itself being also a part of that booty, put into Velia , at the same time that he himself left the\n province laden with many articles, and especially with such as he did not like to\n send to Rome along with the rest of the\n fruits of his robberies before he arrived himself, because they were the most\n valuable, and those which he was most fond of. I myself have lately seen that vessel\n at Velia , O judges, and many other men\n have seen it too; a very beautiful and highly ornamented ship, which, indeed, seemed\n to all who beheld her, to be now looking for the banishment, and to be waiting for\n the departure of her owner. \n ",
                "44":"\n What answer will you make to me now? Unless, perhaps, you say what, although it\n cannot possibly be admitted as an excuse, yet must be urged in a trial for\n extortion, that that ship was built with your own money. Dare, at least, to say this\n which is necessary. Do not be afraid, O Hortensius, of my asking how it became\n lawful for a senator to build a ship? Those are old and dead laws, as you are\n accustomed to call them, which forbid it. There was such a republic here, once, O\n judges; there was such strictness in the tribunals, that an accuser would have\n thought such a transaction worthy to be classed among the most serious crimes. For\n what did you want of a ship? when, if you were going anywhere on account of the\n state, ships were provided for you at the public expense, both to convey you, and to\n guard you? But it is not possible for you to go anywhere on your own private\n account, nor to send for articles across the sea from those countries in which it is\n not lawful for you to have any possessions, or any dealings. \n ",
                "45":"\n Then, why have you prepared anything contrary to the laws? This charge would have\n had weight in the ancient severity and dignity of the republic. Now, I not only do\n not accuse you on account of this offence, but I do not even reprove you with an\n ordinary reprimand. Lastly, did you never think that this would be discreditable to\n you? did you never think it would be ground for an accusation, or cause for\n unpopularity, to have a transport openly built for you, in a most frequented place\n in that province in which you had the supreme command? What did you suppose that\n they said who saw it? What did you suppose that they thought who heard of it? Did\n they think that you were going to take that vessel to Italy , empty? that you were going to let it out as a sailing boat,\n when you got to Rome ? No one would even\n believe that you had in Italy any farm on\n the coast, and that you were preparing a merchant vessel for the purpose of moving\n your crops. Did you wish every man's conversation to be such as for men to say\n openly that you were preparing that ship to carry all your plunder from Sicily , and to go to and fro for the booty which you\n had left behind? \n ",
                "46":"\n But, however, I give up and grant the whole of this, if you say that the vessel was\n built with your money. But, O most demented of men, are you not aware that this\n ground was cut from under your feet by those very friends of yours, the Mamertines\n themselves, in the previous pleading? For Heius, the chief man of the city,—the\n chief man of that deputation which was sent to utter a panegyric on you, said that\n the ship had been built for you by the public labour of the Mamertines, and that a\n Mamertine Senator had been appointed by public authority to superintend the building\n of it. The only thing that remains is the materials. And this you yourself compelled\n the Rhegians to furnish at the public expense, as they say themselves (not that you\n can deny it), because the Mamertines have no proper materials. \n \n \n If both the materials of which the vessel is built, and if those\n who built it, were provided by your authority, not at your expense, what, then, is\n the secret thing which you say was paid for with your money? Oh! but the Mamertines\n have no enemies respecting it in their public accounts. \n ",
                "47":"\n In the first place, I can understand that it may be possible that they did not\n disburse any money out of the treasury. In fact, even the Capitol, as it was built\n in the time of our ancestors, was able to be built and completed by public\n authority, but without any public payment, workmen being pressed into the service,\n and a fair quota of work being exacted from each person respectively. In the next\n place, I see this also, (which I will prove when I produce my witnesses, from the\n accounts of the Mamertines themselves,) that a great deal of money was spent by that\n man which was entered as paid for imaginary contracts for works that never existed.\n For it is not at all strange that the Mamertines should in their accounts have shown\n a regard for that man's safety, from whom they had received the greatest benefits,\n and whom they had known to be much more friendly to them than he was to the Roman\n people. But if it is any argument that the Mamertines did not give you money,\n because they have not got it down in their accounts, let it be an argument also that\n the ship cost you nothing, because you have no entry to produce of having bought it,\n or having made a contract with any one to build it for you. \n ",
                "48":"\n Oh! but you did not command the Mamertines to furnish a ship, because they are one\n of the confederate cities. Thank God, we have a man trained by the hands of the\n Fetiales; a man above all others pious\n and careful in all that belongs to public religion. Let all the men who have been\n praetors before you be given up to the Mamertines, because they have commanded them\n to furnish ships contrary to the provisions of the treaty. But still you, O you\n pious and scrupulous man, how was it that you commanded the people of Tauromenium , which is also a confederate\n city, to furnish a ship? Will you make any one believe that, while the case of both\n the states was exactly the same, the law that you administered, and the condition in\n which you left each, was so different, without money being the cause of the\n difference? \n ",
                "49":"\n What, if I prove, O judges, that these two treaties with the two states were of\n such a nature, that in the case of the people of Tauromenium it was expressly provided for\n and guarded against in the treaty, “that they were not bound to furnish a vessel;”\n but that in the case of the Mamertines it was set down and written in the treaty\n itself, “that they were bound to furnish a vessel;” but that Verres, in opposition\n to both treaties, compelled the Tauromenians to furnish one, and excused the\n Mamertines? Can it, then, be doubtful to any one that, while Verres was praetor,\n that merchant-vessel was a greater assistance to the Mamertines than the treaty was\n to the Tauromenians? Let the treaties be read. [The treaties of the Mamertines and\n the Tauromenians with the Roman people are read.] \n \n\n By that act therefore, of kindness, as you call it—of corruption and dishonesty, as\n the case itself proves,—you detracted from the majesty of the republic, you\n diminished the reinforcements of the Roman people—you diminished their resources,\n acquired by the valour and wisdom of their ancestors; you destroyed their imperial\n rights, and the terms on which the allies became such, and all recollection of the\n treaty. They who by the express words of the treaty were bound to send at their own\n expense and risk a ship properly armed and equipped with everything necessary, even\n as far as the ocean if we ordered them to do so, those men bought from you for money\n a release from the terms of the treaty, and a release from the lights of sovereignty\n which we had over them, so as to be excused from even sailing in that narrow sea\n before their own houses and homes, from defending their own walls and harbours. \n ",
                "50":"\n How much labour, and trouble, and money, do you suppose the Mamertines at the time\n of making this treaty would willingly have devoted to the object of preventing this\n bireme from being mentioned in it, if they could by any possibility have obtained\n such a favour from our ancestors? For when this heavy burden was imposed on the\n city, there was contained somehow or other in that treaty of alliance some badge, as\n it were, of slavery. That which then, when their services were recent, before the\n matter was finally determined, when the Roman people were in no difficulties, they\n could not obtain by treaty from our ancestors; that now, when they have done us no\n new service, after so many years,—now that it has been enforced every year by our\n right of sovereignty, and has been invariably observed—now, I say, when we are in\n great want of vessels, they have obtained from Caius Verres by bribery. Oh! but this\n is all that they have gained, exemption from furnishing a ship! Have the Mamertines\n for the last three years furnished one sailor, one soldier, to serve either in fleet\n or in garrison, all the time you have been praetor? \n ",
                "51":"\n Lastly, when according to the resolution of the senate, and also according to the\n Terentian and Cassian law, corn was to be bought in equal proportions from all the\n cities of Sicily , from that light burden\n also, which they shared too with all the other cities, you relieved the\n Mamertines.—You will say that the Mamertines do not owe corn. How do not owe corn?\n Do you mean to say they were not bound to sell us corn? For this corn was not a\n contribution to be exacted, but a supply to be purchased. By your permission, then,\n by your interpretation of the treaty, the Mamertines were not bound to assist the\n Roman people, even by supplying their markets, and furnishing them with provisions.\n \n ",
                "52":"\n And what city, then, was bound to supply these things? As for those who cultivate\n the public domains, it is settled what they are bound to furnish by the Censorian\n Law. Why did you exact from them anything besides that in another class of\n contribution? What? Do those who are liable to the payment of tenths owe anything\n more than a single tenth, according to the Law of Hiero? Why have you fixed in their\n case also how much corn they were to be bound to sell to us, that being another\n description of contribution? Those who are exempt undoubtedly owe nothing. But you\n not only exacted this from them, but even by way of making them give more than they\n possibly could, you added to their burden those sixty thousand modii from which you excused the Mamertines. And this is\n not what I say, that this was not rightly exacted from the others; what I say is,\n that it was a scandalous thing to excuse the Mamertines, whose case was exactly the\n same, and from whom all previous praetors had exacted the same contribution that\n they did from the rest, and had paid them for it according to the resolution of the\n senate, and the law. And in order to drive in this indulgence with a big nail, as\n one may say, he takes cognisance of the cause of the Mamertines while sitting on the\n bench with his assessors, and pronounces judgment, that he, according to the\n decision of the bench, does not demand any corn from the Mamertines. \n ",
                "53":"\n Listen to the decree of the mercenary praetor from his own note-book; and take\n notice how great his gravity is in framing a degree, how great his dignity is in\n pronouncing it. Read the next memorandum of his decrees. [The decree, extracted from\n Verres's note-book, is read.] He says, “that he does this willingly,” and therefore\n he makes the entry in his book. What then? suppose you had not used this word\n “ willingly ,” should we, forsooth, have supposed that you made this\n profit unwillingly? “And by the advice of the bench;” you have heard a fair list of\n the assessors read to you, O judges Did it seem to you, when you heard their names,\n that a list of assessors to a praetor was being read, or a roll of the troop and\n company of a most infamous bandit? \n ",
                "54":"\n Here are interpreters of treaties, settlers of the terms of alliances, authorities\n as to religious obligations! Corn was never bought in Sicily by public order, without the Mamertines being ordered to\n furnish their just proportion, till that fellow appointed this select and admirable\n bench of his, in order to get money from them, and to act up to his invariable\n character. Therefore, that decree had just the weight that the authority of that man\n ought to have, who sold a decree to those men from whom it had been his duty to buy\n corn. For Lucius Metellus, the moment he arrived as his successor, required corn of\n the Mamertines, according to the regulations and appointment of Caius Sacerdos and\n Sextus Peducaeus. \n ",
                "55":"\n Then the Mamertines perceived that they could not longer retain the privilege which\n they had bought from its unprincipled author. Come now, you, who were desirous to be\n thought such a scrupulous interpreter of treaties, tell us why you compelled the\n Tauromenians and the Netians to furnish corn; for both of those are confederate\n cities. And the Netians were not wanting to themselves, for as soon as you\n pronounced your decision that you willingly excused the Mamertines, they came before\n you, and proved to you that their case under the treaty was exactly the same. You\n could not make a different decree in a case which was identical with the other. You\n pronounce that the Netians are not bound to furnish corn, and still you exact it\n from them. Give me the papers of this same praetor referring to his decrees, and to\n the corn that was ordered to be supplied, and to the wheat that was bought. [The\n papers of the praetor referring to the decrees, to the corn ordered to be supplied,\n and to the wheat purchased, are read.] In a case of such enormous and shameful\n inconsistency, what can we suspect, O judges, rather than that which is inevitable;\n either that money was not given to him by the Netians when he demanded it, or else\n that the Mamertines were given to understand that they had disposed of all their\n bribes and presents very advantageously, when others, whose case was identical with\n theirs, could not obtain the same privileges? \n ",
                "56":"\n Will he here again venture to make mention to me of the panegyric of the\n Mamertines? for who is there of you, O judges, who is not aware how many weapons\n that furnishes against him? In the first place, as in courts of justice it is more\n respectable for a man who cannot produce ten witnesses to speak to his character, to\n produce none at all, than not to complete the number made as it were legitimate by\n usage; so there are a great many cities in Sicily over which you were governor for three years; almost all the\n rest accuse you; a few insignificant ones, kept back by fear, say nothing; one\n speaks in your favour. What does all this show except that you are aware how\n advantageous genuine evidence to a person's character is; but that, nevertheless,\n your administration of the province was such that you are forced of necessity to do\n without that advantage? \n ",
                "57":"\n In the next place, as I said before on another occasion, what sort of a panegyric\n is that, when the chief men of the deputation commissioned to utter it, stated, both\n that a ship had been built for you at the public expense, and also that they\n themselves had been plundered and pillaged by you in respect of their private\n property? Lastly, what else is it that these people do, when they are the only\n people in all Sicily who praise you, beyond proving to us that you gave them\n everything of which you robbed our republic? What colony is there in Italy in possession of such privileges, what\n municipality is there enjoying such immunities, as to have had for all these years\n such a profitable exemption from all burdens, as the city of the Mamertines has had\n for three years? They alone have not given what they were bound to give according to\n the treaties; they alone, as long as that man was praetor, enjoyed immunity from all\n burdens; they alone under that man's authority lived in such a condition that they\n gave nothing to the Roman people, and refused nothing to Verres. \n ",
                "58":"\n But to return to the fleet, from which topic I have been digressing; you accepted a\n ship from the Mamertines contrary to the laws; you granted them relaxation contrary\n to the treaties; so that you behaved like a rogue twice in the case of one city, as\n you both granted indulgences which you had no right to grant, and accepted what it\n was not lawful for you to accept. You ought to have exacted a ship from them fit to\n sail against robbers, not to carry off the produce of your robberies; one which\n might have defended the province from being despoiled, not one that was to bear away\n the fresh spoils of the province. The Mamertines gave you both a city to which you\n might carry all the plunder you amassed from all quarters, and also a ship, in which\n you might take it away. That town was a receptacle for your plunder, those men were\n the witnesses to and guardians of your plunder; they supplied to you both a\n repository for your thefts, and a conveyance for them. In consequence, even when you\n had lost a fleet by your own avarice and worthlessness, you did not venture to\n require a ship of the Mamertines, at a time when our want of ships was so excessive,\n and the distress of the province so great, that, even if it had been necessary to\n beg as supplicants for a ship, they would have granted it. But all your power either\n of commanding a vessel to be furnished, or of begging for one, was crippled, not by\n the bireme supplied to the Roman people, but by that splendid merchant vessel given\n to the praetor. That was the price of your authority, of the reinforcement they were\n bound to supply, of exemption from the requirements of law, and usage, and of the\n treaty. \n ",
                "59":"\n You have now the case of the trusty assistance of one city lost to us and sold.\n Now listen to a new system of robbery first invented by Verres. \n \n \n Each city was always accustomed to give to its admiral the money\n necessary for the expense of the fleet, for provisions, for pay, and for all such\n things. The admiral did not dare to give the sailors any ground for accusing him,\n and was, besides, bound to render an account of the money to his fellow-citizens. In\n the whole business all the trouble and all the risk was his. This, I say, was the\n regular course not only in Sicily , but in\n every province, even in the case of the pay and expense of the Latin allies, at the\n time when we were accustomed to employ their assistance. Verres was the first man,\n ever since our dominion was established, who ordered that all that money should be\n paid to him by the cities, in order that whoever he chose to appoint might have the\n handling of that money. \n ",
                "60":"\n Who can doubt why you were the first man to change the ancient custom of all your\n predecessors, to disregard the great advantage of having the money pass through the\n hands of others, and to undertake a work of such difficulty, so liable to\n accusation,—a task of such delicacy, inseparable from suspicion? After that, other\n sources of gain are established arising from this one article of the navy; just\n listen to their number, O judges;—he receives money from the cities to excuse them\n from furnishing sailors; the sailors that are furnished he releases for a bribe; he\n makes a profit of the whole of thee pay of those who are thus released; he does not\n pay the rest all that he ought to pay. All this you shall have proved to you by the\n evidence of the cities. Read the evidence of the cities. [The evidence of the cities\n is read.] \n ",
                "61":"\n Did you ever hear of such a man? Did you ever hear, O judges, of such impudence? of\n such audacity? to impose on the cities the payment of a sum of money in proportion\n to the number of soldiers, and to fix a regular price, six hundred sesterces , for the discharge of each sailor! and as those\n who paid that sum were released from service for the whole summer, Verres pocketed\n all that he received both for their pay and for their maintenance. And by this means\n he made a double profit of the discharge of one person. And this most insane of men,\n at a time of frequent invasion of pirates, and of imminent danger to the province,\n did this so openly, that the pirates themselves were aware of it, and the whole\n province was a witness to it. \n ",
                "62":"\n When, owing to this man's inordinate avarice, there was a fleet indeed in name in\n Sicily , but in reality empty ships, fit\n only to carry plunder for the praetor, not to strike terror into pirates;\n nevertheless, while Publius Caesetius and Publius Tadius were sailing about with\n these ten half-manned ships, they, I will not say took, but led away with them one\n ship, laden with the spoils of the pirates, evidently overwhelmed and sinking with\n the burden of its freight. That vessel was full of a number of most beautiful\n quilts, full of quantities of well-wrought plate, and of coined money; full of\n embroidered robes. This one vessel was not taken by our fleet, but was found at\n Megaris , a place not far from Syracuse . And when the news was brought to him,\n although he was lying in his tent on the shore, with a lot of women, drunk, still he\n roused himself, and immediately sent to the quaestor and to his own lieutenant many\n men to act as guards, in order that everything might be brought to him to see in an\n uninjured state, as soon as possible. \n ",
                "63":"\n The vessel is brought to Syracuse .\n All expect that the pirates will be punished. He, as if it was not a case of pirates\n being taken, but of a booty being brought to him, considers all the prisoners who\n were old or ugly as enemies; those who had any beauty, or youth, or skill in\n anything, he takes away: some he distributed among his clerks, his retinue, and his\n son; six skillful musicians he sends to Rome as a present to some friend of his. All that night he spent in\n unloading the ship. No one sees the captain of the pirate vessel, who ought to have\n been executed. And to this very day every one believes, (how much truth there is in\n the belief, you also may be able to conjecture,) that Verres secretly took money of\n the pirates for the release of the captain of the pirates. \n ",
                "64":"\n It is only a conjecture; but no one can be a good judge who is not influenced by\n such certain grounds of suspicion. You know the man, you know the custom of all\n men,—how gladly any one who has taken a chief of pirates or of the enemy, allows him\n to be seen openly by all men. But of all the body of citizens and settlers at\n Syracuse , I never saw one man, O\n judges, who said that he had seen that captain of the pirates who had been taken;\n though all men, as is the regular custom, flocked to the prison, asked for him, and\n were anxious to see him. What happened to make that man be kept so carefully out of\n sight, that no one was ever able to get a glimpse of him, even by accident? Though\n all the seafaring men at Syracuse , who\n had often heard of the name of that captain, who had often been alarmed by him,\n wished to feed their eyes on, and to gratify their minds with his torture and\n execution, yet no one was allowed even to see him. \n ",
                "65":"\n One man, Publius Servilius, took more captains of pirates alive than all our\n commanders put together had done before. Was any one at any time denied the\n enjoyment of being allowed to see a captive pirate? On the contrary: wherever\n Servilius went he afforded every one that most delightful spectacle, of pirates\n taken prisoners and in chains. Therefore, people everywhere ran to meet him, so that\n the, assembled not only in the towns through which the pirates were led, but from\n all neighbouring towns also, for the purpose of seeing them. And why was it that\n that triumph was of all triumphs the most acceptable and the most delightful to the\n Roman people? Because nothing is sweeter than victory. But there is no more certain\n evidence of victory than to set those whom you have often been afraid of, led in\n chains to execution. \n ",
                "66":"\n Why did you not act in this manner? Why was that pirate so concealed as if it were\n impiety to behold him? Why did you not execute him? For what object did you reserve\n him? Have you ever heard of any captain of pirates having been taken prisoner\n before, who was not executed? Tell me one original whose conduct you imitated; tell\n me one precedent. You kept the captain of the pirates alive in order, I suppose, to\n lead him in your triumph in front of your chariot. For, indeed, there was nothing\n wanting but for the naval triumph to be decreed to you on the occasion of a most\n beautiful fleet of the Roman people having been lost, and the province plundered.\n \n ",
                "67":"\n Come now—you thought it better that the captain of the pirates should be kept in\n custody, according to a novel practice, than that he should be put to death\n according to universal precedent. What then is that custody? Among what people?\n Where is he kept? You have all heard of the Syracusan stone-quarries. Many of you\n are acquainted with them. It is a vast work and splendid; the work of the old kings\n and tyrants. The whole of it is cut out of rock excavated to a marvellous depth, and\n carved out by the labour of great multitudes of men. Nothing can either be made or\n imagined so closed against all escape, so hedged in on all sides, so safe for\n keeping prisoners in. Into these quarries men are commanded to be brought even from\n other cities in Sicily , if they are\n commanded by the public authorities to be kept in custody. \n ",
                "68":"\n Because he had imprisoned there many Roman citizens who were his prisoners, and\n because he ordered the other pirates to be put there too, he was aware that if he\n committed this counterfeit captain of the pirates to the same custody, a great many\n men in those quarries would inquire for the real captain. And therefore he does not\n venture to commit the man to this best of all and safest of all places of\n confinement. In fact he is afraid of the whole of Syracuse . He sends the man away. Where to? Perhaps to Lilybaeum . I see; he was not then so entirely afraid\n of the seafaring men? By no means, O judges. To Panormus then? I understand; although indeed, since he was taken\n within the Syracusan district, he ought, at all events, to have been kept in prison\n at Syracuse , if he was not to be\n executed there. \n ",
                "69":"\n Not at Panormus even. What then?\n where do you suppose it was? He sends him away to men the furthest removed from all\n fear or suspicion of pirates, as unconnected as possible with, all navigation or\n maritime affairs—to the Centuripans, a thoroughly inland people, complete farmers,\n who would never have been alarmed at the name of a naval pirate, but who, while you\n were praetor, had lived in dread of that chief of all land pirates, Apronius. And,\n that every one might easily see that Verres's object was, that that counterfeit\n might easily and cheerfully pretend to be what he was not, he enjoins the\n Centuripans to take case that he is supplied as comfortably and liberally as\n possible with food and with all things. \n ",
                "70":"\n In the meantime, the Syracusans, acute and humane men, who were capable not only of\n seeing what was evident, but also of conjecturing what was hidden, kept an account\n every day of the pirates who were put to death; how many there ought to be they\n calculated from the size of the vessel itself which had been taken, and from the\n number of oars. He, because he had removed and taken away all who had any skill in\n anything, or any beauty, suspected that there would be an outcry if he had all the\n pirates fastened to the stake at once, as is the usual custom, because so many more\n had been taken away than were left: although on this account he had determined to\n bring them out in different parties, at different times, still in the whole city\n there was no one who did not keep a strict account and list of them; and they did\n not only wish to see the rest, but they openly demanded and claimed it. \n ",
                "71":"\n As there was a great number wanting, that most infamous man began to substitute, in\n the room of those of the pirates whom he had taken into his own house, the Roman\n citizens whom he had previously thrown into prison; some of whom he accused of\n having been soldiers of Sertorius, and said that they had been driven on shore in\n Sicily , while flying from Spain ; others, who had been taken by pirates, while\n they were engaged in commerce, or else sailing with some other object, he accused of\n having been with the pirates of their own free will: and therefore some Roman\n citizens, with their heads muffled up; that they might not be recognised, were taken\n from prison to the fatal stake and to execution; others, though they were recognised\n by many Roman citizens, and though all attempted to defend them, were put to death.\n But of their most shameful death did most cruel tortures I will speak when I begin\n to discuss this topic; and I will speak with such feelings, that, if in the course\n of that complaint which I shall make of that man's cruelty, and of the most\n scandalous execution of Roman citizens, not only my strength, but even my life\n should fail me, I should think it delightful and honourable. \n ",
                "72":"\n These then are his exploits, this is his splendid victory; a piratical galley was\n captured, the captain was released, the musicians were sent to Rome ; those with any good looks, any youth, or ally\n skill, were taken home by him; Roman citizens were tortured and executed in their\n room, and to make up their number; all the store of robes was taken away, all the\n silver and gold was taken by him and appropriated to his own use. \n \n \n But how did he defend himself at the former pleading? He who had\n been silent for so many days, on a sudden sprang up at the evidence of Marcus\n Annius, a most illustrious man, when he said that a Roman citizen had been executed,\n and that the captain of the pirates had not. Being roused by the consciousness of\n his wickedness, and by the frenzy which was inspired by his crimes, he said that,\n because be knew that he should be accused of having taken money, and of not having\n executed the real captain of the pirates, he had on that account not executed him,\n and he said that two captains of pirates were now in confinement in his house. \n ",
                "73":"\n See the clemency, or rather the marvellous and unexampled patience of the Roman\n people! Annius, a Roman knight, says that a Roman citizen was put to death by the\n hand of the executioner. You say nothing. He says that the captain of the pirates\n was not executed. You admit it. At that a groan and outcry arises from all the\n assembly; though nevertheless the Roman people checked themselves, and forbore to\n inflict present punishment on you, and left you in safety for the present, being\n reserved for the severity of the judges. You, who knew that you should be accused,\n how did you know it? how came you ever to suspect it? You had no enemy. Even if you\n had, still you had not lived in such a way as to have any fear of a court of justice\n before yourselves. Did conscience, as often happens, make you timid and suspicious?\n Can you, then, who, when you were in command, were even then in fear of tribunals\n and accusations, now that you are on your trial as a criminal, and that the case is\n proved against you by so many witnesses, can you, I say, doubt of your condemnation?\n \n ",
                "74":"\n But if you were afraid of this accusation,—that some one might say that you had\n substituted some one else, whom you had caused to be executed for the captain of the\n pirates, did you think that it would be a stronger argument in your defence, to\n produce among strangers a long time after, (because I required and compelled you to\n do so,) a man who you said was the captain of the pirates; or to execute him, while\n the affair was still of recent date, at Syracuse , among people who knew him well, in the sight of almost all\n Sicily ? See how great a difference it\n makes which was done. In the one case there could have been no blame attached to\n you; in the other you have no defence. And accordingly, all men have always done the\n one thing; but I can find no one before you yourself, who has ever done the other.\n You detained the pirate alive. Till when? As long as you were in command. Why did\n you do so? On what account? According to what precedent? Why did you detain him so\n long? Why, I say, while the Roman citizens who were taken in the pirate's company\n were immediately put to death, did you give the pirates themselves so long a lease\n of life? \n ",
                "75":"\n However, so be it. Let your conduct be responsible all the time that you were\n praetor. Did you still, when you became a private man, and when you became\n defendant—yes, and when you were all but condemned,—did you still, I say, detain the\n captain of our enemies in your private house? One month, a second month, almost a\n year, in fact, after they were taken, were the pirates in your house; where they\n would be still, if it had not been for me, that is to say, if it had not been for\n Marcus Acilius Glabrio, the praetor, who, at my demand, ordered them to be brought\n up and to be committed to prison. \n \n What is the law\n in such a case? What is the general custom? What are the precedents? Can any private\n man in the whole world detain within the walls of his own house the most bitter and\n unceasing enemy of the Roman people or, I should rather say, the common enemy of\n every race and nation? \n ",
                "76":"\n What more shall I say? What would you say, if the very day before you were\n compelled by me to confess that, though you had put Roman citizens to death, the\n pirate captain was alive and in your house—if, I say, the very day before, he had\n escaped from your house, and had been able to collect an army against the Roman\n people? Would you say, “He dwelt with me, he was in my house; in order the more\n easily to refute the accusations of my enemies, I reserved this man alive and in\n safety for my trial?” Is it so? Will you defend yourself from danger, at the risk of\n the whole community? Will you regulate the time of the punishments which are due to\n conquered enemies, by what is convenient for yourself, not by what is expedient for\n the Roman people? Shall an enemy of the Roman people be kept in private custody? But\n even those who have triumphs, and who on that account keep the generals of the enemy\n alive a longer time, in order that, while they are led in triumph, the Roman people\n may enjoy an ennobling spectacle, and a splendid fruit of victory; nevertheless,\n when they begin to turn their chariot from the forum towards the Capitol, order them\n to be taken back to prison, and the same day brings to the conquerors the end of\n their authority, and to the conquered the end of their lives. \n ",
                "77":"\n And now, can I suppose that any one doubts that you would never have allowed\n (especially as you made sure, as you say, that a prosecution would be instituted\n against you) that pirate to escape execution, and to live to increase your danger\n which was ever before your eyes? For indeed, suppose he had died, whom could you\n (who say that you were afraid of a prosecution) have convinced of it? When it was\n notorious that the captain of the pirates had been seen by no one at Syracuse , and that all desired to see him; when\n no one had any doubt that he had been released by you for a sum of money; when it\n was a common topic of conversation that some one had been substituted in his place,\n who you wished to make believe was the man; when you yourself had confessed that you\n had, for so long a time before, been afraid of that accusation; if you had said that\n he had died, who would have believed you? \n ",
                "78":"\n Now, when you produce this man of yours, whoever he may be, still you see that you\n are laughed at. What would you have done if he had escaped? if he had broken his\n bonds, as Nico, that most celebrated pirate did, who was afterwards retaken by\n Publius Servilius, with the same good fortune as he had originally taken him with;\n what would you have said then? But the case was this.—If once that real captain of\n the pirates was put to death, you would not get that money. If this counterfeit one\n had died or had escaped, it would not have been difficult to substitute another in\n the room of one who was himself only a substitute. I have said more than I intended\n of that pirate captain; and yet I have passed over those things which are the most\n certain proofs of this crime. For I wish the whole of this accusation to remain\n untouched for the present. There is a certain place for its discussion, a certain\n law to be mentioned in connection with it, a certain tribunal for whose judgment it\n is reserved. \n ",
                "79":"\n Though enriched with all this booty, with these slaves, with this silver plate, and\n these robes, he was still no more diligent than before in equipping the fleet, in\n recalling and provisioning the troops; though that would not only have tended to the\n safety of the province, but might have been even profitable to himself. For in the\n height of summer, when all other praetors have been accustomed to visit all the\n province, and to travel about, or to sail about,—at a time when there was such fear\n of and such danger from the pirates; at that time he was not content, for the\n purpose of his luxury and lust, with his own kingly palace which had belonged to\n king Hiero, and which the praetors are in the habit of using. He ordered, as I have\n stated already, tents, such as he was wont to use at the summer season, erected of\n fine linen curtains, to be pitched on the seashore; on that part of the shore which\n is within the island of Syracuse ,\n behind the fountain of Arethusa; close to the entrance and mouth of the harbour, in\n a very pleasant situation, and one far enough removed from overlookers. \n ",
                "80":"\n Here the praetor of the Roman people, the guardian and defender of the province,\n lived for sixty days of the summer in such a style that he had banquets of women\n every day, while no man was admitted except himself and his youthful son. Although,\n indeed, I might have made no exception, but might have said that there was no man\n there at all, as there were only these two. Sometimes also his freedman Timarchides\n was admitted. But the women were all wives of citizens, of noble birth, except one\n the daughter of an actor named Isidorus, whom he, out of love, had seduced away from\n a Rhodian flute player. There was a woman called Pippa, the wife of Aeschrio the\n Syracusan, concerning which woman many verses, which were made on Verres's fondness\n for her, are quoted over all Sicily . \n ",
                "81":"\n There was a woman too, called Nice, with a very beautiful face, as it is said, the\n wife of Cleomenes the Syracusan. Cleomenes, her husband, was greatly attached to\n her, but still he had neither the power nor the courage to oppose the lust of the\n praetor; and at the same time he was bound to him by many presents and many good\n offices. But at that time Verres, though you well know how great his impudence is,\n still could not, as her husband was at Syracuse , be quite easy in his mind at keeping her with him so many\n days on the seashore. Accordingly, he contrives a very singular plan. He gives the\n command of the fleet, which his lieutenant had had, to Cleomenes. He orders\n Cleomenes, a Syracusan, to command a fleet of the Roman people. He does this, in\n order that he might not only be absent from home all the time that he was at sea,\n but that he might be so willingly, being placed in a post of great honour and\n profit; and that he himself in the meantime, the husband being sent away to a\n distance, might have her with him,—I will not say more easily than before, for who\n ever opposed his lust? but with a rather more tranquil mind, as he had got rid of\n him, not as a husband but as a rival.—Cleomenes, a Syracusan, takes the command of a\n fleet of our allies and friends. \n ",
                "82":"\n What topic of accusation or complaint shall I urge first, O judges? That the power,\n and honour, and authority of a lieutenant, of a quaestor, yes, even of a praetor,\n was given to a Sicilian? If you were so occupied with feasts and women as to be\n prevented from taking the command yourself, where were your quaestors? where were\n your lieutenants? where was the corn valued at three denarii ? where were the mules? where were the tents? where were all the\n numerous and splendid badges of honour conferred and bestowed by the senate and\n people of Rome on their magistrates and\n lieutenants? Lastly, where were your prefects and tribunes? If there was no Roman\n citizen worthy of that employment, what had become of the cities which had always\n remained true to the alliance and friendship of the Roman people? What had become of\n the city of Segesta? of the city of Centuripa? which both by old services, by good\n faith, by antiquity of alliance, and even by relationship, are connected with the\n name of the Roman people. \n ",
                "83":"\n O ye immortal gods! What shall we say, when Cleomenes, a Syracusan, is ordered to\n command the soldiers, and the ships, and the officers of these very cities? Has not\n Verres by such an action taken away all the honour due to worth, to justice, and to\n old services? Have we ever once waged war in Sicily , that we have not had the Centuripans for our friends, and the\n Syracusans for our enemies? And I am speaking now only by way of recollection of\n past time, not as meaning insult to that city. And therefore that most illustrious\n man and consummate general, Marcus Marcellus, by whose valour Syracuse was taken, by whose clemency it was\n preserved, forbade any Syracusan to dwell in that part of the city which is called\n the Island. To this day, I say, it is contrary to law for any Syracusan to dwell in\n that part of the city. For it is a place which even a very few men can defend. And\n therefore he would not entrust it to any but the most faithful men; and he had\n another reason too, because in that part of the city there is access to ships from\n the open sea. Therefore he did not think fit to entrust the keys of the place to\n those who had often excluded our armies. \n ",
                "84":"\n See now how great is the difference between your lust and the authority of our\n ancestors; between your love and frenzy, and their wisdom and prudence. They took\n away from the Syracusans all access to the shore; you have given them the command of\n the sea. They would not allow a Syracusans to dwell in that part of the city which\n ships could approach; you appointed a Syracusan to command the fleet and the ships.\n You gave those men a part of our sovereignty, from whom they took a part of their\n own city; and you ordered those allies of ours to be obedient to the Syracusans, to\n whose aid it is owing that the Syracusans are obedient to us. \n ",
                "85":"\n Cleomenes leaves the harbour in a Centuripan trireme. A Segestan vessel comes next;\n then a Tyndaritan ship; then one from Herbita, one from Heraclia, one from\n Apollonia , one from Haluntium; a\n fine fleet to look at, but helpless and useless because of the discharge of its\n fighting men, and of its rowers. That diligent praetor surveyed the fleet under his\n orders, as long as it was passing by his scene of profligate revelry. And he too,\n who for many days had not been seen, then for a short time afforded the sailors a\n sight of himself. The praetor of the Roman people stood in his slippers, clad in a\n purple cloak, and a tunic reaching down to his ankles, leaning on a prostitute on\n the shore. And since that time, many Sicilians and Roman citizens have often seen\n him in this very dress. \n ",
                "86":"\n After the fleet had proceeded a little way, and had arrived, after five days'\n sailing, at Pachynum, the sailors, being compelled by hunger, gather the roots of\n the wild palm, of which there was a great quantity in that neighbourhood, as there\n is in most parts of Sicily , and support\n themselves in a miserable and wretched way on these. But Cleomenes, who considered\n himself another Verres, not only in luxury and worthlessness, but in power also,\n spent, like him, all his days in drinking in a tent which he had pitched on the\n seashore. \n \n But all of a sudden, while Cleomenes\n was drunk, and all his crews famishing, news is brought that a fleet of pirates is\n in the harbour of Odyssea; for that is the name of the place. But our fleet was in\n the harbour of Pachynum. But Cleomenes, because there was a garrison of troops (in\n name, if not in reality) in that place, fancied that, with the soldiers he drew from\n thence, he might make up his proper complement of sailors and rowers. The same\n system was found to nave been put in practice by that most covetous man with respect\n to the troops, that had been adopted towards the fleet, for only a few remained, and\n the rest had been discharged. \n ",
                "87":"\n Cleomenes, as commander-in-chief, in a Centuripan quadrireme ordered the mast to be\n erected, the sails to be set, the anchor to be weighed, and made signal for the rest\n of the ships to follow him. This Centuripan vessel was an extraordinarily fast\n sailer; for, while Verres was praetor, no one had any opportunity of knowing what\n each ship could do with oars; although in order to do honour and to show favour to\n Cleomenes, there was a much smaller deficiency of rowers and soldiers in that\n quadrireme. The quadrireme, almost flying, had already got out of sight, while the\n other ships were still hard at work in their original station. \n ",
                "88":"\n However those who were left behind displayed a good deal of courage. Although they\n were few in numbers, still they cried out, that whatever might be the event, they\n were willing to fight; and they preferred losing by the sword the little life and\n strength that hunger had left them. And if Cleomenes had not run away so long\n before, there would have been some means of making resistance, for that ship was the\n only one with a deck, and was large enough to have been a bulwark to the rest, and\n if it had been engaged in battle with the pirates, it would have looked like a city\n among those piratical galleys; but at that time the sailors being helpless, and\n deserted by their commander and prefect of the fleet, began of necessity to hold the\n same course that he had held. \n ",
                "89":"\n Accordingly they all sailed towards Elorum, as Cleomenes had done; but they indeed\n were not so much flying from the attack of the pirates as following their commander.\n Then as each was last in flight, he was first in danger, for the pirates came upon\n the last ships first, and so the Haluntian vessel is taken first, which was\n commanded by an Haluntian of noble birth, Philarchus by name, whom the Locrians\n afterwards ransomed at the public expense from those pirates, and from whom, on his\n oath, you at the former pleading learnt the whole of the circumstances and their\n cause. The Apollonian vessel is taken next, and Anthropinus, its captain, is slain.\n \n ",
                "90":"\n While all this was going on, in the meantime Cleomenes had already arrived at\n Elorum, already he had hastened on land from the ship, and had left the quadrireme\n tossing about in the surf. The rest of the captains of ships, when the\n commander-in-chief had landed, as they had no possible means either of resisting or\n of escaping by sea, ran their ships ashore at Elorum, and followed Cleomenes. Then\n Heracleo, the captain of the pirates, being suddenly victorious, beyond all his\n hopes, not through any valour of his own, but owing to the avarice and worthlessness\n of Verres, as soon as evening came on, ordered a most beautiful fleet belonging to\n the Roman people, having been driven on shore and abandoned, to be set fire to and\n burnt. \n ",
                "91":"\n O what a miserable and bitter time for the province of Sicily ! O what an event, calamitous and fatal to many innocent\n people! O what unexampled worthlessness and infamy of that man! On one and the same\n night, the praetor was burning with the flame of the most disgraceful love, a fleet\n of the Roman people with the fire of pirates. It was a stormy night when the news of\n this terrible disaster was brought to Syracuse—men run to the praetor's house, to\n which his women had conducted him back a little while before from his splendid\n banquet, with songs and music. Cleomenes, although it was night, still does not dare\n to show himself in public. He shuts himself up in his house, but his wife was not\n there to console her husband in his misfortunes. \n ",
                "92":"\n But the discipline of this noble commander-in-chief was so strict in his own house,\n that though the event was so important, the news so serious, still no one could be\n admitted; no one dared either to wake him if asleep, or to address him if awake. But\n now, when the affair had become known to everybody, a vast multitude was collecting\n in every part of the city; for the arrival of the pirates was not given notice of,\n as had formerly been the custom, by a fire raised on a watchtower, or a hill, but\n both the disaster that had already been sustained, and the danger that was\n impending, were notified by the conflagration of the fleet itself. \n \n \n When the praetor was inquired for, and when it was plain that no\n one had told him the news, a rush of people towards his house takes place with great\n impetuosity and loud cries. \n ",
                "93":"\n Then, he himself, being roused, comes forth; he hears the whole news from\n Timarchides; he takes his military cloak. It was now nearly dawn. He comes forth\n into the middle of the crowd, bewildered with wine, and sleep, and debauchery. He is\n received by all with such a shout that it seemed to bring before his eyes a\n resemblance to the dangers of Lampsacus .\n But this present appeared greater than that,\n because, though both the mobs hated him equally, the numbers here were much greater.\n People began to talk to one another of his tent on the shore, of his flagitious\n banquets; the names of his women were called out by the crowd; men asked him openly\n where he had been, and what he had been doing for so many days together, during\n which no one had seen him. Then they demanded Cleomenes, who had been appointed\n commander-in-chief by him; and nothing was ever nearer happening than the\n transference of the precedent of Utica in\n the case of Hadrian \n to Syracuse ; so that two graves of two\n most infamous governors would have been contained in two provinces. However, regard\n was had by the multitude to the time, regard was had to the impending danger, regard\n was had, too, to their common dignity and character, because the body of settlers of\n Roman citizens at Syracuse is such as\n to be considered the most dignified body, not only in that province, but even in\n this republic. \n ",
                "94":"\n They all encourage one another, while he is still half asleep and stupefied; they\n take arms; they fill the whole forum and the island, which is a considerable portion\n of the whole city. The pirates having remained at Elorum that single night, left our\n ships still smoking, and began to sail to Syracuse ; for as they, forsooth, had often heard that nothing could\n be finer than the fortifications and harbour of Syracuse , they had made up their minds that if they did not see them\n while Verres was praetor, they should never see them at all. \n ",
                "95":"\n And first of all they came to those summer quarters of the praetor, landing at that\n very part of the shore where he, having pitched his tents, had set up his camp of\n luxury while all this was going on. But when they found the place empty, and\n understood that the praetor had removed his quarters from that place, they\n immediately, without any fear, began to penetrate to the harbour itself. When I say\n into the harbour, O judges, (for I must explain myself carefully for the sake of\n those who are unacquainted with the place,) I mean that the pirates came into the\n city, and into the most central parts of the city; for that town is not closed in by\n the harbour, but the harbour itself is surrounded and closed in by the town; so that\n it is not only the innermost walls that are washed by the sea, but the harbour, if I\n may so say, flows into the very bosom of the city. \n ",
                "96":"\n Here, while you were praetor, Heracleo, the captain of the pirates, with four small\n galleys, sailed about at his pleasure. O ye immortal gods! a piratical galley, while\n the representative of the Roman people, its name and its forces were all in\n Syracuse , came up to the very forum,\n and to all the quays of the city. Those most glorious fleets of the Carthaginians,\n when they were at the very height of their naval power, though they often made the\n attempt in many wars, were never able to advance so far. Even the naval glory of the\n Roman people, invincible as it was till your praetorship, in all the Punic and\n Sicilian wars never penetrated so far. The situation of the place is such that the\n Syracusans usually saw their enemies armed and victorious within their walls, in the\n city, and in the forum, before they saw any enemy's ship in their harbour. \n ",
                "97":"\n Here, while you were praetor, galleys of pirates sailed about, where previously the\n only fleet that had ever entered in the history of the world, was the Athenian fleet\n of three hundred ships, which forced its way in by its weight and its numbers; and\n that fleet was in that very harbour defeated and destroyed, owing to the natural\n character of the place and harbour. Here first was the power of that splendid city\n defeated, weakened, and impaired. In this harbour, shipwreck was made of the\n nobleness and dominion and glory of Athens . \n \n \n Did a pirate penetrate to that part of the city\n which he could not approach without leaving a great part of the city not only on his\n flanks but in his rear? He passed by the whole island, which is at Syracuse a very considerable part of the city,\n having its own distinct name, and separate walls; in which part, as I said before,\n our ancestors forbade any Syracusan to dwell, because they knew that the harbour\n would be in the power of whatever people were occupying that district of the city.\n \n ",
                "98":"\n And how did he wander through it? He threw down around him the roots of the wild\n palms which he had found in our ships, in order that all men might become acquainted\n with the dishonesty of Verres, and the disaster of Sicily . O that Sicilian soldiers, children of those cultivators of\n the soil whose fathers produced such crops of corn by their labour that they were\n able to supply the Roman people and the whole of Italy ,—that they, born in the island of\n Ceres , where corn is said to have been\n first discovered, should have been driven to use such food as their ancestors, by\n the discovery of corn, had delivered all other nations from! While you were praetor\n the Sicilian soldiers were fed on the roots of wild palms, pirates on Sicilian corn.\n \n ",
                "99":"\n O miserable and bitter spectacle! that the glory of the city and the name of the\n Roman people should be a laughingstock; that in the face of all that body of\n inhabitants and all that multitude of people, a pirate in a piratical galley should\n celebrate a triumph in the harbour of Syracuse over a fleet of the Roman people, while the oars of the\n pirates were actually besprinkling the eyes of that most worthless and cowardly\n praetor. After the pirates had left the harbour, not because of any alarm, but\n because they were weary of staying there, these men began to inquire the cause of so\n great a disaster. All began to say, and to argue openly, that it was by no means\n strange, that when the soldiers and the crews had been dismissed, and the rest had\n been destroyed by want and famine, while the praetor was spending all his time in\n drinking with his women, such a disgrace and calamity should have fallen upon them.\n \n ",
                "100":"\n And all the reproaches which they heaped upon him, all the infamy that they\n attributed to him, was confirmed by the statements of those men who had been\n appointed by their own cities to command their ships; the rest of whom had fled to\n Syracuse after the loss of the\n fleet. Each of them stated how many men they knew had been discharged out of their\n respective ships. The matter was clear, and his avarice was proved not only by\n arguments, but also by undeniable witnesses. \n \n The\n man is informed that nothing is done in the forum and in the assembly all that day,\n except putting questions to the naval captains how the fleet was lost. That they\n made answer, and informed every one that it was owing to the discharge of the\n rowers, the want of food of the rest, the cowardice and desertion of Cleomenes. And\n when he heard this, he began to form this design. He had long since made up his mind\n that a prosecution would be instituted against him, long before this happened, as\n you have heard him say himself at the former pleading. He saw that if those naval\n captains were produced as witnesses against him, he should not be able to stand\n against so serious an accusation. He forms at first a plan, foolish indeed, but\n still merciful. \n ",
                "101":"\n He orders Cleomenes and the naval captains to be summoned before him. They come. He\n accuses them of having held this language about himself; he begs them to cease from\n holding it; and begs every one there to say that he had had in his ship as large a\n crew as he ought to have had, and that none had been discharged. They promise him to\n do whatever he wished. He does not delay. He immediately summons his friends. He\n then asks of all the captains separately how many sailors each had had on board his\n ship. Each of them answers as he had been enjoined to. He makes an entry of their\n answers in his journal. He seals it up, prudent man that he is, with the seals of\n his friends; in order forsooth, to use this evidence against this charge, if ever it\n should be necessary. \n ",
                "102":"\n I imagine that senseless man must have been laughed at by his own counselors, and\n warned that these documents would do him no good; that if the charge were made,\n there would be even more suspicion owing to these extraordinary precautions of the\n praetor. He had already behaved with such folly in many cases, as even publicly to\n order whatever he pleased to be expunged out of, or entered in the records of\n different cities. All which things he now finds out are of no use to him, since he\n is convicted by documents, and witnesses, and authorities which are all undeniable.\n \n \n When he sees that their confession, and all the\n evidence which he has manufactured, and his journals, will be of no use to him, he\n then adopts the design, not of a worthless praetor, (for even that might have been\n endured,) but an inhuman and senseless tyrant. He determines, that if he wishes to\n palliate that accusation, (for he did not suppose that he could get rid of it\n altogether,) all the naval captains, the witnesses of his wickedness, must be put to\n death. \n ",
                "103":"\n The next consideration was,—“What am I to do with Cleomenes? Can I put those men to\n death whom I placed under his command, and spare him whom I placed in command and\n authority over them? Can I punish those men who followed Cleomenes, and pardon\n Cleomenes who bade them fly with him, and follow him? Can I be severe to those men\n who had vessels not only devoid of crews, but devoid of decks, and be merciful to\n him who was the only man who had a decked ship, and whose ship, too, was not\n stripped bare like those of the others?” Cleomenes must die too. What signify his\n promises? what do the curses that he will heap on him? what do the pledges of\n friendship and mutual embraces? what does that comradeship in the service, of a\n woman on that most luxurious sea-shore signify? It was utterly impossible that\n Cleomenes could be spared. He summons Cleomenes. \n ",
                "104":"\n He tells him that he has made up his mind to execute all the naval captains; that\n considerations of his own personal danger required such a step. “I will spare you\n alone, and I will endure the blame of all that disaster myself, and all possible\n reproaches for my inconsistency, rather than act cruelly to you on the one hand, or,\n on the other hand, leave so many and such important witnesses against me in safety\n and in life.” Cleomenes thanks him: approves of his intention; and says that that is\n what must be done. But he reminds him, of what he had forgotten, that it will not he\n possible for him to put Phalargus the Centuripan, one of the naval captains, to\n death, because he had been with him himself in the Centuripan quadrireme. What,\n then, is he to do? Shall that man, of such a city as that, a most noble youth, be\n left to be a witness? At present, says Cleomenes, for it must be so; but afterwards\n we will take care that it shall be put out of his power to injure us. \n ",
                "105":"\n After all this was settled and determined, Verres immediately advances from his\n praetorian house, inflamed with wickedness, frenzy, and cruelty. He comes into the\n forum. He orders the naval captains to be summoned. They immediately come with all\n speed, as men who were afraid of nothing, and suspected nothing. He orders those\n unhappy and innocent men to be loaded with chains. They began to invoke the good\n faith of the praetor, and to ask why he did so? Then he says that this is the\n reason,—because they had betrayed the fleet to the pirates. There is a great outcry,\n and great astonishment on the part of the people, that there should be so much\n impudence and audacity in the man as to attribute to others the origin of a calamity\n which had happened entirely owing to his own avarice; or to bring against others a\n charge of treason, when he himself was thought to be a partner of the pirates; and\n lastly, they marveled at this charge not being originated till fifteen days after\n the fleet had been lost. \n ",
                "106":"\n While these things were happening, inquiry was made where Cleomenes was: not that\n any one thought him, such as he was, worthy of any punishment for that disaster; for\n what could Cleomenes have done, (for it is not in my nature to accuse any one\n falsely,)—what, I say, could Cleomenes have done of any consequence, when his ships\n had been dismantled by the avarice of Verres? And they see him sitting by the side\n of the praetor, and whispering familiarly in his ear, as he was accustomed to do.\n But then it did seem a most scandalous thing to every one, that most honourable men,\n chosen by their own cities, should be put in chains and in prison, but that\n Cleomenes, on account of his partnership with him in debauchery and infamy, should\n be the praetor's most familiar friend. \n ",
                "107":"\n However, an accuser is produced against them, a certain Naevius Turpio, who, when\n Caius Sacerdos was praetor, had been convicted of an assault; a very suitable tool\n for the audacity of Verres; a man whom he had frequently employed in matters\n connected with the tenths, in capital prosecutions, and in every sort of false\n accusation, as a scout and emissary. \n \n The parents\n and relations of these unfortunate young men came to Syracuse , being aroused by the sudden news of\n this misfortune. They see their children loaded with chains, bearing on their necks\n and shoulders the punishment due to the avarice of Verres. They come forward, they\n defend them, they raise an outcry; they implore your good faith which at no time and\n no place had ever any existence. The father of one came forward, Dexis the\n Tyndaritan; a man of the noblest family, connected by ties of hospitality with you\n yourself, at whose house you had been, whom you had called your friend. When you saw\n him, a man of such high rank in such distress could not his tears, could not his old\n age could not the claims of hospitality and the name of friend recall you back from\n your wickedness to some degree of humanity? \n ",
                "108":"\n But why do I speak of the claims of hospitality with reference to so inhuman a\n monster?

Another father, from another district, was Eubulida of\n Herlita: a man of great reputation in his city, and of high birth; who, because he\n had injured Cleomenes in defending his son, had been left nearly destitute. But what\n was there which any one could say or allege in his defence? They are not allowed to\n name Cleomenes. But the cause compels them to do so. You shall die if you do name\n him, (for he never threatened any one with trifling punishment.) But there were no\n rowers. What! are you accusing the praetor? Break his neck.

He\n makes similar statements with respect to the other ships and when he uttered these\n statements before you, he was scourged on the eyes. But when death was staring him\n in the face, he could easily endure pain of body; he cried out, what he has left\n also in writing, “That it was an infamous thing that the tears of an unchaste woman\n on behalf of the safety of Cleomenes should have more influence with you, than those\n of his mother for his life.” \n ",
                "112":"\n Afterwards I see that this also is stated, which, if the Roman people has formed a\n correct estimate of your characters, O judges, he, at the very hour of death, truly\n prophesied of you,—“That it was not possible for Verres to efface his own crimes by\n murdering the witnesses; that he, in the shades below, should be a still more\n serious witness against him, in the opinion of sensible judges, than if he were\n produced alive in a court of justice; for that then, if he were alive he would only\n be a witness to prove his avarice; but now, when he had been, put to death, he\n should be a witness of his wickedness, and audacity, and cruelty.” What follows is\n very fine,—“That, when your cause came to be tried, it would not be only the bands\n of witnesses, but the punishments inflicted on the innocent, and the furies that\n haunt the wicked, that would attend your trial; that he thought his own misfortune\n the lighter, because he had seen before now the edge of your axes, and the\n countenance and hand of Sextus your executioner, when in an assembly of Roman\n citizens, Roman citizens were publicly executed by your command.” \n ",
                "113":"\n Not to dwell too long on this, Junius used most freely that liberty which you have\n given the allies, even at the moment of bitter punishment, such as was only fit for\n slaves. \n \n He condemns them all, with the approval\n of his assessors. And yet, in so important an affair, in a cause in which so many\n men and so many citizens were concerned, he neither sent for Publius Vettius, his\n quaestor, to take his advice; nor for Publius Cervius, an admirable man, his\n lieutenant, who, because he had been lieutenant in Sicily , while he was praetor was the first man rejected by him as a\n judge; but he condemns them all in conformity with the opinion expressed by a lot of\n robbers, that is, by his own retinue. \n ",
                "114":"\n On this all the Sicilians, our most faithful and most ancient allies, who have had\n the greatest kindnesses conferred on them by our ancestors, were greatly agitated,\n and alarmed at their own danger, and at the peril of all their fortunes. That that\n noted clemency and mildness of our dominion should have been changed into such\n cruelty and inhumanity! That so many men should be condemned at one time for no\n crime! That that infamous praetor should seek for a defence for his own robberies by\n the most shameful murder of innocent men! Nothing, O judges, appears possible to be\n added to such wickedness, insanity, and barbarity—and it is true that nothing can;\n for if it be compared with the iniquity of other men it will greatly surpass it all.\n \n ",
                "115":"\n But he is his own rival; his object is always to outdo his last crime by some new\n wickedness.

Still because that young man was\n alarmed, as he saw that his case was identical with that of those men who had been\n put to death, though perfectly innocent; Timarchides came to him, and tells him that\n he is in no danger at all of being put to death, but warns him to take care lest he\n should be sentenced to be scourged. To make my story short, you heard the young man\n himself say, that because of his fear of being scourged he paid money to\n Timarchides. \n ",
                "116":"\n These are but light crimes in such a criminal as this. A naval captain of a most\n noble city ransoms himself from the danger of being scourged with a bribe—it was a\n human weakness. Another gave money to save himself from being condemned—it is a\n common thing. The Roman people does not wish Verres to be prosecuted on obsolete\n accusations; it demands new charges against him; it requires something which it has\n not heard before; it thinks that it is not a praetor of Sicily, but some most cruel\n tyrant that is being brought before the court. \n \n\n The condemned men are consigned to prison. They are sentenced to execution. Even the\n wretched parents of the naval captains are punished; they are prevented from\n visiting their sons; they are prevented from supplying their down children with food\n and raiment. \n ",

And the young men themselves also negotiated with Sextius about the same\n execution, and about that one blow; and at last, children entreated their parents to\n give money to the lictor for the sake of shortening their sufferings. Many and\n terrible sufferings have been invented for parents and relations; many—still death\n is the last of all. It shall not be. Is there any further advance that cruelty can\n make? One stall be found—for, when their children have been executed and slain,\n their bodies shall be exposed to wild beasts.

And as to this, who was there\n at Syracuse at that time, who did not\n hear, and who does not know that these bargains for permission to bury were made\n with Timarchides by the living relations of those who had been put to death?

They are executed. You rejoice and triumph at the universal misery; you\n are delighted that the witnesses of your avarice are put out of the way: you were\n mistaken, O Verres, you were greatly mistaken, when you thought that you could wash\n out the stains of your thefts and iniquities in the blood of our innocent allies.\n You were borne on headlong in your frenzy, when you thought that you could heal the\n wounds of your avarice by applying remedies of inhumanity. In truth, although those\n who were the witnesses of your wickedness are dead, yet their relations are wanting\n neither to you nor to them; yet, out of this very body of naval captains some are\n alive, and are present here; whom, as it seems to me, fortune saved out of that\n punishment of innocent men. \n ",

Dare first to deny this, if you can. No one was at\n Lilybaeum who did not see it. No one was\n in Sicily who did not hear of it.

He had spoken rather freely of the dishonesty and worthlessness of\n Verres. And as soon as he was informed of this, he orders the man to Lilybaeum to give security in a prosecution\n instituted against him by one of the slaves of Verres. He gives security. He comes\n to Lilybaeum . Verres begins to compel him,\n though no one proceeded with any action against him, though no one made any claim on\n him, to be bound over in the sum of two thousand sesterces , to appear to a charge brought against him by his own lictor,\n in the formula,—“If he had made any profit by robbery.”—He says that he will appoint\n judges out of his own retinue.

Therefore, when blood had filled his mouth and eyes, he\n fell down, and they, nevertheless, continued to beat him on the sides while lying on\n the ground, till he said at last he would give security. He, having been treated in\n this manner, was taken away from the place as dead, and, in a short time afterwards,\n he died. But that devoted servant of Venus, that man so rich in wit and politeness,\n erected a silver Cupid out of his property in the temple of Venus.

As any one of them offended his eyes or his mind, he was\n instantly thrown into the stone-quarries. I see that this appears a scandalous thing\n to you, O judges; and I had observed that, at the former pleading, when the\n witnesses stated these things; for you thought that the privileges of freedom ought\n to be maintained, not only here, where there are tribunes of the people, where there\n are other magistrates, where there is a forum with many courts of justice, where\n there is the authority of the senate, where there is the opinion of the Roman people\n to hold a man in check, where the Roman people itself is present in great numbers;\n but, in whatever country or nation the privileges of Roman citizens are violated,\n you, O judges, decide that that violation concerns the common cause of freedom, and\n of your dignity. \n ",
                "143":"\n Did you, O Verres, dare to confine such a number of Roman citizens in a prison\n built for foreigners, for wicked men, for pirates, and for enemies? Did no thoughts\n of this tribunal, or of the public assembly, or of this numerous multitude which I\n see around me, and which is now regarding you with a most hostile and inimical\n disposition, occur to your mind? Did not the dignity of the Roman people, though\n absent, did not the appearance of such a concourse as this ever present itself to\n your eyes or to your thoughts? Did you never think that you should have to return\n home to the sight of these men, that you should have to come into the forum of the\n Roman people, that you should have to submit yourself to the power of the laws and\n courts of justice? \n ",
                "144":"\n But what, O Verres, was that passion of yours for practicing cruelty? what was your\n reason for undertaking so many wicked actions? It was nothing, O judges, except a\n new and unprecedented system of plundering. For like those men whose histories we\n have learnt from the poets, who are said to have occupied some bays on the\n sea-coast, or some promontories, or some precipitous rocks, in order to be able to\n murder those who had been driven to such places in their vessels, this man also\n looked down as an enemy over every sea, from every part of Sicily . Every ship that came from Asia , from Syria , from Tyre , from\n Alexandria , was immediately seized\n by informers and guards that he could rely upon; their crews were all thrown into\n the stone-quarries; their freights and merchandise carried up into the praetor's\n house. After a long interval there was seen to range through Sicily , not another Dionysius, not another Phalaris,\n (for their island has at one time or another produced many inhuman tyrants,) but a\n new sort of monster, endowed with all the ancient savage barbarity which is said to\n have formerly existed in those same districts; \n ",
                "145":"\n for I do not think that either Scylla or Charybdis was such an enemy to sailors, as\n that man has been in the same waters. And in one respect he is far more to be\n dreaded than they, because he is girdled with more numerous and more powerful hounds\n than they were. He is a second Cyclops , far\n more savage than the first; for Verres had possession of the whole island;\n Polyphemus is said to have occupied only Aetna and that part of Sicily . But what pretext was alleged at the time by that man for this\n outrageous cruelty? The same which is now going to be stated in his defence. He used\n to say whenever any one came to Sicily a\n little better off than usual, that they were soldiers of Sertorius, and that they\n were flying from Dianium . They brought him presents to gain his protection from danger;\n some brought him Tyrian purple, others brought frankincense, perfumes, and linen\n robes; others gave jewels and pearls; some offered great bribes and Asiatic slaves,\n so that it was seen by their very goods from what place they came. They were not\n aware that those very things which they thought that they were employing as aids to\n ensure their safety, were the causes of their danger. For he would say that they had\n acquired those things by partnership with pirates, he would order the men themselves\n to be led away to the stone-quarries, he would see that their ships and their\n freights were diligently taken care of. \n ",
                "146":"\n When by these practices his prison had become full of merchants, then those scenes\n took place which you have heard related by Lucius Suetius, a Roman knight, and a\n most virtuous man, and by others. The necks of Roman citizens were broken in a most\n infamous manner in the prison; so that very expression and form of entreaty, “I am a\n Roman citizen,” which has often brought to many, in the most distant countries,\n succour and assistance, even among the barbarians, only brought to these men a more\n bitter death and a more immediate execution. What is this, O Verres? What reply are\n you thinking of making to this? That I am telling lies? that I am inventing things?\n that I am exaggerating this accusation? Will you dare to say any one of these things\n to those men who are defending you? Give me, I pray you, the documents of the\n Syracusans taken from his own bosom, which, methinks, were drawn up according to his\n will; give me the register of the prison, which is most carefully made up, stating\n in what day each individual was committed to prison, when he died, how he was\n executed.

How many wars, and what serious\n ones do you think that our ancestors undertook, because Roman citizens were said to\n have been ill-treated, or Roman vessels detained, or Roman merchants plundered? But\n I am not complaining that men have been detained; I think one might endure their\n having been plundered; I am impeaching Verres because after their ships, their\n slaves, and their merchandise had been taken from them, the merchants themselves\n were thrown into prison—because Roman citizens were imprisoned and executed. \n ",

For so great is\n the dignity of this empire, so great is the honour in which the Roman name is held\n among all nations, that the exercise of such cruelty towards our citizens seems to\n be permitted to no one.

Accordingly, Gavius is at once brought before the Mamertine\n magistrates; and, as it happened, Verres came on that very day to Messana . The matter is brought before him. He is\n told that the man was a Roman citizen, who was complaining that at Syracuse he had been confined in the\n stone-quarries, and who, when he was actually embarking on board ship, and uttering\n violent threats against Verres, had been brought back by them, and reserved in order\n that he himself might decide what should be done with him. \n ",

He\n not only did not succeed in averting by his entreaties the violence of the rods, but\n as he kept on repeating his entreaties and the assertion of his citizenship, a\n cross—a cross I say—was got ready for that miserable man, who had never witnessed\n such a stretch of power. \n ",

I do not ask you what were your grounds for that\n suspicion, I impeach you by your own words. He said that he was a Roman citizen. If\n you, O Verres, being taken among the Persians or in the remotest parts of India , were being led to execution, what else would\n you cry out but that you were a Roman citizen? And if that name of your city,\n honoured and renowned as it is among all men, would have availed you, a stranger\n among strangers, among barbarians, among men placed in the most remote and distant\n corners of the earth, ought not he, whoever he was, whom you were hurrying to the\n cross, who was a stranger to you, to have been able, when he said that he was a\n Roman citizen, to obtain from you, the praetor, if not an escape, at least a respite\n from death by his mention of and claims to citizenship? \n ",

And accordingly, O judges, that cross, for the first time since the foundation\n of Messana , was erected in that place. A\n spot commanding a view of Italy was picked\n out by that man, for the express purpose that the wretched man who was dying in\n agony and torture might see that the rights of liberty and of slavery were only\n separated by a very narrow strait, and that Italy might behold her son murdered by the most miserable and most\n painful punishment appropriate to slaves alone. \n ",

Yet with all this that man was not content. “Let him behold his country,” said\n he; “let him die within sight of laws and liberty.” It was not Gavius, it was not\n one individual, I know not whom,—it was not one Roman citizen,—it was the common\n cause of freedom and citizenship that you exposed to that torture and nailed on that\n cross. But now consider the audacity of the man. Do not you think that he was\n indignant that be could not erect that cross for Roman citizens in the forum, in the\n comitium, in the very rostra?

They think that all their privileges, all their\n advantages, all their defences, in short their whole liberty, depends on your\n sentence. \n ",
                "172":"\n From me, although they have already had aid enough, still, if the affair should\n turn out ill, they will perhaps have more than the venture to ask for. For even\n though any violence should snatch that man from your severity, which I do not fear,\n a judges, nor do I think it by any means possible; still, if my expectations should\n in this deceive me, the Sicilians will complain that their cause is lost, and they\n will be as indignant as I shall myself; yet the Roman people, in a short time, since\n it has given me the power of pleading before them, shall through my exertions\n recover its rights by its own votes before the beginning of February. And if you\n have any anxiety, O judges, for my honour and for my renown, it is not unfavourable\n for my interests, that that man, having been saved from me at this trial, should be\n reserved for that decision of the Roman people. The cause is a splendid one, one\n easily to be proved by me, very acceptable and agreeable to the Roman people.\n Lastly, if I see where to have wished to rise at the expense of that one man, which\n I have not wished,—if he should be acquitted, (a thing which cannot happen without\n the wickedness of many men,) I shall be enabled to rise at the expense of many.\n \n \n But in truth, for your sake, O judges, and for\n the sake of the republic, I should grieve that such a crime was committed by this\n select bench of judges. I should grieve that those judges, whom I have myself\n approved of and joined in selecting, should walk about in this city branded with\n such disgrace by that man being acquitted, as to seem smeared not with wax, but with\n mud. \n ",
                "173":"\n Wherefore, from this place I warn you also, O Hortensius, if there is any room for\n giving a warning, to take care again and again, and to consider what you are doing,\n and whither you are proceeding; what man it is whom you are defending, and by what\n means you are doing so. Nor in this manner do I seek at all to limit you, so as to\n prevent your contending against me with all your genius, and all your ability in\n speaking. As to other things, if you think that you can secretly manage, out of\n court, some of the things which belong to this judicial trial; if you think that you\n can effect anything by artifice, by cunning, by influence, by your own popularity,\n by that man's wealth; then I am strongly of opinion you had better abandon that\n idea. And I warn you rather to put down, I warn you not to suffer to proceed any\n further the attempts which have already been commenced by that man, but which have\n been thoroughly detected by, and are thoroughly known to me. It will be at a great\n risk to yourself that any error is committed in this trial; at a greater risk than\n you think. \n ",
                "174":"\n For as for your thinking yourself now relieved from all fear for your reputation,\n and at the summit of all honour as consul elect, believe me, it is no less laborious\n a task to preserve those honours and kindnesses, conferred on you by the Roman\n people, than to acquire them. This city has borne as long as it could, as long as\n there was no help for it, that kingly sort of sway of yours which you have exercised\n in the courts of justice, and in every part of the republic. It has borne it, I say.\n But on the day when the tribunes of the people were restored to the Roman people,\n all those privileges (if you are not yourself already aware of it) were taken away\n from you. At this very time the eyes of all men are directed on each individual\n among us, to see with what good faith I prosecute him, with what scrupulous justice\n these men judge him, in what manner you defend him. \n ",
                "175":"\n And in the case of all of us, if any one of us turns aside ever so little from the\n right path, there will follow, not that silent opinion of men which you were\n formerly accustomed to despise, but a severe and fearless judgment of the Roman\n people. You have, O Quintus, no relationship, no connection with that man. In the\n case of this man you can have none of those excuses with which you formerly used to\n defend your excessive zeal in any trial. You are bound to take care above all\n things, that the things which that fellow used to say in the province, when he said\n that he did all that he was doing out of his confidence in you, shall not be thought\n to be true. \n ",
                "176":"\n I feel sure now that I have discharged my duty to the satisfaction of all those who\n are most unfavourable to me. For I convicted him, in the few hours which the first\n pleading occupied, in the opinion of every man. The remainder of the trial is not\n now about my good faith, which has been amply proved, nor about that fellow's way of\n life, which has bean fully condemned; but it is the judges, and if I am to tell the\n truth, it is yourself, who will now be passed sentence on. But when will that\n sentence be passed? For that is a point that must be much looked to, since in all\n things, and especially in state affairs, the consideration of time and circumstance\n is of the greatest importance. Why, at that time when the Roman people shall demand\n another class of men, another order of citizens to act as judges. Sentence will be\n pronounced in deciding on that law about new judges and fresh tribunals which has\n been proposed in reality not by the man whose name you see on the back of it, but by\n this defendant. Verres, I say, has contrived to have this law drawn up and proposed\n from the hope and opinion which he entertains of you. \n ",
                "177":"\n Therefore, when this cause was first commenced, that law had not been proposed;\n when Verres, alarmed at your impartiality, had given many indications that he was\n not likely to make any reply at all, still no mention was made of that law; when he\n seemed to pick up a little courage and to fortify himself with some little hope,\n immediately this law was proposed. And as your dignity is exceedingly inconsistent\n with this law, so his false hopes and preeminent impudence are strongly in favour of\n it. In this case, if anything blameworthy be done by any of you, either the Roman\n people itself will judge that man whom it has already pronounced unworthy of any\n trial at all; or else those men will judge, who, because of the unpopularity of the\n existing tribunals, will be appointed as new judges by a new law made respecting the\n old judges. \n ",
                "178":"\n For myself, even though I were not to say it myself, who is there who is not aware\n how far it is necessary for me to proceed? Will it be possible for me to be silent,\n O Hortensius? Will it be possible for me to dissemble, when the republic has\n received so severe a wound, that, though I pleaded the cause, our provinces will\n appear to have been pillaged, our allies oppressed, the immortal gods plundered,\n Roman citizens tortured and murdered with impunity? Will it be possible for me\n either to lay this burden on the shoulders of this tribunal, or any longer to endure\n it in silence? Must not the matter be agitated? must it not be brought publicly\n forward? Must not the good faith of the Roman people be implored? Must not all who\n have implicated themselves in such wickedness as to allow their good faith to be\n tampered with, or to give a corrupt decision, be summoned before the court, and made\n to encounter a public trial? \n ",
                "179":"\n Perhaps some one will ask, Are you then going to take upon yourself such a labour,\n and such violent enmity from so many quarters? Not, of a truth, from any desire of\n mine, or of my own free will. But I have not the same liberty allowed me that they\n have who are born of noble family; on whom even when they are asleep all the honours\n of the Roman people are showered. I must live in this city on far other terms and\n other conditions. For the case of Marcus Cato, a most wise and active man, occurs to\n me; who, as he thought that it was better to be recommended to the Roman people by\n virtue than by high birth, and as he wished that the foundation of his race and name\n should be hid and extended by himself, voluntarily encountered the enmity of most\n influential men, and lived in the discharge of the greatest labours to an extreme\n old age with great credit. \n ",
                "180":"\n After that, did not Quintus Pompeius, a man born in a low and obscure rank of life,\n gain the very highest honours by encountering the enmity of many, and great personal\n danger, and by undertaking great labour? And lately we have seen Caius Fimbria,\n Caius Marcius, and Caius Caelius, striving with no slight toil, and in spite of no\n insignificant opposition, to arrive at those honours which you nobles arrive at\n while devoted to amusement or absorbed in indifference. This is the system, this is\n the path for our adoption. These are the men whose conduct and principles we follow.\n \n \n We see how unpopular with, and how hateful to\n some men of noble birth, is the virtue and industry of new men; that, if we only\n turn our eyes away for a moment, snares are laid for us; that, if we give the least\n room for suspicion or for accusation, an attack is immediately made on us; that we\n must be always vigilant, always labouring. Are there any enmities?—let them be\n encountered; any toils?—Let them be undertaken. \n ",
                "181":"\n In truth, silent and secret enmities are more to be dreaded than war openly\n declared and waged against us. There's scarcely one man of noble birth who looks\n favourably on our industry; there are no services of ours by which we can secure\n their good-will; they differ from us in disposition and inclination, as if they were\n of a different race and a different nature. What danger then is there to us in their\n enmity, when their dispositions are already averse and inimical to us before we have\n at all provoked their enmity? \n ",
                "182":"\n Wherefore, O judges, I earnestly wish that I may appear for the last time in the\n character of an accuser, in the case of this criminal, when I shall have given\n satisfaction to the Roman people, and discharged the duty due to the Sicilians my\n client, and which I have voluntarily undertaken. But it is my deliberate resolution,\n if the event should deceive the expectation which I cherish of you, to prosecute not\n only those who are particularly implicated in the guilt of corrupting the tribunal,\n but those also who have in any way been accomplices in it. Moreover, if there be any\n persons, who in the case of the criminal have any inclination to show themselves\n powerful, or audacious, or ingenious in corrupting the tribunal, let them hold\n themselves ready, seeing that they will have to fight a battle with us, while the\n Roman people will be the judges of the contest. And if they know that, in the case\n of this criminal, whom the Sicilian nation has given me for my enemy, I have been\n sufficiently energetic, sufficiently persevering, and sufficiently vigilant, they\n may conceive that I shall be a much more formidable and active enemy to those men\n whose enmity I have encountered of my own accord, for the sake of the Roman people.\n \n ",
                "183":"\n Now, O good and great Jupiter , you, whose\n royal present, worthy of your most splendid temple, worthy of the Capitol and of\n that citadel of all nations, worthy of being the gift of a king, made for you by a\n king, dedicated and promised to you, that man by his nefarious wickedness wrested\n from the hands of a monarch; you whose most holy and most beautiful image he carried\n away from Syracuse ;—And you, O royal\n Juno, whose two temples, situated in two islands of our allies—at Melita and Samos—temples of the greatest sanctity\n and the greatest antiquity, that same man, with similar wickedness, stripped of all\n their presents and ornaments;—And you, O Minerva, whom he also pillaged in two of\n your most renowned and most venerated temples—at Athens , when he took away a great quantity of gold, and at Syracuse , when he took away everything except\n the roof and walls;— \n ",
                "184":"\n And you, O Latona , O Apollo, O Diana, whose\n (I will not say temples, but, as the universal opinion and religious belief agrees,)\n ancient birthplace and divine home at Delos \n he plundered by a nocturnal robbery and attack;—You, also, O Apollo, whose image he\n carried away from Chios ;—You, again and\n again, O Diana, whom he plundered at Perga; whose most holy image at Segesta , where it had been twice\n consecrated—once by their own religious gift, and a second time by the victory of\n Publius Africanus—he dared to take away and remove;—And you, O Mercury, whom Verres\n had placed in his villa, and in some private palaestra, but whom Publius Africanus\n had placed in a city of the allies. and in the gymnasium of the Tyndaritans, as a\n guardian and protector of the youth of the city;— \n ",
                "185":"\n And you, O Hercules, whom that man endeavoured, on a stormy night, with a band of\n slaves properly equipped and armed, to tear down from your situation, and to carry\n off;—And you, O most holy mother Cybele, whom he left among the Enguini, in your\n most august and venerated temple, plundered to such an extent, that the name only of\n Africanus, and some traces of your worship thus violated, remain, but the monuments\n of victory and all the ornaments of the temple are no longer visible,—You, also, O\n you judges and witnesses of all forensic matters, and of the most important\n tribunals, and of the laws, and of the courts of justice,—you, placed in the most\n frequented place belonging to the Roman people, O Castor and Pollux, from whose\n temple that man, in a most wicked manner, procured gain to himself, and enormous\n booty;—And, O all ye gods, who, borne on sacred cars, visit the solemn assemblies of\n our games, whose road that fellow contrived should be adapted, not to the dignity of\n your religious ceremonies, but to his own profit; \n ",
                "186":"\n —And you, O Ceres and Libera, whose sacred\n worship, as the opinions and religious belief of all men agree, is contained in the\n most important and most abstruse mysteries; you, by whom the principles of life and\n food, the examples of laws, customs, humanity, and refinement are said to have been\n given and distributed to nations and to cities; you, whose sacred rites the Roman\n people has received from the Greeks and adopted, and now preserves with such\n religious awe, both publicly and privately, that they seem not to have been\n introduced from other nations, but rather to nave been transmitted from hence to\n other nations, but which nave been polluted and violated by that man alone, in such\n a manner, that he had one image of Ceres \n (which it was impious for a man not only to touch, but even to look upon) pulled\n down from its place in the temple at Catina , and taken away; and another image of whom he carried away from\n its proper seat and home at Enna ; which was\n a work of such beauty, that men, when they saw it, thought either that they saw\n Ceres herself, or an image of\n Ceres not wrought by human hand, but one\n that had fallen from heaven;— \n ",
                "187":"\n You, again and again I implore and appeal to, most holy goddesses, who dwell around\n those lakes and groves of Enna , and who\n preside over all Sicily , which is entrusted\n to me to be defended; you whose invention and gift of corn, which you have\n distributed over the whole earth, inspires all nations and all races of men with\n reverence for your divine power;—And all the other gods, and all the goddesses, do I\n implore and entreat, against whose temples and religious worship that man, inspired\n by some wicked frenzy and audacity, has always waged a sacrilegious and impious war,\n that, if in dealing with this criminal and this cause my counsels have always tended\n to the safety of the allies, the dignity of the Roman people, and the maintenance of\n my own character for good faith; if all my cares, and vigilance, and thoughts have\n been directed to nothing but the discharge of my duty, and the establishment of\n truth, I implore them, O judges, so to influence you, that the thoughts which were\n mine when I undertook this cause, the good faith which has been mine in pleading it,\n may be yours also in deciding it. \n ",
                "188":"\n Lastly, that, if all the actions of Caius Verres are unexampled and unheard of\n instances of wickedness, of audacity, of perfidy, of lust, of avarice, and of\n cruelty, an end worthy of such a life and such actions may, by your sentence,\n overtake him; and that the republic, and my own duty to it, may be content with my\n undertaking this one prosecution, and that I may be allowed for the future to defend\n the good, instead of being compelled to prosecute the infamous. \n "
