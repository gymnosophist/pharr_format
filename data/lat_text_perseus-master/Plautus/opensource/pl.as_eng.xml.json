The latter has made an agreement with a Captain, of the name of Diabolus, to transfer Philenium to him for twenty min, on condition, however, that if Argyrippus shall first pay that sum, he shall have her. Argyrippus, having exhausted all his own resources, applies to his father, Demnetus, an over-indulgent and immoral old man, and requests him to furnish him with twenty min. Demnetus is married to Artemona, a rich woman, and is totally dependant on the will of herself and her favourite slave, the chamberlain Saurea. Being destitute of money, Demnetus orders his servant, Libanus, by some means or other to cheat his mistress or the chamberlain out of that sum. Just then an ass-dealer arrives, to pay to Saurea twenty min, the price of some asses which he has previously purchased. Libanus then arranges with his fellow-servant, Leonida, that the latter shall personate Saurea, and so receive the money from the ass-dealer. This is done, and the money is paid to Leonida, in the presence of Demnetus, who assures the dealer that Leonida really is the person to whom the money is payable. This sum is then given to Argyrippus, but with the disgraceful stipulation that for one day his father shall enjoy the company of Philenium. This he submits to, and the three sit down to a banquet. The Captain discovers this, and sends his Parasite to inform Artemona of her husband's conduct. She accordingly accompanies the Parasite, and discovers her husband in the company of his son and the young woman; after soundly rating him, she leads him off; while Argyrippus remains in possession of Philenium."}}, {"@type": "scene", "@n": "argument", "head": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@place": "inline", "#text": "[Supposed to have been written by Priscian the Grammarian.]"}, "#text": "THE ACROSTIC ARGUMENT."}, "sp": {"speaker": "THE ASS-DEALER.", "p": {"foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "Amanti"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Sub"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Itaque"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "in payment"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Nulerari"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Ad"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "and"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "to his father."}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Rivinus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "is"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Is"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Adcurrit"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "to the place,"}], "#text": "son in love (), the old man, who lives under () his wife's control, wishes to help him with money; therefore (), some money that has been brought  for the asses for Saurea he orders to be paid () to his servant Leonida.
