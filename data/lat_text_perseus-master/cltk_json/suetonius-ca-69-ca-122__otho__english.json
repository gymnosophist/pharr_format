        "0":"\n\t\t\t\t THE ancestors of Otho were originally of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe town of Ferentum, of an ancient and honourable family, and, indeed, one of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe most considerable in Etruria. His grandfather, M. Salvius Otho (whose father\n\t\t\t\t\twas a Roman knight, but his mother of mean extraction, for it is not certain\n\t\t\t\t\twhether she was free-born), by the favour of Livia Augusta, in whose house he\n\t\t\t\t\thad his education, was made a senator, but never rose higher than the\n\t\t\t\t\tpraetorship. His father, Lucius Otho, was by the mother's side nobly descended,\n\t\t\t\t\tallied to several great families, and so dearly beloved by Tiberius , and so much resembled him in his\n\t\t\t\t\tfeatures, that most people believed Tiberius was his father. He behaved with great strictness and\n\t\t\t\t\tseverity, not only in the city offices, but in the pro-consulship of Africa , and some extraordinary commands in the\n\t\t\t\t\tarmy. He had the courage to punish with death some soldiers in Illyricum , who, in the disturbance attempted\n\t\t\t\t\tby Camillus , upon changing their minds,\n\t\t\t\t\thad put their generals to the sword, as promoters of that insurrection against\n\t\t\t\t\tClaudius. He ordered the execution to take place in the front of the camp, and under\n\t\t\t\t\this own eyes; though he knew they had been advanced to higher ranks in the army\n\t\t\t\t\tby Claudius, on that very account. By this action he acquired fame, but lessened\n\t\t\t\t\this favour at court; which, however, he soon recovered, by discovering to\n\t\t\t\t\tClaudius a design upon his life, carried on by a Roman knight, and which he had learnt from some of his slaves. For the senate ordered\n\t\t\t\t\ta statue of him to be erected in the palace; an honour which had been conferred\n\t\t\t\t\tbut upon very few before him. And Claudius advanced him to the dignity of a\n\t\t\t\t\tpatrician, commending him, at the same time, in the highest terms, and\n\t\t\t\t\tconcluding with these words: \" A man, than whom I don't so much as wish to have\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren that should be better.\" He had two sons by a very noble woman, Albia\n\t\t\t\t\tTerentia, namely, Lucius Titianus, and a younger called Marcus, who had the same\n\t\t\t\t\tcognomen as himself. He had also a daughter, whom he contracted to Drusus,\n\t\t\t\t\tGermanicus's son, before she was of marriageable age. \n\t\t\t",
        "1":"\n\t\t\t\t The emperor Otho was born upon the fourth of the calends of May [28th April], in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe consulship of Camillus Aruntius and Domitius Aenobarbus. He was from his earliest youth\n\t\t\t\t\tso riotous and wild, that he was often severely scourged by his father. He was\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid to run about in the night-time, and seize upon any one he met, who was\n\t\t\t\t\teither drunk or too feeble to mal e resistance, and toss him in a blanket. After\n\t\t\t\t\this father's death, to make his court more effectually to a freedwoman about the\n\t\t\t\t\tpalace, who was in great favour, he pretended to be in love with her, though she\n\t\t\t\t\twas old and almost decrepit. Having by her means got into Nero 's good graces, he soon became one of the\n\t\t\t\t\tprincipal favourites, by the congeniality of his disposition to that of the\n\t\t\t\t\temperor. He had so great a sway at court, that when a man of consular rank was\n\t\t\t\t\tcondemned for bribery, having tampered with him for a large sum of money, to\n\t\t\t\t\tprocure his pardon; before he had quite effected it, he scrupled not to\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduce him into the senate, to return his thanks. \n\t\t\t",
        "2":"\n\t\t\t\t Having by means of this woman, insinuated himself into all the emperor's secrets,\n\t\t\t\t\the, upon the day designed for the murder of his mother, entertained them both at\n\t\t\t\t\ta very splendid feast, to prevent suspicion. Poppaea Sabina, for whom Nero entertained such a violent passion that\n\t\t\t\t\the had taken her from her husband and entrusted her to him, he received, and went through the form of\n\t\t\t\t\tmarrying her. And not satisfied with obtaining her favour, he loved her so\n\t\t\t\t\textravagantly, that he could not with patience bear Nero for his rival. It is\n\t\t\t\t\tcertainly believed that he not only refused admittance to those who were sent by\n\t\t\t\t\tNero to fetch her, but that, on one occasion, he shut him out, and kept him\n\t\t\t\t\tstanding before the door, mixing prayers and menaces in vain, and demanding back\n\t\t\t\t\tagain what was entrusted to his keeping. His pretended marriage, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing dissolved, he was sent lieutenant into Lusitania . This treatment of him was thought sufficiently\n\t\t\t\t\tsevere, because harsher proceedings might have brought the whole farce to light,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich notwithstanding, at last came out, and was published to the world in the\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowing distich: Cur Otho mentitus sit, quaeritis,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\texul honore? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Uxoris moechus cseperat esse suae. \n\t\t\t\t\t You ask why Otho's banish'd? Know, the cause \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Comes not within the verge of vulgar laws, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Against all rules of fashionable life, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The rogue had dared to sleep with his own wife. He governed\n\t\t\t\t\tthe province in quality of quaestor for ten years, with singular moderation and\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice. \n\t\t\t",
        "3":"\n\t\t\t\t As soon as an opportunity of revenge offered, he readily joined in Galba's\n\t\t\t\t\tenterprises, and at the same time conceived hopes of obtaining the imperial\n\t\t\t\t\tdignity for himself. To this he was much encouraged by the state of the times,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut still more by the assurances given him by Seleucus, the astrologer, who,\n\t\t\t\t\thaving formerly told him that he would certainly out-live Nero , came to him at that juncture\n\t\t\t\t\tunexpectedly, promising him again that he should succeed in the empire, and that\n\t\t\t\t\tin a very short time. He, therefore, let slip no opportunity of making his court\n\t\t\t\t\tto every one about him by all manner of civilities. As often as he entertained\n\t\t\t\t\tGalba at supper, he distributed to every man of the cohort which attended the\n\t\t\t\t\temperor on guard, a gold piece; endeavouring likewise to oblige the rest of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers in one way or another. Being chosen an arbitrator by one who had a\n\t\t\t\t\tdispute with his neighbour about a piece of land, he bought it, and gave it to\n\t\t\t\t\thim; so that now almost every body thought and said, that he was the only man\n\t\t\t\t\tworthy of succeeding to the empire. \n\t\t\t",
        "4":"\n\t\t\t\t He entertained hopes of being adopted by Galba, and expected it every day. But\n\t\t\t\t\tfinding himself disappointed. by Piso's being preferred before him, he turned\n\t\t\t\t\this thoughts to obtaining his purpose by the use of violence; and to this he was\n\t\t\t\t\tinstigated, as well by the greatness of his debts, as by resentment at Galba's\n\t\t\t\t\tconduct towards him. For he did not conceal his conviction, \"that he could not\n\t\t\t\t\tstand his ground unless he became emperor, and that it signified nothing whether\n\t\t\t\t\the fell by the hands of his enemies in the field, or of his creditors in the\n\t\t\t\t\tforum.\" He had a few days before squeezed out of one of the emperor's slaves a\n\t\t\t\t\tmillion of sesterces for procuring him a stewardship; and this was the whole\n\t\t\t\t\tfund he had for carrying on so great an enterprise. At first the design was\n\t\t\t\t\tentrusted to only five of the guard, but afterward to ten others, each of the\n\t\t\t\t\tfive naming two. They had every one ten thousand sesterces paid down, and were\n\t\t\t\t\tpromised fifty thousand more. By these, others were drawn in, but not many; from\n\t\t\t\t\ta confident assurance, that when the matter came to the crisis, they should have\n\t\t\t\t\tenough to join them. \n\t\t\t",
        "5":"\n\t\t\t\t His first intention was, immediately after the departure of Piso, to seize the\n\t\t\t\t\tcamp, and fall upon Galba whilst he was at supper in the palace; but he was\n\t\t\t\t\trestrained by a regard for the cohort at that time on duty, lest he should bring\n\t\t\t\t\ttoo great an odium upon it; because it happened that the same cohort was on\n\t\t\t\t\tguard before, both when Caius was slain, and Nero deserted. For some time\n\t\t\t\t\tafterwards, he was restrained also by scruples about the omens, and by the\n\t\t\t\t\tadvice of Seleucus. Upon the day fixed at last for the enterprise, having given\n\t\t\t\t\this accomplices notice to wait for him in the forum near the temple of Saturn,\n\t\t\t\t\tat the gilded mile-stone, he went in the morning to pay his respects to Galba; and\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing received with a kiss as usual, he attended him at sacrifice, and heard the\n\t\t\t\t\tpredictions of the augur. A freedman of his, then bringing him word that the\n\t\t\t\t\tarchitects were come, which was the signal agreed upon, he withdrew, as if it\n\t\t\t\t\twere with a design to view a house upon sale, and went out by a back-door of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpalace to the place appointed. Some say he pretended to be seized with an ague\n\t\t\t\t\tfit, and ordered those about him to make that excuse for him, if he was inquired\n\t\t\t\t\tafter. Being then quickly concealed in a woman's litter, he made the best of his\n\t\t\t\t\tway for the camp. But the bearers growing tired, he got out, and began to run.\n\t\t\t\t\tHis shoe becoming loose, he stopped again, but being immediately raised by his\n\t\t\t\t\tattendants upon their shoulders, and unanimously saluted by the fitle of\n\t\t\t\t\tEMPEROR, he came amidst auspicious acclamations and drawn swords into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrincipia in the camp; all who met him joining in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcavalcade, as if they had been privy to the design. Upon this, sending some\n\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers to dispatch Galba and Piso, he said nothing else in his address to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsoldiery, to secure their affections, than these few words: \",I shall be content\n\t\t\t\t\twith whatever ye think fit to leave me.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "6":"\n\t\t\t\t Towards the close of the day, he entered the senate, and after he had made a\n\t\t\t\t\tshort speech to them, pretending that he had been seized in the streets, and\n\t\t\t\t\tcompelled by violence to assume the imperial authority, which he designed to\n\t\t\t\t\texercise in conjunction with them, he retired to the palace Besides other\n\t\t\t\t\tcompliments which he received from those who flocked about him to congratulate\n\t\t\t\t\tand flatter him, he was called Nero by the mob, and manifested no intention of\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclining that cognomen. Nay, some authors relate, that he used it in his\n\t\t\t\t\tofficial acts, and the first letters he sent to the governors of provinces. He\n\t\t\t\t\tsuffered all his images and statues to be replaced, and restored his procurators\n\t\t\t\t\tand freedmen to their former posts. And the first writing which he signed as\n\t\t\t\t\temperor, was a promise of fifty millions of sesterces to finish the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGolden-house. He\n\t\t\t\t\tis said to have been greatly frightened that night in his sleep, and to have\n\t\t\t\t\tgroaned heavily; and being found, by those who came running in to see what the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter was, lying upon the floor before his bed, he endeavoured by every kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tatonement to appease the ghost of Galba, by which he had found himself violently\n\t\t\t\t\ttumbled out of bed. The next day, as he was taking the omens, a great storm\n\t\t\t\t\tarising, and sustaining a grievous fall, he muttered to himself from time to\n\t\t\t\t\ttime: τί γαρ \n\t\t\t\t\t What business have I the loud trumpets to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsound? \n\t\t\t",
        "7":"\n\t\t\t\t About the same time, the armies in Germany took an oath to Vitellius as emperor. Upon receiving\n\t\t\t\t\tthis intelligence, he advised the senate to send thither deputies, to inform\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, that a prince had been already chosen; and to persuade them to peace and a\n\t\t\t\t\tgood understanding. By letters and messengers, however, he offered Vitellius to\n\t\t\t\t\tmake him his colleague in the empire, and his son-in-law. But a war being now\n\t\t\t\t\tunavoidable, and the generals and troops sent forward by Vitellius, advancing,\n\t\t\t\t\the had a proof of the attachment and fidelity of the pretorian guards, which had\n\t\t\t\t\tnearly proved fatal to the senatorian order. It had been judged proper that some\n\t\t\t\t\tarms should be given out of the stores, and conveyed to the fleet by the marine\n\t\t\t\t\ttroops. While they were employed in fetching these from the camp in the night,\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of the guards suspecting treachery, excited a tumult; and suddenly the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole body, without any of their officers at their head, ran to the palace,\n\t\t\t\t\tdemanding that the entire senate should be put to the sword; and having repulsed\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of the tribunes who endeavoured to stop them, and slain others, they broke,\n\t\t\t\t\tall bloody as they were, into the banquetting room, inquiring for the emperor;\n\t\t\t\t\tnor would they quit the place until they had seen him. He now entered upon his\n\t\t\t\t\texpedition against Vitellius with great alacrity, but too much precipitation,\n\t\t\t\t\tand without any regard to the ominous circumstances which attended it. \n\t\t\t\t For the Ancilia had been\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken out of the temple of Mars, for the usual procession, but were not yet\n\t\t\t\t\treplaced; during which interval it had of old been looked upon as very\n\t\t\t\t\tunfortunate to engage in any enterprise. He likewise set forward upon the day\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the worshippers of the Mother of the gods begin their lamentations and wailing.\n\t\t\t\t\tBesides these, other unlucky omens attended him, For, in a victim offered to\n\t\t\t\t\tFather Dis, he found the signs such as upon all other occasions are\n\t\t\t\t\tregarded as favourable; whereas, in that sacrifice, the contrary intimations are\n\t\t\t\t\tjudged the most propitious. At his first setting forward, he was stopped by\n\t\t\t\t\tinundations of the Tiber ; and at twenty\n\t\t\t\t\tmiles' distance from the city, found the road blocked up by the fall of\n\t\t\t\t\thouses. \n\t\t\t",
        "8":"\n\t\t\t\t Though it was the general opinion that it would be proper to protract the war, as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe enemy were distressed by famine and the straitness of their quarters, yet he\n\t\t\t\t\tresolved with equal rashness to force them to an engagement as soon as possible;\n\t\t\t\t\twhether from impatience of prolonged anxiety, and in the hope of bringing\n\t\t\t\t\tmatters to an issue before the arrival of Vitellius, or because he could not\n\t\t\t\t\tresist the ardour of the troops, who were all clamorous for battle. He was not,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, present at any of those which ensued, but stayed behind at Brixellum . He had the advantage\n\t\t\t\t\tin three slight engagements, near the Alps , about Placentia , and a place called Castor's; but was, by a fraudulent stratagem of the\n\t\t\t\t\tenemy, defeated in the last and greatest battle at Bedriacum. For, some hopes of a\n\t\t\t\t\tconference being given, and the soldiers being drawn up to hear the conditions\n\t\t\t\t\tof peace declared, very unexpectedly, and amidst their mutual salutations, they\n\t\t\t\t\twere obliged to stand to their arms. Immediately upon this he determined to put\n\t\t\t\t\tan end to his life, more, as many think, and not without reason, out of shame,\n\t\t\t\t\tat persisting in a struggle for the empire to the hazard of the public interest\n\t\t\t\t\tand so many lives, than from despair, or distrust of his troops. For he had\n\t\t\t\t\tstill in reserve, and in full force, those whom he had kept about him for a\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond trial of his fortune, and others were coming up from Dalmatia , Pannonia , and Moesia ;\n\t\t\t\t\tnor were the troops lately defeated so far discouraged as not to be ready, even\n\t\t\t\t\tof themselves, to run all risks in order to wipe off their recent disgrace. \n\t\t\t",
        "9":"\n\t\t\t\t My father, Suetonius Lenis, was in this\n\t\t\t\t\tbattle, being at that time an angusticlavian tribune in the thirteenth legion.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe used frequently to say, that Otho, before his advancement to the empire, had\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch an abhorrence of civil war, that once, upon hearing an account given at\n\t\t\t\t\ttable of the death of Cassius and Brutus, he fell into a trembling, and that he\n\t\t\t\t\tneverwould have interfered with Galba, but that he was confident of succeeding\n\t\t\t\t\tin his enterprise without a war. Moreover, that he was then encouraged to\n\t\t\t\t\tdespise life by the example of a common soldier, who bringing news of the defeat\n\t\t\t\t\tof the army, and finding that he met with no credit, but was railed at for a\n\t\t\t\t\tliar and a coward, as if he had run away from the field of battle, fell upon his\n\t\t\t\t\tsword at the emperor's feet; upon the sight of which, my father said that Otho\n\t\t\t\t\tcried out, \" that he would expose to no farther danger such brave men, who had\n\t\t\t\t\tdeserved so well at his hands.\" Advising therefore his brother, his brother's\n\t\t\t\t\tson, and the rest of his friends, to provide for their security in the best\n\t\t\t\t\tmanner they could, after he had embraced and kissed them, he sent them away; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthem withdrawing into a private room by himself, he wrote a letter of\n\t\t\t\t\tconsolation to his sister, containing two sheets. He likewise sent another to\n\t\t\t\t\tMessalina, Nero's widow, whom he had intended to marry, committing her the care\n\t\t\t\t\tof his relics and memory. He then burnt all the letters which he had by him, to\n\t\t\t\t\tprevent the danger and mischief that might otherwise befall the writers from the\n\t\t\t\t\tconqueror. What ready money he had, he distributed among his domestics. \n\t\t\t",
        "10":"\n\t\t\t\t And now being prepared, and just upon the point of dispatching himself, he was\n\t\t\t\t\tinduced to suspend the execution of his purpose by a great tumult which had\n\t\t\t\t\tbroken out in the camp. Finding that some of the soldiers who were making off\n\t\t\t\t\thad been seized and detained as deserters, \" Let us add,\" said he, \" this night\n\t\t\t\t\tto our life.\" These were his very words. He then gave orders that no violence\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be offered to any one; and keeping his chamber-door open until late at\n\t\t\t\t\tnight, he allowed all who pleased the liberty to come and see him. At last,\n\t\t\t\t\tafter quenching his thirst with a draught of cold water, he took up two\n\t\t\t\t\tponiards, and having examined the points of both, put one of them under his\n\t\t\t\t\tpillow, and shutting his chamber-door, slept very soundly, until, awaking about\n\t\t\t\t\tbreak of day. he stabbed himself under the left pap. Some persons bursting into\n\t\t\t\t\tthe room upon his first groan, he at one time covered, and at another exposed\n\t\t\t\t\this wound to the view of the bystanders, and thus life soon ebbed away. His\n\t\t\t\t\tfuneral was hastily performed, according to his own order, in the thirty-eighth\n\t\t\t\t\tyear of his age, and ninety-fifth day of his reign. \n\t\t\t",
        "11":"\n\t\t\t\t The person and appearance of Otho no way corresponded to the great spirit he\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplayed on this occasion; for he is said to have been of low stature,\n\t\t\t\t\tsplayfooted, and bandy-legged. He was, however, effeminately nice in the care of\n\t\t\t\t\this person: the hair on his body he plucked out by the roots; and because he was\n\t\t\t\t\tsomewhat bald, he wore a kind of peruke, so exactly fitted to his head, that\n\t\t\t\t\tnobody could have known it for such. He used to shave every day, and rub his\n\t\t\t\t\tface with soaked bread; the use of which he began when the down first appeared\n\t\t\t\t\tupon his chin, to prevent his having any beard. It is said likewise that he\n\t\t\t\t\tcelebrated publicly the sacred rites of Isis, clad in a linen garment, such as is used by the worshippers of that\n\t\t\t\t\tgoddess. These circumstances, I imagine, caused the world to wonder the more\n\t\t\t\t\tthat his death was so little in character with his life. Many of the soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\twho were present, kissing and bedewing with their tears his hands and feet as he\n\t\t\t\t\tlay dead, and celebrating him as \"a most gallant man, and an incomparable\n\t\t\t\t\temperor,\" immediately put an end to their own lives upon the spot, not far from\n\t\t\t\t\this funeral pile. Many of those likewise who were at a distance, upon hearing\n\t\t\t\t\tthe news of his death, in the anguish of their hearts, began fighting amongst\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves, until they dispatched one another. To conclude: the generality of\n\t\t\t\t\tmankind, though they hated him whilst living, yet highly extolled him after his\n\t\t\t\t\tdeath; insomuch that it was the common talk and opinion, \"that Galba had been\n\t\t\t\t\tdriven to destruction by his rival, not so much for the sake of reigning\n\t\t\t\t\thimself, as of restoring Rome to its\n\t\t\t\t\tancient liberty.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "12":"\n\t\t\t\t Remarks on Otho \n\t\t\t\t IT is remarkable, in the fortune of this emperor, that he owed both his elevation\n\t\t\t\t\tand catastrophe to the inextricable embarrassments in which he was involved;\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst, in respect of pecuniary circumstances, and next, of political. He was\n\t\t\t\t\tnot, so far as we can learn, a follower of any of the sects of philosophers\n\t\t\t\t\twhich justified, and even recommended suicide, in particular cases: yet he\n\t\t\t\t\tperpetrated that act with extraordinary coolness and resolution; and, what is no\n\t\t\t\t\tless remarkable, from the motive, as he avowed, of public expediency only. It\n\t\t\t\t\twas observed of him, for many years after his death, that \"none ever died like\n\t\t\t\t\tOtho.\" \n\t\t\t"
