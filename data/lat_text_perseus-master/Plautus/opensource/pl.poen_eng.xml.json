The Procurer being at enmity with Agorastocles, the latter, with the assistance of his servant Milphio, devises a plan for outwitting him. Collybiscus, the bailiff of Agorastocles, is dressed up as a foreigner, and, a sum of money being given him for the purpose, pretends to take up his abode in the house of Lycus. On this being effected, by previous arrangement Agorastocles comes with witnesses, and accuses the Procurer of harbouring his slave, and encouraging him to rob his master. At this conjuncture, Hanno arrives at Calydon in search of his daughters. He discovers them, and finds that Agorastocles is the son of his deceased cousin.

You who have eaten, by far the most wisely have you done: you who have not eaten, do you be filled with the Play. But he who has something ready for him to eat, 'tis  great folly in him, for our sakes, to come here to sit fasting. Rise up, cryer! bespeak attention among the people: I'm now waiting  if you know your duty. Exercise your voice, by means of which you subsist and find your clothes; for unless you do cry out, in your silence starvation will be creeping upon you. Well, now sit down again, that you may earn double wages. Heaven grant success! do you obey my commands. Let no worn-out debauchee be sitting in the front of the stage, nor let the lictor or his rods be noisy in the least; and let no seat-keeper be walking about before  faces, nor be showing any to their seats, while the actor is on the stage. Those who have been sleeping too long at home in idleness, it's right for them now to stand contentedly, or else let them master their drowsiness. Don't let slaves be occupying the seats, that there may be room for those who are free; or else let them pay down the money for their places; if that they cannot do, let them be off home,  escape a double evil, lest they be variegated both here with scourges, and with thongs at home, if they've not got things in due order when their masters come home. Let nurses keep children, baby-bantlings, at home, and let no one bring them to see the Play; lest both they themselves may be athirst, and the children may die with hunger; and that they mayn't be squealing about here, in their hungry fits, just like kids. Let the matrons see the piece in silence, in silence laugh,  let them refrain from screaming here with their shrill voices; their themes for gossip let them carry off home, so as not to be an annoyance to their husbands both here and at home. And, as regards the managers of the performance, let not the palm  be given to any player wrongfully, nor by reason of favour let any be driven out of doors, in order that the inferior may be preferred to the good ones. And this, too, besides, which I had almost forgotten: while the performance is going on, do you, lacqueys, make an onset on the cookshops; now, while there's an opportunity, now, while the tarts are smoking hot, hasten there. These injunctions, which have been given as the manager's command, Heaven prosper them! troth now, let every one remember for himself. Now, in its turn, I wish to go back to the plot, that you may be equally knowing with myself. Its site, its limits, its boundaries I'll now lay down; for that purpose have I been appointed surveyor. But, unless it's troublesome, I wish to give you the name of this Comedy: but if it is an annoyance, I'll tell you still, since I have leave from those who have the management. This Comedy is called the \"Carthaginian;\" in the Latin, Plautus has called it \"the Pulse-eating Kinsman.\" You have the name, then; now hear the rest of the story; for here will this plot be judged of  Its own stage is the  place for every plot; you are the critics; I pray you lend attention. There were two cousins-german, Carthaginians, of a very high and very wealthy family. One of them is  alive, the other's dead. The more confidently do I inform you  because the undertaker told me so, who anointed him  But the only son there was of that old man who died, being separated from his father, was stolen at Carthage when seven years old, six years, in fact, before his father died. When he saw that his only son was lost to him, he himself, from grief, fell sick; he made this cousin-german of his his heir; he himself departed for Acheron without taking leave. The person who stole the child, carried him off to Calydon,  sold him here to a certain rich old man for his master, one desirous of children,  a hater of women. This old man, without knowing it, bought the son of his host, that same child, and adopted him as his own son, and made him his heir when he himself departed this life. This young man is dwelling here in this house.  Once more do I return to Carthage. If you want to give any commission, or  to be managed--unless a person gives the money, he will be mistaken; but he who does give it will be very much more  But this father's cousin of his at Carthage, the old man who is still alive, had two daughters. The one when in her fifth year, the other in her fourth, were lost, together with their nurse, from the walks in the suburbs. The person who kidnapped them, carried them off to Anactorium, and sold them all, both nurse and girls, for ready money, to a man (if a Procurer is a man) the most accursed of men, as many as the earth contains; but do you yourselves now form a conjecture what sort of man it is whose name is Lycus. He removed, not long ago, from Anactorium, where he formerly lived, to Calydon here, for the sake of his business. Be dwells in that house.  This young man is dying distractedly in love with one of them, his kinswoman, not knowing that fact; neither is he aware who she is, nor has he ever touched her (so much does the Procurer hamper him); neither has he hitherto ever had any improper connexion with her, nor  taken her  nor has that  been willing to send her  Because he sees that he is in love, he wishes to touch  man for a  haul. A certain Captain, who is desperately in love with her, is desirous to buy this younger one to be his mistress. But their father, the Carthaginian, since he lost them, has been continually seeking them in every quarter, by sea and land. When he has entered any city, at once he seeks out all the courtesans, wherever each of them is living; he gives  gold,  prolongs the night  after that he asks whence she comes, of what country, whether she was made captive or kidnapped, born of what family, who her parents were. So diligently and so skilfully does he seek for his daughters. He knows all languages, too; but, though he knows them, he pretends not to know them: what need is there of talking? He is a Carthaginian all over. He, in the evening of yesterday, came into harbour here on board ship. The father of these girls, the same is the father's cousin of this young man. Now d'ye take this? If you do take it, draw it out: take care not to break it asunder; pray, let it proceed.  Dear me! I had almost forgotten to say the rest. He who adopted this  as his own son, the same was the guest of that Carthaginian, this  father. He will come here to-day, and discover his daughters here, and this person, his cousin's son, as indeed I've learnt. He,  who'll come to-day, will find his daughters and this his cousin's son. But after this, farewell!--attend; I'm off; I now intend to become another man. As to what remains, some others remain who'll explain  I'll go  dress. With kindly feelings do you  recognize me. Farewell!  give me your aid, that Salvation may prove propitious to you."}}}}, {"@type": "act", "@n": "1", "div2": [{"@type": "scene", "@n": "1", "milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "line"}, {"@n": "129", "@unit": "TLN line"}], "stage": "Enter, from his house, AGORASTOCLES, followed by MILPHIO.", "sp": [{"speaker": "AGORASTOCLES", "p": {"hi": [{"@rend": "ital", "#text": "matters"}, {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "and"}, {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "and"}, {"@rend": "ital", "#text": "both"}], "#text": "Full oft have I entrusted many matters to you, Milphio,  of doubt  necessity,  standing in need of good counsel, which you wisely, discreetly, cleverly, and skilfully have by your aid brought to completion for me.

But here lived formerly my guest Antidamas. They say that he has done that which he was doomed to do. They say that his son Agorastocles lives here. To him am I carrying with me this token of hospitality. He has been pointed as living in this neighbourhood. I'll make enquiry of these who are coming hither out of doors.\" The learned Bochart, in his Phaleg, considers that the first ten lines are Punic, and that the other eight are, possibly, Lybic, of which the sense had been previously given in Punic; and, in fact, he quite despaired of translating them His translation of the first ten very nearly agrees with that given by Plautus himself. Samuel Petit, in his Miscellanea, considers the whole to be Hebrew, and translates his version (which consists of sixteen lines) as follows: 1. Give ear and attend, O Gods and Goddesses, under whose protection are the men of this city. 2. Receive as acceptable my prayers and my integrity. TwO daughters did I beget, my strength. 3. Urged on by fate, I caused them on each feast-day of the Gods to go to the gardens. 4. With much rejoicing, and on the day of song, there was a void. 5. The girls, being stolen, forsook me. Whither shall I go, pacing all chambers? 6. Where is he who bore them away? that I may remove the helplessness of my sorrow which he produces for me like fruit, in being the father of, and rearing, children. 7. They have said that here, assuredly, Agorastocles lives. 8. I have a token of hospitality, the likeness of Saturn (I'm carrying it), 9. Between us. May there be some end for my journey, that rest at last may be afforded to my integrity. 10. So that alone and wretched and afflicted I may not wander to and fro but rather that I may meet with my children, and pay my vows and oblations 11. To the Gods and Goddesses whom I've invoked as my advisers and assistants, 12. To purify my house from the griefs with which I was affected when I praised them. But they heard not my words, and I am most afflicted and am despondent in mind. 13. O my hope, come hither, and whatever troubles await me, cause me to endure them. Take courage from the truth of oracles, and of the responses of the God  from divinations, and forewarnings, and prodigies. 14. Be thou speedily fulfilled; arouse thyself and pray. Would that they could hear: grief would depart from a devout parent, and I should recognize Aristocles, my brother's son. 15. Attentively hear this lamentation, O God, my power, make haste to the truth of thy promise of my exaltation, O God, and my evil odours shall cease. 16. Lo!  from henceforth will I to the best of my means show honor, sacrificing spelt to all the Gods, and singing praises!!!"}, "#text": ".
