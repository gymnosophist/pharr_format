The Second Macedonian War, with which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis volume is mainly concerned, was fought in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcouncil-chamber quite as effectively as on the battlefield. Yet Rome's policy was by no means obvious\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto her, and her motives for engaging in the war were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuncertain even to the Romans who made the decision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey were just beginning to feel the charm of classical\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGreek culture, but their traditional policy of isolation\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdrew them away. Their generals and statesmen were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinexperienced in the diplomatic subtleties of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tolder world. The Greeks welcomed their military\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance, yet resented their presence in Greece as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan independent power.", "It may seem clear to us that Rome had only two\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourses of action open to her: to allow the eastern\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstates to destroy one another without interference,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor to assume complete control of the eastern Mediterranean.

What a difference that makes, if you never knew before, you found out at least in the recent Punic war. For who doubts that if, when the Saguntines were besieged and were invoking our protection, we had promptly sent aid to them, as our fathers did to the Mamertines, we should have diverted the whole war to Spain, whereas by our delay we admitted it to Italy, with infinite losses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t to ourselves? Nor is there any doubt in the case of this same Philip, when he had already bargained with Hannibal, through ambassadors and by means of letters, to invade Italy, that when we sent Laevinus with a fleet to begin an offensive campaign against him, we kept him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t in Macedonia. And that which we did then, when we had Hannibal fighting in Italy, do we hesitate to do now, when Hannibal has been driven out and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Carthaginians conquered? Let us permit the king by the capture of Athens, as we permitted Hannibal by the capture of Saguntum, to see how slow we are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t to act: not in five months, as when Hannibal came from Saguntum, but in five days after he sets sail from Corinth, Philip will arrive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t in Italy! You need not compare Philip with Hannibal nor the Macedonians with the Carthaginians; you will compare him at least with Pyrrhus. Compare, did I say? How great is the superiority, man to man or nation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t to nation! Epirus has always been and is to-day a mere appendage to the Macedonian empire. Philip has under his control the whole of the Peloponnesus and Argos itself, famed not so much in ancient story as for the death\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of Pyrrhus. Now compare our situation: How much more prosperous was Italy, how much greater her resources; her leaders alive, so many armies intact, which the Punic war later destroyed. Yet when Pyrrhus attacked he shattered her at a blow and came a conqueror almost to the gates\n\t\t\t\t\t\t of Rome! Not only the Tarentines and that part of the Italian coast which men call' Greater Greece,' so that one would expect them to have followed the Greek language and name, but the Lucanian, the Bruttian, the Samnite revolted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t from us. Do you think that these peoples will remain quiet and steadfast if Philip invades Italy? 'Yes,' you say, ' for they did in the later Punic war.' Never will these peoples fail to revolt unless there is no enemy at hand for them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t to join. If you had been reluctant to invade Africa, you would have Hannibal and the Carthaginians fighting in Italy to-day. Let Macedonia, not Italy, have war; let it be the enemy's farms and cities that are laid waste with fire and sword.

Then the dispute with the king's envoys about the land began.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Carthaginians maintained their case by their boundary-rights, because the\n\t\t\t\t\t district was within the limits which Publius Scipio, when he conquered them, had set for the land which should be under\n\t\t\t\t\t Carthaginian jurisdiction, and by the king's own admission, who, when he was pursuing Aphthir, a fugitive from his country, who was wandering around Cyrene with a party of Numidians, had requested, as a favour from them, a right of way through this very country as if it had without question belonged to the Carthaginians.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Numidians charged that they were not telling the truth about the limits fixed by Scipio, and asked, if one wanted to determine the real origin of a property-right, what land in Africa was really Carthaginian. Coming there as strangers, they had been granted as a gift, for the purpose of building a city, as much land as they could encompass with the cut-up hide of a bull;\n\t\t\t\t\t to whatever extent they had expanded beyond the limits of the Bursa, their seat, they had land gained by violence and without right.\n\t\t\t\t\t As to the particular tract of land in question, they could not even prove that they had held it for any considerable time, and much less that they had held it continuously from the time they had begun to claim it. As occasion offered, now they and now the Numidian kings had claimed the right to it, and possession had always remained with the party that was stronger in arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t They asked that the land should remain in the condition in which it was before the Carthaginians became enemies to the Romans and the king of the Numidians their ally and friend and not to interfere to prevent that person from holding the land who was able to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t It was decided that the envoys of both states should receive the reply that they would send ambassadors to Africa to judge, on the actual ground, between the Carthaginian people and the king.\n\t\t\t\t\t The ambassadors who were sent were Publius Scipio Africanus, Gaius Cornelius Cethegus, and Marcus Minucius Rufus, and after hearing the testimony and inspecting the place they left the matter undecided, without expressing an opinion in favour of either side.\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether they did this of their own accord or because they had been so instructed is not so certain as that this seemed expedient under the circumstances, that the case be left entirely undecided;\n\t\t\t\t\t if this were not the case, Scipio alone, either from his knowledge of the affair or through his personal influence, since he deserved so well of both sides, could have settled the dispute by a nod."}], "milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.441"}, {"@id": "p.461"}, {"@id": "p.477"}, {"@id": "p.509"}, {"@id": "p.529"}, {"@id": "p.555"}, {"@id": "p.565"}]}, {"@type": "book", "@n": "34s", "head": "Summary of Book XXXIV", "p": "The Oppian law, which Gaius Oppius, tribune of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople, had proposed during the Punic war to limit the\n\t\t\t\t\texpenditures of the women, was repealed after great\n\t\t\t\t\targument, though the principal speech against the\n\t\t\t\t\tabrogation of the law was made by Porcius Cato.
