From the other side a great body of cavalry was sent in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t against them.

Flying to arms they made an incursion into that very district, and spread such terror and confusion that not only the rural population, but the Roman commissioners themselves, who had come for the purpose of assigning lands, not trusting to the walls of Placentia, fled to Mutina.

This, too, is uncertain, whether envoys sent to expostulate with the Boi were maltreated, or an attack was made upon the three commissioners as they were measuring off the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t land.) Whilst they lay shut up in Mutina, the Gauls who know nothing of the art of assaulting cities, and, besides, are very indolent in regard to siege-works, and were now sitting idly down before the walls without attempting them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t feigned a readiness to treat for peace; and their leaders having invited the Romans to send out spokesmen to confer with them, they seized these envoys, in violation not only of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t law of nations, but also of a pledge which they had given for this time, and declared that they would not let them go unless their own hostages were restored to them. When word arrived of this affair of the envoys, and Mutina and its garrison were in danger, Lucius Manlius, the praetor, blazing with resentment, set out for Mutina with his army in loose marching\n\t\t\t\t\t\t order.

The alarming onsets of the Gauls and the panic of the Romans ended when they got clear of the trackless\n\t\t\t\t\t\t woods and thickets. Thereafter, marching across open ground, the Romans had no difficulty in protecting their column, and hastened to Tannetum, a village lying near the Po, where by means of temporary fortifications and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t supplies got in by the river, and with the help also of the Brixian Gauls, they defended themselves against the enemy, whose numbers were increasing daily."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "26"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}], "note": "P.

He had formerly been made consul without the confirmation of the auspices, and, though both gods and men had sought to recall him from the very battle-line, he had not obeyed; now, conscious of having spurned them, he had fled the Capitol and the vows that were regularly undertaken, that he might not, on the day of entering upon his office, approach the temple of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Jupiter Optimus Maximus; that he might not see and consult the senate, which hated him and which he alone of all men hated; that he might not proclaim the Latin Festival and offer the accustomed sacrifice to Jupiter Latiaris on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t the Alban Mount; that he might not, after receiving auspices, go up to the Capitol to make his vows, and thence proceed, in the general's cloak and accompanied by lictors, to his province; like some camp-follower, without insignia and without lictors, he had set out in secret and by stealth, precisely as though\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t going into exile; he thought, forsooth, that it was more in keeping with the dignity of his high command to begin his magistracy in Ariminum than in Rome to assume the purple-bordered toga in an inn than in the presence of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t his household gods! With one accord they voted to recall him and drag him back and compel him to discharge in person all his obligations to gods and men, before he went to his army\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t and his province. On this commission for commissioners they resolved to dispatch Quintus Terentius and Marcus Antistius set forth, but moved Flaminius no more than the letter sent him by the senate had moved him in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t his former consulship.

If you could behold the fetters, the squalor, the degradation of your fellow-citizens, assuredly the sight would move you no less profoundly than if, on the other hand, you saw your legions lying slaughtered on the fields of Cannae. One thing you can see the distress and tears of our kinsmen who are standing at the entrance of the Curia awaiting your\n\t\t\t\t\t\t decision. When these people are in such suspense and agony for us and for those who are absent, what think you the men themselves must feel whose life and liberty are hanging in the balance? If Hannibal Heaven help\n\t\t\t\t\t\t me!  should himself be pleased, against his nature, to show us mercy, we should nevertheless deem life a worthless boon, if we had seemed to you unworthy of being ransomed. There once came back to Rome some prisoners whom Pyrrhus had allowed to go scot-free; but they came back in company with envoys, the first men of the state, whom you had sent to ransom\n\t\t\t\t\t\t them. Am I to come back to my country as a citizen not reckoned to be worth three hundred pieces? Every man, Conscript Fathers, has his own way of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t thinking. I know that my life and person are in jeopardy; but I am troubled more by the danger to my honour lest we depart under your condemnation and rebuff; for the world will never believe that you were niggardly about the cost."}, "#text": "As for the envoys of the prisoners, the dictator admitted them into the senate, where their leader spoke as follows:"}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "60"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4??"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}], "note": {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "patres."}, "#text": "The Comitium was an open area next to the Curia.

Before daylight, he declared, they could reach a place of safety among the towns of the allies.\n\t\t\t\t If he had said what, within the recollection of our grandsires, Publius Decius, tribune of the soldiers, said in Samnium; or what Marcus Calpurnius Flamma said, when we ourselves were young men, in the former Punic war, to three hundred volunteers whom he was leading to take a hill that rose in the very midst of the enemy: 'Soldiers, let us die, and by our death set free the beleaguered legions' if\n\t\t\t\t Publius Sempronius had said  I should have deemed you no true men, to say nothing of Romans, if none had come forward to share so brave an exploit.\n\t\t\t\t But instead he points out to you a road that leads to safety as surely as to fame.

If so many brave examples could not move you, nothing ever will. If that dreadful carnage has not made life cheap, none ever will. Long for your country, whilst you are free and unattainted. Nay, rather, long for it whilst it  your country, whilst you are reckoned with its citizens.\n\t\t\t\t Too late now is your longing; you have forfeited your status, lost your civic rights, been made slaves of the Carthaginians. Do you think to return, for ransom, to that condition which you forfeited by cowardice and turpitude?\n\t\t\t\t You would not listen to Publius Sempronius, your fellow citizen, when he bade you arm and follow him; but you listened to Hannibal a little later, when he bade you betray the camp and surrender your arms. But why do I charge these men with cowardice when I could bring against them a charge of crime?\n\t\t\t\t For not only did they refuse to follow a man who gave them good advice, but they tried to thwart and hinder him; and those heroic men were forced to draw their swords and thrust the cowards from their path.

Out of seven thousand soldiers, six hundred were sufficiently courageous to force their way through and return to their country, free and armed.\n\t\t\t\t Nor did these six hundred encounter any opposition from the enemy; how safe then, think you, would have been their march, if they had amounted almost to two legions?\n\t\t\t\t You would have to-day under arms at Canusium, Conscript Fathers, twenty thousand brave and loyal men. But how can these men now be good and loyal citizens for they themselves would hardly claim to be brave?\n\t\t\t\t Unless we are to believe that they helped their comrades to sally out, when in fact they tried to prevent the sally; or that they grudge not those men both the safety and the renown their courage has earned them, knowing, as they do, that fear and cowardice are the cause of their own disgraceful servitude. They had a good chance of escaping in the silence of the night, but preferred to hide in their tents and await both the day and the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t But perhaps, though they lacked the courage to sally forth, they had courage enough for a valiant defence of the camp? Perhaps they were besieged for several days and nights, and protected the rampart with their swords, and themselves with the rampart?\n\t\t\t\t and finally, after suffering the last extremities, when every support of life gave out and their strength was so impaired with hunger that they could now no longer hold up their shields, they were overcome by the necessities of human nature and not by arms?\n\t\t\t\t Nay, the sun was up when the enemy approached the rampart, and the day was not two hours old when, without once putting their fortune to the test of battle, they surrendered both their arms and their persons. Such, mark you, were the exploits these men performed during two days.\n\t\t\t\t When they ought to have stood fast in the line and fought, they fled to their tents; when they ought to have fought for their stockade, they surrendered the camp, worthless alike in the field and behind entrenchments.\n\t\t\t\t And you would have us ransom you? When it is time to sally from your camp, you hesitate and stop there; when it is needful that you stop and defend it with your swords, you hand over camp and swords and your own bodies to the enemy!\n\t\t\t\t No, Conscript Fathers, I would no more vote for ransoming these men than I would for giving those others up to Hannibal, who forced their way from the camp through the midst of enemies, and, by exerting the utmost valour, gave themselves back to their country."}}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "61"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2??"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}], "note": [{"date": {"@value": "-194", "#text": "194 B.C."}, "#text": "But the senate could not keep Hannibal from making money out of his prisoners.
