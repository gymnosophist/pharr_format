The cause of his banishment is not precisely known, and various conjectures have been started on the subject. By some it has been asserted, that he was banished for the too great freedom of his Elegies and his Art of Love; but this seems an improbable conjecture for neither the age in which he lived, nor the court which he adorned, were very remarkable for severity of manners or correctness of morals. Another conjecture is, that he was banished for some favors which he received from Julia, the daughter of Augustus, whom he is supposed to have celebrated under the name of  in his Elegies. But that this conjecture is unfounded, is proved (as Aldus Manutius has shown) by Ovid's saying, that his exile was owing to two causes, his writing amorous verses, and to his having been an undesigned spectator of the guilt of others.

If the imitation of nature be the business of a poet,  is unrivalled, especially in the descriptions of the passions. His thoughts, which are the pictures of those passions, are such as naturally arise from those disorderly emotions of our spirits. It is not speaking of his wit too partially, to observe, that such was the copiousness of it, and such its exuberance, that he often writes too pointedly for his subject, that he often makes his personages speak more eloquently than propriety of character will admit of. Yet this is only the fault of a great and polished genius, and he seems to have discovered this imperfection in his riper years, for his later productions are free from it  But this alloy in 's writing is sufficiently recompensed by his other excellencies; and, indeed, the fault itself is not without its beauties, for the most severe critic can scarcely but be pleased with the prodigality of his wit, though, at the same time, he could have wished that the master of it had been a better manager. \"Every thing he does,\" to quote the language of a great poet of our own country, Dryden, who studied and translated  with equal care and elegance, \"becomes him; and if sometimes he appears too gay, yet there is a secret gracefulness of youth which accompanies his writings, though the staidness and sobriety of age be wanting. In the most material part, which is the conduct, it is certain that he seldom has miscarried.\""}, "The Art of Love has been generally admitted to be one of the most perfect pieces of Ovid. Indeed it was a subject to which the whole business of his life was devoted, and therefore it was scarcely possible he could fail of treating it in a masterly manner.", "So gentle was our poet's Muse, that he was never known to write but one severe poem, and that was against Cornificus, (under the feigned name of Ibis,) who solicited his wife in his absence, and laboured against the repeal of his banishment.", "The works of Ovid are well known, and his poetical talents have justly ranked him among the first of Roman poets. But it is not necessary here to speak at length of any except such as compose the present volume. With regard to the \"Art of Love,\" it may justly be styled a correct and finished poem, abounding in graceful thoughts and happy allusions, and the whole exquisitely polished. It is recorded of the Emperor Aelius Verus, that he was so delighted with this work that he often read it in bed, and laid it under his pillow when he went to sleep. Latter critics are equally profuse in their praises of the same work; and Ciofanus says, that Ovid was so excellently skilled in the Latin tongue, that if the Roman language was utterly lost, and nothing left but his works, they alone would be sufficient to retrieve it. Some over-scrupulous persons have affected to perceive danger in some of the maxims inculcated in the Art of Love, but their greatest offence seems to have been in the title of that work; and they have overlooked the circumstance, that our author has prescribed a Remedy for Love, which may serve to correct any of the mischiefs that are likely to spring from the first named treatise. Indeed, some ingenious commentators have supposed, that Ovid designed, under the allegory of physical and sensual love, to recommend to his disciples excellent rules to acquire the virtues and science represented under the name of the Muses, or ladies of various beauty, who were to be met with everywhere, especially in great academies, in the schools, in courts, in walks, and in holy places, figured by the theatres, galleries, porticos, and temples of the Roman deities, where great assemblies were held.

The best are those which have a pathetic character, for as they were composed, for the most, to alleviate the melancholy hours of our poet's banishment, it was natural to suppose that his Muse would find more relief in tender and soothing strains than when employed on gayer subjects, which would only serve to remind him of his former condition, and aggravate his unhappiness, by fruitless comparisons of his present with his past situation. The style of them varies according to the rank of the person to whom they are addressed, or the subjects on which they are composed. The style of those addressed to his mistress is tenderly passionate and courtly; that of the Elegies to Nape and , his mistress's waiting-women, is in a lower style, and more suitable to the conditions of the persons to whom they are addressed. When Ovid treats of the immortality of the Muses, as he does in the last elegy of the first book, or pours out a mournful strain to the memory of Tibullus, we are equally delighted with the grandeur of his ideas, and melted with the tenderness of his sentiments. In a word, Ovid is, throughout, a perfect poet, and, as such, will always give delight to readers of sensibility and taste.  His views of nature are so clear, his delineations of the passions are so just, and his reflections upon them so correct, that he must be a reader frigid, even to indifference, whose fancy is not delighted, whose heart is not warmed, or whose judgment is not improved, by his writings."}, {"quote": {"@lang": "en", "lg": {"@type": "heroic", "l": ["Here Ovid lies, who sung of tender love,", "Yet liv'd the danger of his wit to prove;", "To you, true lovers, he makes one request,", "As you pass by, to say, - May Ovid rest."]}}, "#text": "We shall conclude this brief sketch of a man whose name will endure as long as poetry exists, with the following epitaph, which he composed for himself, and which is exquisitely beautiful for its simplicity:"}]}, {"@type": "section", "@n": "2", "head": "A Note on the Translations", "p": [{"title": ["Art of Love", "Remedy of Love", "Court of Love", "History of Love", "Amores", "Miscellany Poems", "Dryden's Miscellany"], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,2298785", "#text": "Dryden"}, {"@key": "tgn,7002445", "#text": "England"}, {"@key": "tgn,7011781", "#text": "London"}, {"@key": "tgn,7002445", "#text": "England"}], "dateRange": [{"@from": "1631", "@to": "1700", "#text": "1631-1700"}, {"@from": "1670", "@to": "1729", "#text": "1670-1729"}, {"@from": "1652", "@to": "1715", "#text": "1652-1715"}, {"@from": "1709", "@to": "1900", "#text": "18th and 19th c."}], "date": [{"@value": "1692", "#text": "1692"}, {"@value": "1709", "#text": "1709"}, {"@value": "1684", "#text": "1684"}], "#text": "The first book of the  was translated by John  ().

It was done in honour of  Caprotina according to Macrobius, in his Saturnalia, book i. chap. 2. The free maidens and servants, says the same author, sacrificed on that day to Juno, under a wild fig-tree, called in Latin Caprilicus, in memory of that complaisant virtue which inspired the servant maids to expose themselves to the lust and revenge of the enemy for the preservation of the public honour. For after the Gauls had taken the city, and were driven out again, when things were restored to their former order, the neighbouring nations believing the Romans were very much weakened by the late invasion, siege, and sack, took hold of that opportunity to invade them, choosing Posthumius Livius of Fidenes for their chief, and demanded of the senate, that if they would preserve their city and authority, they should send them their wives and daughters. The senators taking the matter into consideration, could not tell what answer to return. They knew their own weakness and the strength of their enemies; and in this uncertainty a servant-maid called Tutelar, or Philotis. offered to go with some other maids of the same condition to the enemy.  This proposal was generally liked, and accordingly the maids were dressed like the wives of the senators, and the daughters of free citizens, and went weeping to put themselves into the hands of the invaders. Livius ordered them  to be dispersed into several quarters; and, as they had agreed among themselves, they tempted their new husbands to drink, pretending that day ought to be celebrated as a festival; and when they were almost dead drunk they gave the Romans a signal from the top of a fig-tree to fall on. The latter were encamped not far off; and at this signal they assautled and easily mastered the enemy's camp. putting most of them to the sword.
