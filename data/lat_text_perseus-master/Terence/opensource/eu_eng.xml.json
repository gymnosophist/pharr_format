Her mother dying,\n                        her property is put up for sale, and Pamphila is purchased as a slave by\n                        Thraso, an officer and an admirer of Thais, who happens just then to be\n                        visiting . During the absence\n                        of Thraso, Thais becomes acquainted with Phasdria, an Athenian youth, the\n                        son of Laches; she also discovers from Chremes, who lives near , that Pamphila, her former\n                        companion, is his sister.

Donatus thinks that this is the\n                                meaning of the passage, and that, content with this slight reference\n                                to a well-known fact, the author passes it by in contemptuous\n                                silence."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "lemma": {"@targOrder": "U", "#text": "And in the Thesaurus has\n                                    described"}, "quote": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "'Athenienses, bellum cum\n                                    Rhodiensibus, Quod fuerit, quid ego praedicem?'"}, "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "'de Thesauro,'"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "'atque in\n                                    Thesauro scripsit'"}], "#text": "Cook has the following appropriate remark upon\n                                this passage: \"In the 'Thesaurus,' or 'Treasure' of Luscus Lavinius,\n                                a young fellow, having wasted his estate by his extravagance, sends\n                                a servant to search his father's monument: but he had before sold\n                                the ground on which the monument was, to a covetous old man; to whom\n                                the servant applies to help him open the monument; in which they\n                                discover a hoard and a letter. The old fellow sees the treasure and\n                                keeps it; the young one goes to law with him, and the old man is\n                                represented as opening his cause first before the judge, which he\n                                begins with these words:-- \n                                'Athenians, why should I relate the war with the Rhodians?'

Thus far Bentley, from the same Scholiast [as referred to in\n                                the last Note]. This Note is a clear explanation of the four verses\n                                to which it belongs. Hare concurs with Madame Dacier in her opinion\n                                     that it is only a\n                                part of the Phasma of Menander, and not a distinct Play; but were I\n                                not determined by the more learned Bentley, the text itself would not permit me to be\n                                of their opinion; for the words  seem plainly to me to be a\n                                transition to another Play. The subject of the Thesaurus is related\n                                by Eugraphius, though not with all the circumstances mentioned in my\n                                Note from Bentlev.\" Colman also remarks here: \"Menander and his\n                                contemporary Philemon, each of them wrote a Comedy under this title.\n                                We have in the above Note the story of Menander's; and we know that\n                                of Philemon's from the 'Trinummus' of Plautus, which was a\n                                Translation of it.\""}, {"@anchored": "yes", "lemma": {"@targOrder": "U", "#text": "Opportunity of viewing it"}, "#text": "Colman thinks\n                                that this means something \"stronger than merely being present at the\n                                representation,\" and he takes the meaning to be, that having\n                                obtained leave to peruse the MS., he furnished himself with\n                                objections against the piece, which he threw out when it came to be\n                                represented before the magistrates.

Cooke says: \"If Plautus had wrote a Play\n                                under the title of 'Colax,' I should think it very unlikely that it\n                                should have escaped Terence's eye, considering how soon he\n                                flourished after Plautus, his being engaged in the same studies, and\n                                his having such opportunities to consult the libraries of the great;\n                                for though all learning was then confined to Manuscripts, Terence\n                                could have no difficulty in coming at the best copies. The character\n                                of the 'Miles Gloriosus' [Braggart Captain] here mentioned, I am\n                                inclined to think the same with that which is the hero of Plautus's\n                                Comedy, now extant, and called 'Miles Gloriosus,' from which Terence\n                                could not take his Thraso. Pyrgopolinices and Thraso are both full\n                                of themselves, both boast of their valor and their intimacy with\n                                princes, and both fancy themselves beloved by all the women who see\n                                them; and they are both played off by their Parasites, but they\n                                differ in their manner and their speech: Plautus's Pyrgopolinices is\n                                always in the clouds, and talking big, and of blood and\n                                wounds--Terence's Thraso never says too little nor much, but is an\n                                easy ridiculous character, continually supplying the Audience with\n                                mirth without the wild extravagant bluster of Pyrgopolinices;\n                                Plautus and Terence both took their soldiers and Parasites from\n                                Menander, but gave them different dresses.\" Upon this Note Colman\n                                remarks: \"Though there is much good criticism in the above Note, it\n                                is certain that Plautus did not take his 'Miles Gloriosus' from the\n                                Colax of Menander, as he himself informs us it was translated from a\n                                Greek play called  'the\n                                Boaster,' and the Parasite is but a trifling character in that play,\n                                never appearing after the first Scene.\""}, {"@anchored": "yes", "lemma": {"@targOrder": "U", "#text": "Hurrying servants"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "currentes servi"}, "bibl": [{"@n": "Ter.

Just as of late he has\n                            published the Phasma [the Apparition] of Menander; and in the Thesaurus\n                            [the Treasure] has described him from whom the gold is demanded, as\n                            pleading his cause why it should be deemed his own, before the person\n                            who demands it has stated how this treasure belongs to him, or how it\n                            came into the tomb of his father. Henceforward, let him not deceive\n                            himself, or fancy thus, \"I have now done with it; there's nothing that\n                            he can say to me.\" I recommend him not to be mistaken, and to refrain\n                            from provoking me.

After\n                            the Aediles had purchased the Eunuch of Menander, the Play which we are\n                            about to perform, he managed to get an opportunity of viewing\n                                it.\n                            When the magistrates were present it began to be performed. He exclaimed\n                            that a thief, no Poet, had produced the piece, but still had not\n                                deceived him;\n                            that, in fact, it was the Colax, an old Play of Plautus; and that from it were\n                            taken the characters of the Parasite and the Captain. If this is a\n                            fault, the fault is the ignorance of the Poet; not that he intended to\n                            be guilty of theft. That so it is, you will now be enabled to judge. The\n                            Colax is a Play of Meander's; in it there is Colax, a Parasite, and a\n                            braggart Captain: he does not deny that he has transferred these\n                            characters into his Eunuch from the Greek; but assuredly he does deny\n                            this, that he was aware that those pieces had been already translated\n                            into Latin. But if it is not permitted us to use the same characters as\n                            others, how can it any more be allowed to represent hurrying\n                                servants, to\n                            describe virtuous matrons, artful courtesans, the gluttonous parasite,\n                            the braggart captain, the infant palmed off, the old man cajoled by the\n                            servant, about love, hatred, suspicion? In fine, nothing is said now\n                            that has not been said before. Wherefore it is but just that you should\n                            know this, and make allowance, if the moderns do what the ancients used\n                            to do.
