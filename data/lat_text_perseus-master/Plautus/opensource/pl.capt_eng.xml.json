However, it seems much more probable, that the notion was that epilepsy was cured by the patient himself spitting out the noxious saliva; and that the word \"sputatur\" means, \"is spit out,\" i. e. \"is cured by spitting.\" Celsus thus describes the \"comitialis morbus,\" \"epilepsy,\" or \"falling sickness:\" \"The person seized, suddenly falls down; foam drops from the mouth; then, after a little time, he comes to himself, and gets up again without any assistance.\" Pliny, in his Natural History, B. 38, c. 4, says: \"Despuimus comitiales morbos, hoc est, contagia regerimus,\" \"We spit out the epilepsy, that is, we avert the contagion.\" This is said, probably, in reference to a belief, that on seeing an epileptic person, if we spit, we shall avoid the contagion; but it by no means follows that the person so doing must spit upon the epileptic person. We read in the first Book of Samuel, ch. xxi., ver. 12: \"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish, the King of Gath. And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.\" He probably pretended to be attacked with epileptic fits.

One malady, called \"herpes,\" or \"spreading ulcer,\" was said to be highly contagious, but capable of being cured by applications of saliva. Some Commentators here quote the method which our Saviour adopted in curing the blind man at Bethsaida: \"And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town: and when he had spat on his eyes and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught.\" St. Mark, ch. viii., ver. 23. And again, the account given in the ninth chapter of St. John, ver. 6: \"When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.\" It may be possible that our Saviour thought fit to adopt these forms, in imitation of some of the methods of treating diseases in those times; though, of course, his transcendant power did not require their agency Rost, in his Commentaries on Plautus, has a very learned disquisition on the meaning of the present passage."}, "#text": "Do you say, you whipp'd knave, that I am mad, and do you declare that I have followed my own father with spears?
