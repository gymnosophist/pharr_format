        "0":"\n\t\t\t\t JULIUS CAESAR, the divine, lost his\n\t\t\t\t\tfather when he was in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsixteenth year of his age; and the year following, being nominated to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe office of high-priest of Jupiter ,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t he repudiated Cossutia, who was very\n\t\t\t\t\twealthy, although her family belonged only to the equestrian order, and to whom\n\t\t\t\t\the had been contracted when he was a mere boy. He then married Cornelia, the\n\t\t\t\t\tdaughter of Cinna, who was four times consul; and had by her, shortly\n\t\t\t\t\tafterwards, a daughter named Julia. Resisting all the efforts of the dictator\n\t\t\t\t\tSylla to induce him to divorce Cornelia, he suffered the penalty of being\n\t\t\t\t\tstripped of his sacerdotal office, his wife's dowry, and his own patrimonial\n\t\t\t\t\testates; and, being identified with the adverse faction, was compelled to withdraw from Rome . After changing his place of concealment\n\t\t\t\t\tnearly every night, \n\t\t\t\t\talthough he was suffering from a quartan ague, and having effected his release\n\t\t\t\t\tby bribing the officers who had tracked his footsteps, he at length obtained a\n\t\t\t\t\tpardon through the intercession of the vestal virgins, and of Mamercus AEmilius\n\t\t\t\t\tand Aurelius Cotta, his near relatives. We are assured that when Sylla, having\n\t\t\t\t\twithstood for a while the entreaties of his own best friends, persons of\n\t\t\t\t\tdistinguished rank, at last yielded to their importunity, he exclaimed-either by\n\t\t\t\t\ta divine impulse, or from a shrewd conjecture: \"Your suit is granted, and you\n\t\t\t\t\tmay take him among you; but know,\" he added, \" that this man, for whose safety\n\t\t\t\t\tyou are so extremely anxious, will, some day or other, be the ruin of the party\n\t\t\t\t\tof the nobles, in defence of which you are leagued with me; for in this one\n\t\t\t\t\tCaesar, you will find many a Marius.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "1":"\n\t\t\t\t His first campaign was served in Asia ,\n\t\t\t\t\ton the staff of the praetor, M. Thermus; and being dispatched into Bithynia , to bring thence a fleet, he loitered so\n\t\t\t\t\tlong at the court of Nicomedes, as to give occasion to reports of lewd\n\t\t\t\t\tproceedings between him and that prince; which received additional credit from\n\t\t\t\t\this hasty return to Bithynia , under the\n\t\t\t\t\tpretext of recovering a debt due to a freedman, his client. The rest of his\n\t\t\t\t\tservice was more favourable to his reputation; and when Mitylene \n\t\t\t\t\t was taken by storm, he was presented by Thermus with the civic crown.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t",
        "2":"\n\t\t\t\t He served also in Cilicia , under Servilius Isauricus, but only for a short time; as\n\t\t\t\t\tupon receiving intelligence of Sylla's death, he returned with all speed to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Rome , in expectation of what might\n\t\t\t\t\tfollow from a fresh agitation set on foot by Marcus Lepidus. Distrusting,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, the abilities of this leader, and finding the times less favourable for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe execution of this project than he had at first imagined, he abandoned all\n\t\t\t\t\tthoughts of joining Lepidus, although he received the most tempting offers. \n\t\t\t",
        "3":"\n\t\t\t\t Soon after this civil discord was composed, he preferred a charge of extortion\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst Cornelius Dolabella, a man of consular dignity, who had obtained the\n\t\t\t\t\thonour of a triumph. On the acquittal of the accused, he resolved to retire to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Rhodes , with the view not only of avoiding the public\n\t\t\t\t\todium which he had incurred, but of prosecuting his studies with leisure and\n\t\t\t\t\ttranquillity, under Apollonius, the son of Molon, at that time the most\n\t\t\t\t\tcelebrated master of rhetoric. While on his voyage thither, in the winter\n\t\t\t\t\tseason, he was taken by pirates near the island of Pharmacusa, and detained by them, burning with indignation, for nearly forty days;\n\t\t\t\t\this only attendants being a physician and two chamberlains. For he had instantly\n\t\t\t\t\tdispatched his other servants and the friends who accompanied him, to raise\n\t\t\t\t\tmoney for his ransom. Fifty talents having been paid down, he was landed on the coast, when,\n\t\t\t\t\thaving collected some ships, he lost no time in putting to sea in pursuit of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpirates, and having captured them, inflicted upon them the punishment with which\n\t\t\t\t\the had often threatened them in jest. At that time Mithridates was ravaging the\n\t\t\t\t\tneighbouring districts, and on Caesar's arrival at Rhodes , that he might not appear to lie idle while danger\n\t\t\t\t\tthreatened the allies of Rome , he\n\t\t\t\t\tpassed over into Asia , and having\n\t\t\t\t\tcollected some auxiliary forces, and driven the king's governor out of the\n\t\t\t\t\tprovince, retained in their allegiance the cities which were wavering and ready\n\t\t\t\t\tto revolt. \n\t\t\t",
        "4":"\n\t\t\t\t Having been elected military tribune, the first honour he received from the\n\t\t\t\t\tsuffrages of the people after his return to Rome , he zealously assisted those who took measures for\n\t\t\t\t\trestoring the tribunitian authority, which had been greatly diminished during\n\t\t\t\t\tthe usurpation of Sylla. He likewise, by an act, which Plotius at his suggestion\n\t\t\t\t\tpropounded to the people, obtained the recall of Lucius Cinna, his wife's\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother, and others with him, who having been the adherents of Lepidus in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcivil disturbances, had after that consul's death fled to Sertorius; which law he supported by a speech. \n\t\t\t",
        "5":"\n\t\t\t\t During his quaestorship he pronounced funeral orations from the rostra, according\n\t\t\t\t\tto custom, in praise of his aunt Julia, and his wife Cornelia. In the panegyric\n\t\t\t\t\ton his aunt, he gives the following account of her own and his father's\n\t\t\t\t\tgenealogy, on both sides: \"My aunt Julia derived her descent, by the mother,\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom a race of kings, and by her father, from the Immortal Gods. For the Marcii\n\t\t\t\t\tReges, her\n\t\t\t\t\tmother's family, deduce their pedigree from Ancus Marcius, and the Julii, her\n\t\t\t\t\tfather's, from Venus; of which stock we are a branch. We therefore unite in our\n\t\t\t\t\tdescent the sacred majesty of kings, the chiefest among men, and the divine\n\t\t\t\t\tmajesty of Gods, to whom kings themselves are subject.\" To supply the place of\n\t\t\t\t\tCornelia, he married Pompeia, the daughter of Quintus Pompeius, and\n\t\t\t\t\tgrand-daughter of Lucius Sylla; but he afterwards divorced her, upon suspicion\n\t\t\t\t\tof her having been debauched by Publius Clodius. For so current was the report,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Clodius had found access to her disguised as a woman, during the\n\t\t\t\t\tcelebration of a religious solemnity, that the senate instituted an inquiry respecting the\n\t\t\t\t\tprofanation of the sacred rites. \n\t\t\t",
        "6":"\n\t\t\t\t Farther-Spain fell to his lot as quaestor; when\n\t\t\t\t\tthere, as he was going the circuit of the province, by commission from the\n\t\t\t\t\tpraetor, for the administration of justice, and had reached Gades , seeing a statue of Alexander the Great\n\t\t\t\t\tin the temple of Hercules, he sighed deeply, as if weary of his sluggish life,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor having performed no memorable actions at an ages at which Alexander had\n\t\t\t\t\talready conquered the world. He, therefore,\n\t\t\t\t\timmediately sued for his discharge, with the view of embracing the first\n\t\t\t\t\topportunity, which might present itself in The City, of entering upon a more\n\t\t\t\t\texalted career. In the stillness of the night following, he dreamt that he lay\n\t\t\t\t\twith his own mother; but his confusion was relieved, and his hopes were raised\n\t\t\t\t\tto the highest pitch, by the interpreters of his dream, who expounded it as an\n\t\t\t\t\tomen that he should possess universal empire; for that the mother who in his\n\t\t\t\t\tsleep he had found submissive to his embraces, was no other than the earth, the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommon parent of all mankind. \n\t\t\t",
        "7":"\n\t\t\t\t Quitting therefore the province before the expiration of the usual term, he\n\t\t\t\t\tbetook himself to the Latin colonies, which were then eagerly agitating the\n\t\t\t\t\tdesign of obtaining the freedom of Rome ; and he would have stirred them up to some bold attempt,\n\t\t\t\t\thad not the consuls, to prevent any commotion, detained for some time the\n\t\t\t\t\tlegions which had been raised for service in Cilicia . But this did not deter him from making, soon\n\t\t\t\t\tafterwards, a still greater effort within the precincts of the city itself. \n\t\t\t",
        "8":"\n\t\t\t\t For, only a few days before he entered upon the edileship, he incurred a\n\t\t\t\t\tsuspicion of having engaged in a conspiracy with Marcus Crassus, a man of\n\t\t\t\t\tconsular rank; to whom were joined Publius Sylla and Lucius Autronius, who,\n\t\t\t\t\tafter they had been chosen consuls, were convicted of bribery. The plan of the\n\t\t\t\t\tconspirators was to fall upon the senate at the opening of the new year, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmurder as many of them as should be thought necessary; upon which, Crassus was\n\t\t\t\t\tto assume the office of dictator, and appoint Caesar his master of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\thorse. When the commonwealth had been thus ordered according to\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir pleasure, the consulship was to have been restored to Sylla and Autronius.\n\t\t\t\t\tMention is made of this plot by Tanusius Geminus in his history, by Marcus Bibulus in his edicts, and by Curio, the father, in his orations. Cicero likewise seems to hint at this in a letter to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Axius , where he says, that Caesar\n\t\t\t\t\thad in his consulship secured to himself that arbitrary power to which\n\t\t\t\t\the had aspired when he was edile. Tanusius adds, that Crassus, from remorse or\n\t\t\t\t\tfear, did not appear upon the day appointed for the massacre of the senate; for\n\t\t\t\t\twhich reason Caesar omitted to give the signal, which, according to the plan\n\t\t\t\t\tconcerted between them, he was to have made. The agreement, Curio says, was that\n\t\t\t\t\the should shake off the toga from his shoulder. We have the authority of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame Curio, and of M. Actorius Naso, for his having been likewise concerned in\n\t\t\t\t\tanother conspiracy with young Cneius Piso; to whom, upon a suspicion of some\n\t\t\t\t\tmischief being meditated in the city, the province of Spain was decreed out of the regular\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcourse. It is said to\n\t\t\t\t\thave been agreed between them, that Piso should head a revolt in the provinces,\n\t\t\t\t\twhilst the other should attempt to stir up an insurrection at Rome , using as their instruments the\n\t\t\t\t\tLambrani, and the tribes beyond the Po. But the execution of this design was\n\t\t\t\t\tfrustrated in both quarters by the death of Piso. \n\t\t\t",
        "9":"\n\t\t\t\t In his edileship, he not only embellished the Comitium, and the rest of the Forum, with the adjoining halls, but adorned the Capitol also, with\n\t\t\t\t\ttemporary piazzas, constructed for the purpose of displaying some part of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperabundant collections he had made for the amusement of the people. He entertained them with the hunting of wild beasts, and with games,\n\t\t\t\t\tboth alone and in conjunction with his colleague. On this account, he obtained\n\t\t\t\t\tthe whole credit of the expense to which they had jointly contributed; insomuch\n\t\t\t\t\tthat his colleague, Marcus Bibulus, could not forbear remarking, that he was\n\t\t\t\t\tserved in the manner of Pollux. For as the temple erected in the Forum to the two\n\t\t\t\t\tbrothers, went by the name of Castor alone, so his and Caesar's joint\n\t\t\t\t\tmunificence was imputed to the latter only. To the other public spectacles\n\t\t\t\t\texhibited to the people, Caesar added a fight of gladiators, but with fewer\n\t\t\t\t\tpairs of combatants than he had intended. For he had collected from all parts so\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat a company of them, that his enemies became alarmed; and a decree was made,\n\t\t\t\t\trestricting the number of gladiators which any one was allowed to retain at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Rome . \n\t\t\t",
        "10":"\n\t\t\t\t Having thus conciliated popular favour, he endeavoured, through his interest with\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of the tribunes, to get Egypt \n\t\t\t\t\tassigned to him as a province, by an act of the people. The pretext alleged for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe creation of this extraordinary government, was, that the Alexandrians had\n\t\t\t\t\tviolently expelled their king, whom the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenate had complimented with the title of an ally and friend of the Roman\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople. This was generally resented; but, notwithstanding, there was so much\n\t\t\t\t\topposition from the faction of the nobles, that he could not carry his point. In\n\t\t\t\t\torder, therefore, to diminish their influence by every means in his power, he\n\t\t\t\t\trestored the trophies erected in honor of Caius Marius, on account of his\n\t\t\t\t\tvictories over Jugurtha, the Cimbri, and the Teutoni, which had been demolished\n\t\t\t\t\tby Sylla; and when sitting in judgment upon murderers, he treated those as\n\t\t\t\t\tassassins, who, in the late proscription, had received money from the treasury,\n\t\t\t\t\tfor bringing in the heads of Roman citizens, although they were expressly\n\t\t\t\t\texcepted in the Cornelian laws. \n\t\t\t",
        "11":"\n\t\t\t\t He likewise suborned some one to prefer an impeachment for treason against Caius\n\t\t\t\t\tRabirius, by whose especial assistance the senate had, a few years before, put\n\t\t\t\t\tdown Lucius Saturninus, the seditious tribune; and being drawn by lot a judge on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe trial, he condemned him with so much animosity, that upon his appealing to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people, no circumstance availed him so much as the extraordinary bitterness\n\t\t\t\t\tof his judge. \n\t\t\t",
        "12":"\n\t\t\t\t Having renounced all hope of obtaining Egypt for his province, he stood candidate for the office of\n\t\t\t\t\tchief pontiff, to secure which, he had recourse to the most profuse bribery.\n\t\t\t\t\tCalculating, on this occasion, the enormous amount of the debts he had\n\t\t\t\t\tcontracted, he is reported to have said to his mother, when she kissed him at\n\t\t\t\t\this going out in the morning to the assembly of the people, \"I will never return\n\t\t\t\t\thome unless I am elected pontiff.\" In effect, he left so far behind him two most\n\t\t\t\t\tpowerful competitors, who were much his superiors both in age and rank, that he\n\t\t\t\t\thad more votes in their own tribes, than they both had in all the tribes\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether. \n\t\t\t",
        "13":"\n\t\t\t\t After he was chosen praetor, the conspiracy of Catiline was discovered; and while\n\t\t\t\t\tevery other member of the senate voted for inflicting capital punishment on the\n\t\t\t\t\taccomplices in that crime, he alone proposed that the delinquents should be distributed\n\t\t\t\t\tfor safe custody among the towns of Italy , their property being confiscated. He even struck such\n\t\t\t\t\tterror into those who were advocates of severity, by representing to them what\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal odium would be attached to their memories by the Roman people, that\n\t\t\t\t\tDecius Silanus, consul-elect, did not hesitate to qualify his proposal, it not\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing very honourable to change it, by a lenient interpretation: as if it had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen understood in a harsher sense than he intended, and Caesar would certainly\n\t\t\t\t\thave carried his point, having brought over to his side a great number of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenators, among whom was Cicero, the consul's brother, had not a speech by\n\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Cato infused new vigour into the resolutions of the senate. He persisted,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, in obstructing the measure, until a body of the Roman knights, who\n\t\t\t\t\tstood under arms as a guard, threatened him with instant death, if he continued\n\t\t\t\t\this determined opposition. They even thrust at him with their drawn swords, so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat those who sat next him moved away; and a few friends, with no small\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficulty, protected him, by throwing their arms round him, and covering him\n\t\t\t\t\twith their togas. At last, deterred by this violence, he not only gave way, but\n\t\t\t\t\tabsented himself from the senate-house during the remainder of that year. \n\t\t\t",
        "14":"\n\t\t\t\t Upon the first day of his praetorship, he summoned Quintus Catulus to render an\n\t\t\t\t\taccount to the people respecting the repairs to the Capitol; proposing a decree for transferring the office of curator to\n\t\t\t\t\tanother person. But being unable to withstand the strong\n\t\t\t\t\topposition made by the aristocratical party, whom he perceived quitting, in\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat numbers, their attendance upon the new consuls, and fully resolved to resist his proposal, he dropped the\n\t\t\t\t\tdesign. \n\t\t\t",
        "15":"\n\t\t\t\t He afterwards approved himself a most resolute supporter of Caecilius Metellus,\n\t\t\t\t\ttribune of the people, who, in spite of all opposition from his colleagues, had\n\t\t\t\t\tproposed some laws of a violent tendency, until\n\t\t\t\t\tthey were both dismissed from office by a vote of the senate. He ventured,\n\t\t\t\t\tnotwithstanding, to retain his post and continue in the administration of\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice; but finding that preparations were made to obstruct him by force of\n\t\t\t\t\tarms, he dismissed the lictors, threw off his gown, and betook himself privately\n\t\t\t\t\tto his own house, with the resolution of being quiet, in a time so unfavourable\n\t\t\t\t\tto his interests. He likewise pacified the mob, which two days afterwards\n\t\t\t\t\tflocked about him, and in a riotous manner made a voluntary tender of their\n\t\t\t\t\tassistance in the vindication of his honour. This happening contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\texpectation, the senate, who met in haste, on account of the tumult, gave him\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir thanks by some of the leading members of the house, and sending for him,\n\t\t\t\t\tafter high commendation of his conduct, cancelled their former vote, and\n\t\t\t\t\trestored him to his office. \n\t\t\t",
        "16":"\n\t\t\t\t But he soon got into fresh trouble, being named amongst the accomplices of\n\t\t\t\t\tCatiline, both before Novius Niger the quaestor, by Lucius Vettius the informer,\n\t\t\t\t\tand in the senate by Quintus Curius; to whom a reward had been voted, for having\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst discovered the designs of the conspirators. Curius affirmed that he had\n\t\t\t\t\treceived his information from Catiline. Vettius even engaged to produce in\n\t\t\t\t\tevidence against him his own hand-writing, given to Catiline. Caesar, feeling\n\t\t\t\t\tthat this treatment was not to be borne, appealed to Cicero himself, whether he\n\t\t\t\t\thad not voluntarily made a discovery to him of some particulars of the\n\t\t\t\t\tconspiracy; and so baulked Curius of his expected reward. He, therefore, obliged\n\t\t\t\t\tVettius to give pledges for his behaviour, seized his goods, and after heavily\n\t\t\t\t\tfining him, and seeing him almost torn in pieces before the rostra, threw him\n\t\t\t\t\tinto prison; to which he likewise sent Novius the quaestor, for having presumed\n\t\t\t\t\tto take an information against a magistrate of superior authority. \n\t\t\t",
        "17":"\n\t\t\t\t At the expiration of his praetorship he obtained by lot the Farther- Spain , and pacified his creditors, who were for\n\t\t\t\t\tdetaining him, by finding sureties for his debts. Contrary, however, to both\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw and custom, he took his departure before the usual equipage and outfit were\n\t\t\t\t\tprepared. It is uncertain whether this precipitancy arose from the apprehension\n\t\t\t\t\tof an impeachment, with which he was threatened on the expiration of his former\n\t\t\t\t\toffice, or from his anxiety to lose no time in relieving the allies, who\n\t\t\t\t\timplored him to come to their aid. He had no sooner established tranquillity in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe province, than, without waiting for the arrival of his successor, he\n\t\t\t\t\treturned to Rome , with equal haste, to\n\t\t\t\t\tsue for a triumph, and the consulship. The day of election, however, being already fixed by\n\t\t\t\t\tproclamation, he could not legally be admitted a candidate, unless he entered\n\t\t\t\t\tthe city as a private person. On this emergency he solicited a suspension of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe laws in his favour; but such an indulgence being strongly opposed, he found\n\t\t\t\t\thimself under the necessity of abandoning all thoughts of a triumph, lest he\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be disappointed of the consulship. \n\t\t\t",
        "18":"\n\t\t\t\t Of the two other competitors for the consulship, Lucius Luceius and Marcus\n\t\t\t\t\tBibulus, he joined with the former, upon condition that Luceius, being a man of\n\t\t\t\t\tless interest, but greater affluence, should promise money to the electors, in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir joint names. Upon which the party of the nobles, dreading how far he might\n\t\t\t\t\tcarry matters in that high office, with a colleague disposed to concur in and\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond his measures, advised Bibulus to promise the voters as much as the other;\n\t\t\t\t\tand most of them contributed towards the expense, Cato himself admitting that\n\t\t\t\t\tbribery, under such circumstances, was for the public good. \n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accordingly elected consul jointly with Bibulus. Actuated still by the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame motives, the prevailing party took care to assign provinces of small\n\t\t\t\t\timportance to the new consuls, such as the care of the woods and roads. Caesar,\n\t\t\t\t\tincensed at this indignity, endeavoured by the most assiduous and flattering\n\t\t\t\t\tattentions to gain to his side Cneius Pompey, at that time dissatisfied with the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenate for the backwardness they showed to confirm his acts, after his victories\n\t\t\t\t\tover Mithridates. He likewise brought about a reconciliation between Pompey and\n\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Crassus, who had been at variance from the time of their joint\n\t\t\t\t\tconsulship. in which office they were continually clashing; and he entered into\n\t\t\t\t\tan agreement with both, that nothing should be transacted in the government,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich was displeasing to any of the three. \n\t\t\t",
        "19":"\n\t\t\t\t Having entered upon his office, he\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduced a new regulation, that the daily acts both of the senate and people\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be committed to writing, and published. He also revived an old custom, that an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tofficer should precede him, and his lictors follow him, on the\n\t\t\t\t\talternate months when the fasces were not carried before him. Upon preferring a\n\t\t\t\t\tbill to the people for the division of some public lands, he was opposed by his\n\t\t\t\t\tcolleague, whom he violently drove out of the forum. Next day the insulted\n\t\t\t\t\tconsul made a complaint in the senate of this treatment; but such was the\n\t\t\t\t\tconsternation, that no one having the courage to bring the matter forward or\n\t\t\t\t\tmove a censure, which had been often done under outrages of less importance, he\n\t\t\t\t\twas so much dispirited, that until the expiration of his office he never stirred\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom home, and did nothing but issue edicts to obstruct his colleague's\n\t\t\t\t\tproceedings. From that time, therefore, Caesar had the sole management of public\n\t\t\t\t\taffairs; insomuch that some wags, when they signed any instrument as witnesses,\n\t\t\t\t\tdid not add \" in the consulship of Caesar and Bibulus,\" but, \"of Julius and\n\t\t\t\t\tCaesar;\" putting the same person down twice, under his name and surname. The\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowing verses likewise were currently repeated on this occasion: Non Bibulo quidquam nuper, sed Caesare factum est; \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Nam Bibulo fieri consule nil memini. \n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing was done in Bibulus's year: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t No; Caesar only then was consul here. The land of Stellas,\n\t\t\t\t\tconsecrated by our ancestors to the gods, with some other lands in Campania left subject to tribute, for the\n\t\t\t\t\tsupport of the expenses of the government, he divided, but not by lot, among\n\t\t\t\t\tupwards of twenty thousand freemen, who had each of them three or more children.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe eased the publicans, upon their petition, of a third part of the sum which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey had engaged to pay into the public treasury; and openly admonished them not\n\t\t\t\t\tto bid so extravagantly upon the next occasion. He made various profuse grants\n\t\t\t\t\tto meet the wishes of others, no one opposing him; or if any such attempt was\n\t\t\t\t\tmade, it was soon suppressed. Marcus Cato, who interrupted him in his\n\t\t\t\t\tproceedings, he ordered to be dragged out of the senate-house by a lictor, and\n\t\t\t\t\tcarried to prison. Lucius Lucullus, likewise, for opposing him with some warmth.\n\t\t\t\t\the so terrified with the apprehension of being criminated, that to deprecate the\n\t\t\t\t\tconsul's resentment, he fell on his knees. And upon Cicero's lamenting in some\n\t\t\t\t\ttrial the miserable condition of the times, he the very same day, by nine\n\t\t\t\t\to'clock, transferred his enemy, Publius Clodius, from a patrician to a plebeian\n\t\t\t\t\tfamily; a change which he had long solicited in vain. At\n\t\t\t\t\tlast, effectually to intimidate all those of the opposite party, he by great\n\t\t\t\t\trewards prevailed upon Vettius to declare, that he had been solicited by certain\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons to assassinate Pompey; and when he was brought before the rostra to name\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who had been concerted between them, after naming one or two to no\n\t\t\t\t\tpurpose, not without great suspicion of subornation, Caesar, despairing of\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccess in this rash stratagem, is supposed to have taken off his informer by\n\t\t\t\t\tpoison. \n\t\t\t",
        "20":"\n\t\t\t\t About the same time he married Calpurnia, the daughter of Lucius Piso, who was to\n\t\t\t\t\tsucceed him in the consulship, and gave his own daughter Julia to Cneius Pompey;\n\t\t\t\t\trejecting Servilius Caepio, to whom she had been contracted, and by whose means\n\t\t\t\t\tchiefly he had but a little before baffled Bibulus. After this new alliance, he\n\t\t\t\t\tbegan, upon any debates in the senate, to ask Pompey's opinion first, whereas he\n\t\t\t\t\tused before to give that distinction to Marcus Crassus; and it was the usual\n\t\t\t\t\tpractice for the consul to observe throughout the year the method of consulting\n\t\t\t\t\tthe senate which he had adopted on the calends (the first) of January. \n\t\t\t",
        "21":"\n\t\t\t\t Being, therefore, now supported by the interest of his father-in-law and\n\t\t\t\t\tson-in-law, of all the provinces he made choice of Gaul , as most likely to furnish him with matter and occasion\n\t\t\t\t\tfor triumphs. At first indeed he received only Cisalpine- Gaul , with the addition of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Illyricum , by a decree proposed by\n\t\t\t\t\tVatinius to the people; but soon afterwards obtained from the senate\n\t\t\t\t\tGallia-Comata also, the senators being apprehensive, that if they should refuse\n\t\t\t\t\tit to him, that province, also, would be granted him by the people. Elated now\n\t\t\t\t\twith his success, he could not refrain from boasting, a few days afterwards, in\n\t\t\t\t\ta full senate-house, that he had, in spite of his enemies, and to their great\n\t\t\t\t\tmortification, obtained all he desired, and that for the future he would make\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, to their shame, submissive to his pleasure. One of the senators observing,\n\t\t\t\t\tsarcastically: \"That will not be very easy for a woman to do,\" he jocosely\n\t\t\t\t\treplied, \"Semiramis formerly reigned in Assyria, and the Amazons possessed great\n\t\t\t\t\tpart of Asia .\" \n\t\t\t",
        "22":"\n\t\t\t\t When the term of his consulship had expired, upon a motion being made in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenate by Caius Memmius and Lucius Domitius, the praetors, respecting the\n\t\t\t\t\ttransactions of the year past, he offered to refer himself to the house; but\n\t\t\t\t\tthey declining the business, after three days spent in vain altercation, he set\n\t\t\t\t\tout for his province. Immediately, however, his quaestor was charged with\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral misdemeanors, for the purpose of implicating Caesar himself. Indeed, an\n\t\t\t\t\taccusation was soon after preferred against him by Lucius Antistius, tribune of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people; but by making an appeal to the tribune's colleagues, he succeeded in\n\t\t\t\t\thaving the prosecution suspended during this absence in the service of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate. To secure himself, therefore, for the time to come, he was particularly\n\t\t\t\t\tcareful to secure the good-will of the magistrates at the annual elections,\n\t\t\t\t\tassisting none of the candidates with his interest, nor suffering any persons to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe advanced to any office, who would not positively undertake to defend him in\n\t\t\t\t\this absence: for which purpose he made no scruple to require of some of them an\n\t\t\t\t\toath, and even a written obligation. \n\t\t\t",
        "23":"\n\t\t\t\t But when Lucius Domitius became a candidate for the consulship, and openly\n\t\t\t\t\tthreatened that, upon his being elected consul, he would effect that which he\n\t\t\t\t\tcould not accomplish when he was praetor, and divest him of the command of the\n\t\t\t\t\tarmies, he sent for Crassus and Pompey to Lucca , a city in his province, and pressed them, for the\n\t\t\t\t\tpurpose of disappointing Domitius, to sue again for the consulship, and to\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinue him in his command for five years longer: with both which requisitions\n\t\t\t\t\tthey complied. Presumptuous now with his success, he added, at his own private\n\t\t\t\t\tcharge, more legions to those which he had received from the republic; among the\n\t\t\t\t\tformer of which was one levied in Transalpine Gaul, and called by a Gallic name,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlauda, which he\n\t\t\t\t\ttrained and armed in the Roman fashion, and afterwards conferred on it the\n\t\t\t\t\tfreedom of the city. From this period he declined no occasion of war, however\n\t\t\t\t\tunjust and dangerous; attacking, without any provocation, as well the allies of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Rome as the barbarous nations\n\t\t\t\t\twhich were its enemies: insomuch, that the senate passed a decree for sending\n\t\t\t\t\tcommissioners to examine into the condition of Gaul ; and some members even proposed that he should be\n\t\t\t\t\tdelivered up to the enemy. But so great had been the success of his enterprises,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he had the honour of obtaining more days of supplication, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthose more frequently, than had ever before been decreed to any commander. \n\t\t\t",
        "24":"\n\t\t\t\t During nine years in which he held the government of the province, his\n\t\t\t\t\tachievements were as follows: he reduced all Gaul , bounded by the Pyrenean forest, the Alps , mount Gebenna, and the two rivers, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Rhine and the Rhone , and being about three thousand two\n\t\t\t\t\thundred miles in compass, into the form of a province, excepting only the\n\t\t\t\t\tnations in alliance with the republic, and such as had merited his favour;\n\t\t\t\t\timposing upon this new acquisition an annual tribute of forty millions of\n\t\t\t\t\tsesterces. He was the first of the Romans who, crossing the Rhine by a bridge, attacked the Germanic\n\t\t\t\t\ttribes inhabiting the country beyond that river, whom he defeated in several\n\t\t\t\t\tengagements. He also invaded the Britons, a people formerly unknown, and having\n\t\t\t\t\tvanquished them, exacted from them contributions and hostages. Amidst such a\n\t\t\t\t\tseries of successes, he experienced thrice only any signal disaster; once in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Britain , when his fleet was nearly\n\t\t\t\t\twrecked in a storm; in Gaul , at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Gergovia , where one of his legions\n\t\t\t\t\twas put to the rout; and in the territory of the Germans, his lieutenants\n\t\t\t\t\tTiturius and Aurunculeius were cut off by an ambuscade. \n\t\t\t",
        "25":"\n\t\t\t\t During this period he lost his\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmother, whose death was followed by that\n\t\t\t\t\tof his daughter, and, not long afterwards, of his granddaughter. Meanwhile,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe republic being in consternation at the murder of Publius Clodius, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenate passing a vote that only one consul, namely, Cneius Pompeius, should be\n\t\t\t\t\tchosen for the ensuing year, he prevailed with the tribunes of the people, who\n\t\t\t\t\tintended joining him in nomination with Pompey, to propose to the people a bill,\n\t\t\t\t\tenabling him, though absent, to become a candidate for his second consulship,\n\t\t\t\t\twhen the term of his command should be near expiring, that he might not be\n\t\t\t\t\tobliged on that account to quit his province too soon, and before the conclusion\n\t\t\t\t\tof the war. Having attained this object, carrying his views still higher, and\n\t\t\t\t\tanimated with the hopes of success, he omitted no opportunity of gaining\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal favour, by acts of liberality and kindness to individuals, both in\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic and private. With money raised from the spoils of the war, he began to\n\t\t\t\t\tconstruct a new forum, the ground-plot of which cost him above a hundred\n\t\t\t\t\tmillions of sesterces. He promised the people a\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic entertainment of gladiators, and a feast in memory of his daughter, such\n\t\t\t\t\tas no one before him had ever given. The more to raise their expectations on\n\t\t\t\t\tthis occasion, although he had agreed with victuallers of all denominations for\n\t\t\t\t\this feast, he made yet farther preparations in private houses. He issued an\n\t\t\t\t\torder, that the most celebrated gladiators, if at any time during the combat\n\t\t\t\t\tthey incurred the displeasure of the public, should be immediately carried off\n\t\t\t\t\tby force, and reserved for some future occasion. Young gladiators he trained up,\n\t\t\t\t\tnot in the school, and by the masters, of defence, but in the houses of Roman\n\t\t\t\t\tknights, and even senators, skilled in the use of arms, earnestly requesting\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, as appears from his letters, to undertake the discipline of those\n\t\t\t\t\tnovitiates, and to give them the word during their exercises. He doubled the pay\n\t\t\t\t\tof the legions in perpetuity; allowing them likewise corn, when it was in\n\t\t\t\t\tplenty, without any restriction; and sometimes distributing to every soldier in\n\t\t\t\t\this army a slave, and a portion of land. \n\t\t\t",
        "26":"\n\t\t\t\t To maintain his alliance, and good understanding with Pompey, he offered him in\n\t\t\t\t\tmarriage his sister's grand-daughter Octavia, who had been married to Caius\n\t\t\t\t\tMarcellus; and requested for himself his daughter, lately contracted to Faustus\n\t\t\t\t\tSylla. Every person about him, and a great part likewise of the senate, he\n\t\t\t\t\tsecured by loans of money at low interest, or none at all; and to all others who\n\t\t\t\t\tcame to wait upon him, either by invitation or of their own accord, he made\n\t\t\t\t\tliberal presents; not neglecting even the freedmen and slaves, who were\n\t\t\t\t\tfavourites with their masters and patrons. He offered also singular and ready\n\t\t\t\t\taid to all who were under prosecution, or in debt, and to prodigal youths;\n\t\t\t\t\texcluding from his bounty those only who were so deeply plunged in guilt,\n\t\t\t\t\tpoverty, or luxury, that it was impossible effectually to relieve them. These,\n\t\t\t\t\the openly declared, could derive no benefit from any other means than a civil\n\t\t\t\t\twar. \n\t\t\t",
        "27":"\n\t\t\t\t He endeavoured with equal assiduity to engage in his interest princes and\n\t\t\t\t\tprovinces in every part of the world: presenting some with thousands of\n\t\t\t\t\tcaptives, and sending to others the assistance of troops, at whatever time and\n\t\t\t\t\tplace they desired, without any authority from either the senate or people of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Rome . He likewise embellished with\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnificent public buildings the most powerful cities not only of Italy , Gaul , and Spain , but\n\t\t\t\t\tof Greece and Asia ; until all people being now astonished,\n\t\t\t\t\tand speculating on the obvious tendency of these proceedings, Claudius\n\t\t\t\t\tMarcellus, the consul, declaring first by proclamation, that he intended to\n\t\t\t\t\tpropose a measure of the utmost importance to the state, made a motion in the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenate that some person should be appointed to succeed Caesar in his province,\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore the term of his command was expired; because the war being brought to a\n\t\t\t\t\tconclusion, peace was restored, and the victorious army ought to be disbanded.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe further moved, that Caesar being absent, his claims to be a candidate at the\n\t\t\t\t\tnext election of consuls, should not be admitted, as Pompey himself had\n\t\t\t\t\tafterwards abrogated that privilege by a decree of the people. The fact was,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Pompey, in his law relating to the choice of chief magistrates, had forgot\n\t\t\t\t\tto except Caesar, in the article in which he declared all such as were not\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent incapable of being candidates for any office; but soon afterwards, when\n\t\t\t\t\tthe law was inscribed on brass, and deposited in the treasury, he corrected his\n\t\t\t\t\tmistake. Marcellus, not content with depriving Caesar of his provinces, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tprivilege intended him by Pompey, likewise moved the senate, that the freedom of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe city should be taken from those colonists whom, by the Vatinian law, he had\n\t\t\t\t\tsettled at New Como; because it had been conferred upon them with ambitious views, and by a\n\t\t\t\t\tstretch of the laws. \n\t\t\t",
        "28":"\n\t\t\t\t Roused by these proceedings, and thinking, as he was often heard to say, that it\n\t\t\t\t\twould be a more difficult enterprise to reduce him, now that he was the chief\n\t\t\t\t\tman in the state, from the first rank of citizens to the second, than from the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond to the lowest of all, Caesar made a vigorous opposition to the measure,\n\t\t\t\t\tpartly by means of the tribunes, who interposed in his behalf, and partly\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough Servius Sulpicius, the other consul. The following year likewise, when\n\t\t\t\t\tCaius Marcellus, who succeeded his cousin Marcus in the consulship, pursued the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame course, Caesar, by means of an immense bribe, engaged in his defence\n\t\t\t\t\tAEmilius Paulus, the other consul, and Caius Curio, the most violent of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttribunes. But finding the opposition obstinately bent against him, and that the\n\t\t\t\t\tconsuls-elect were also of that party, he wrote a letter to the senate,\n\t\t\t\t\trequesting that they would not deprive him of the privilege kindly granted him\n\t\t\t\t\tby the people; or else that the other generals should resign the command of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir armies as well as himself; fully persuaded, as it is thought, that he\n\t\t\t\t\tcould more easily collect his veteran soldiers, whenever he pleased, than Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\tcould his new-raised troops. At the same time, he made his adversaries an offer\n\t\t\t\t\tto disband eight of his legions and give up Transalpine-Gaul, on condition that\n\t\t\t\t\the might retain two legions, with the Cisalpine province, or but one legion with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Illyricum , until he should be\n\t\t\t\t\telected consul. \n\t\t\t",
        "29":"\n\t\t\t\t But as the senate declined to interpose in the business, and his enemies declared\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they would enter into no compromise where the safety of the republic was at\n\t\t\t\t\tstake, he advanced into Hither-Gaul, \n\t\t\t\t\tand, having gone to the circuit for the administration of justice, made a halt\n\t\t\t\t\tat Ravenna , resolved to have\n\t\t\t\t\trecourse to arms if the senate should proceed to extremity against the tribunes\n\t\t\t\t\tof the people who had espoused his cause. This was indeed his pretext for the\n\t\t\t\t\tcivil war; but it is supposed that there were other motives for his conduct.\n\t\t\t\t\tCneius Pompey used frequently to say, that he sought to throw every thing into\n\t\t\t\t\tconfusion, because he was unable, with all his private wealth, to complete the\n\t\t\t\t\tworks he had begun, and answer, at his return, the vast expectations which he\n\t\t\t\t\thad excited in the people. Others pretend that he was apprehensive of being\n\t\t\t\t\tcalled to account for what he had done in his protests of the tribunes; Marcus\n\t\t\t\t\tCato having sometimes declared, and that, too, with an oath, that he would\n\t\t\t\t\tprefer an impeachment against him, as soon as he disbanded his ·army. A report\n\t\t\t\t\tlikewise prevailed, that if he returned as a private person, he would, like\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Milo , have to plead his cause\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore the judges, surrounded by armed men. This conjecture is rendered highly\n\t\t\t\t\tprobable by Asinius Pollio, who informs us that Caesar, upon viewing the\n\t\t\t\t\tvanquished and slaughtered enemy in the field of Pharsalia, expressed himself in\n\t\t\t\t\tthese very words: \" This was their intention: I, Caius Caesar, after all the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat achievements I had performed, must have been condemned, had I not summoned\n\t\t\t\t\tthe army to my aid !\" Some think, that having contracted from long habit an\n\t\t\t\t\textraordinary love of power, and having weighed his own and his enemies'\n\t\t\t\t\tstrength, he embraced that occasion of usurping the supreme power; which indeed\n\t\t\t\t\the had coveted from the time of his youth. This seems to have been the opinion\n\t\t\t\t\tentertained by Cicero, who tells us, in the third book of his Offices, that\n\t\t\t\t\tCaesar used to have frequently in his mouth two verses of Euripides, which he\n\t\t\t\t\tthus translates: Nam si violandum est jus, regnandi\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgratia \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Violandum est: aiis rebus pietatem colas. \n\t\t\t\t\t Be just, unless a kingdom tempts to break the laws, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t For sovereign power alone can justify the cause. \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t",
        "30":"\n\t\t\t\t When intelligence, therefore, was received, that the interposition of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttribunes in his favour had been utterly rejected, and that they themselves had\n\t\t\t\t\tfled from the city, he immediately sent forward some cohorts, but privately, to\n\t\t\t\t\tprevent any suspicion of his design; and, to keep up appearances, attended at a\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic spectacle, examined the model of a fencing-school which he proposed to\n\t\t\t\t\tbuild, and, as usual, sat down to table with a numerous party of his friends.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut after sun-set, mules being put to his carriage from a neighbouring mill, he\n\t\t\t\t\tset forward on his journey with all possible privacy, and a small retinue. The\n\t\t\t\t\tlights going out, he lost his way, and wandered a long time, until at length, by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe help of a guide, whom he found towards day-break, he proceeded on foot\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough some narrow paths, and again reached the road. Coming up with his troops\n\t\t\t\t\ton the banks of the Rubicon, which was the boundary of his province, he halted for a while, and, revolving in his\n\t\t\t\t\tmind the importance of the step he was on the point of taking, he turned to\n\t\t\t\t\tthose about him, and said: \"We may still retreat: but if we pass this little\n\t\t\t\t\tbridge, nothing is left for us but to fight it out in arms.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "31":"\n\t\t\t\t While he was thus hesitating, the following incident occurred. A person\n\t\t\t\t\tremarkable for his noble mien and graceful aspect, appeared close at hand,\n\t\t\t\t\tsitting and playing upon a pipe. When, not only the shepherds, but a number of\n\t\t\t\t\tsoldiers also flocked from their posts to listen to him, and some trumpeters\n\t\t\t\t\tamong them, he snatched a trumpet from one of them, ran to the river with it,\n\t\t\t\t\tand sounding the advance with a piercing blast, crossed to the other side. Upon\n\t\t\t\t\tthis, Caesar exclaimed, \" Let us go where the omens of the Gods and the iniquity\n\t\t\t\t\tof our enemies call us. The die is now cast.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "32":"\n\t\t\t\t Accordingly, having marched his army over the river, he shewed them the tribunes\n\t\t\t\t\tof the people, who, upon their being driven from the city, had come to meet him;\n\t\t\t\t\tand, in the presence of that assembly, called upon the troops to pledge him\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir fidelity, with tears in his eyes, and his garment rent from his bosom. It\n\t\t\t\t\thas been supposed, that upon this occasion he promised to every soldier a\n\t\t\t\t\tknight's estate; but that opinion is founded on a mistake. For when, in his\n\t\t\t\t\tharangue to them, he frequently held out a finger of his left hand, and declared, that to recompense those who should\n\t\t\t\t\tsupport him in the defence of his honor, he would willingly part even with his\n\t\t\t\t\tring; the soldiers at a distance, who could more easily see than hear him while\n\t\t\t\t\the spoke, formed their conception of what he said, by the eye, not by the ear;\n\t\t\t\t\tand accordingly gave out, that he had promised to each of them the privilege of\n\t\t\t\t\twearing the gold ring, and an estate of four hundred thousand sesterces. \n\t\t\t",
        "33":"\n\t\t\t\t Of his subsequent proceedings I shall give a cursory detail, in the order in\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they occurred. He took possession\n\t\t\t\t\tof Picenum, Umbria , and Etruria; and\n\t\t\t\t\thaving obliged Lucius Domitius, who had been tumultuously nominated his\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccessor, and held Corsinium with a garrison, to surrender, and dismissed him,\n\t\t\t\t\the marched along the coast of the Upper Sea, to Brundusium , to which place the consuls\n\t\t\t\t\tand Pompey were fled with the intention of crossing the sea as soon as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter vain attempts, by all the obstacles he could oppose, to prevent their\n\t\t\t\t\tleaving the harbour, he turned his steps towards Rome , where he appealed to the senate on the present state of\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic affairs; and then set out for Spain , in which province Pompey had a numerous army, under the\n\t\t\t\t\tcommand of three lieutenants, Marcus Petreius, Lucius Afranius, and Marcus\n\t\t\t\t\tVarro; declaring amongst his friends, before he set forward, \"That he was going\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst an army without a general, and should return thence against ra general\n\t\t\t\t\twithout an army.\" Though his progress was retarded both by the siege of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Marseilles , which shut her agates\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst him, and a very great scarcity of corn, yet in a short time he bore down\n\t\t\t\t\tall before him. \n\t\t\t",
        "34":"\n\t\t\t\t Thence he returned to Rome , and\n\t\t\t\t\tcrossing the sea to Macedonia , blocked\n\t\t\t\t\tup Pompey during almost four months, within a line of ramparts of prodigious\n\t\t\t\t\textent; and at last defeated him in the battle of Pharsalia. Pursuing him in his\n\t\t\t\t\tflight to Alexandria , where he\n\t\t\t\t\twas tinformed of his murder, he presently found himself also engaged, under all\n\t\t\t\t\tthe disadvantages of time and place, in a very dangerous war, with king Ptolemy,\n\t\t\t\t\twho, he saw, had treacherous designs upon his life. It was winter, and he,\n\t\t\t\t\twithin the walls of a well-provided and subtle enemy, was destitute of every\n\t\t\t\t\tthing, and wholly unprepared for such a conflict. He succeeded, however, in his\n\t\t\t\t\tenterprise, and put the kingdom of Egypt into the hands of Cleopatra and her younger brother;\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing afraid to make it a province, lest, under an aspiring prefect, it might\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome the centre of revolt. From Alexandria he went into Syria , and thence to Pontus , induced by intelligence which he had received\n\t\t\t\t\trespecting Pharnaces. This prince, who was son of the great Mithridates, had\n\t\t\t\t\tseized the opportunity which the distraction of the times offered for making war\n\t\t\t\t\tupon his neighbours, and his insolence and fierceness had grown with his\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccess. Caesar, however, within five days after entering his country, and four\n\t\t\t\t\thours after coming in sight of him, overthrew him in one decisive battle. Upon\n\t\t\t\t\twhich, he frequently remarked to those about him the good fortune of Pompey, who\n\t\t\t\t\thad obtained his military reputation, chiefly, by victory over so feeble an\n\t\t\t\t\tenemy. He afterwards defeated Scipio and Juba, who were rallying the remains of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe party in Africa , and Pompey's sons\n\t\t\t\t\tin Spain . \n\t\t\t",
        "35":"\n\t\t\t\t During the whole course of the civil war, he never once suffered any defeat,\n\t\t\t\t\texcept in the case of his lieutenants; of whom Caius Curio fell in Africa , Caius Antonius was made prisoner in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Illyricum , Publius Dolabella lost a\n\t\t\t\t\tfleet in the same Illyricum , and Cneius\n\t\t\t\t\tDomitius Calvinus, an army in Pontus .\n\t\t\t\t\tIn every encounter with the enemy where he himself commanded, he came off with\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplete success; nor was the issue ever doubtful, except on two occasions: once\n\t\t\t\t\tat Dyrrachium , when, being obliged to\n\t\t\t\t\tgive ground, and Pompey not pursuing his advantage, he said that \"Pompey knew\n\t\t\t\t\tnot how to conquer;\" the other instance occurred in his last battle in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Spain , when, despairing of the\n\t\t\t\t\tevent, he even had thoughts of killing himself. \n\t\t\t",
        "36":"\n\t\t\t\t For the victories obtained in the several wars, he triumphed five different\n\t\t\t\t\ttimes; after the defeat of Scipio four times in one month, each triumph\n\t\t\t\t\tsucceeding the former by an interval of a few days; and once again after the\n\t\t\t\t\tconquest of Pompey's sons. His first and most glorious triumph was for the\n\t\t\t\t\tvictories he gained in Gaul ; the next\n\t\t\t\t\tfor that of Alexandria , the\n\t\t\t\t\tthird for the reduction of Pontus , the\n\t\t\t\t\tfourth for his African victory, and the last for that in Spain ; and they all differed from each other\n\t\t\t\t\tin their varied pomp and pageantry. On the day of the Gallic triumph, as he was\n\t\t\t\t\tproceeding along the street called Velabrum, after narrowly escaping a fall from\n\t\t\t\t\this chariot by the breaking of an axle-tree, he as cended the Capitol by\n\t\t\t\t\ttorch-light, forty elephants carrying torches on his right and\n\t\t\t\t\tleft. Amongst the pageantry of the Pontic triumph, a tablet with this\n\t\t\t\t\tinscription was carried before him: I CAME, I SAW, I CONQUERED; not\n\t\t\t\t\tsignifying, as other mottos on the like occasion, what was done, so much as the\n\t\t\t\t\tdispatch with which it was done. \n\t\t\t",
        "37":"\n\t\t\t\t To every foot soldier in his veteran legions, besides the two thousand sesterces\n\t\t\t\t\tpaid him in the beginning of the civil war, he gave twenty thousand more, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tshape of prize-money. He likewise allotted them lands, but not in contiguity,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the former owners might not be entirely dispossessed. To the people of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Rome , besides ten modii of corn,\n\t\t\t\t\tand as many pounds of oil, he gave three hundred sesterces a man, which he had\n\t\t\t\t\tformerly promised them, and a hundred more to each for the delay in fulfilling\n\t\t\t\t\this engagement. He likewise remitted a year's rent due to the treasury, for such\n\t\t\t\t\thouses in Rome as did not pay above\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo thousand sesterces a year; and through the rest of Italy , for all such as did not exceed in\n\t\t\t\t\tyearly rent five hundred sesterces. To all this he added a public entertainment,\n\t\t\t\t\tand a distribution of meat, and, after his Spanish victory, two public dinners. For, considering the first he had\n\t\t\t\t\tgiven as too sparing, and unsuited to his profuse liberality, he, five days\n\t\t\t\t\tafterwards, added another, which was most plentiful. \n\t\t\t",
        "38":"\n\t\t\t\t The spectacles he exhibited to the people were of various kinds; namely. a combat\n\t\t\t\t\tof gladiators, and stage-plays in the\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral wards of the city, and in different languages; likewise Circensian\n\t\t\t\t\tgames, wrestlers, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe representation of a sea-fight. In the conflict of gladiators presented in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Forum, Furius Leptinus, a man of praetorian family, entered the lists as a\n\t\t\t\t\tcombatant, as did also Quintus Calpenus, formerly a senator, and a pleader of\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses. The Pyrrhic dance was performed by some youths, who were sons to persons\n\t\t\t\t\tol the first distinction in Asia and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Bithynia . In the plays, Decimus\n\t\t\t\t\tLaberius, who had been a Roman knight, acted in his own piece; and being\n\t\t\t\t\tpresented on the spot with five hundred thousand sesterces, and a gold ring, he\n\t\t\t\t\twent from the stage, through the orchestra, and resumed his place in the seats\n\t\t\t\t\tallotted for the equestrian order. In the Circensian games, the circus being\n\t\t\t\t\tenlarged at each end, and a canal sunk round it, several of the young nobility\n\t\t\t\t\tdrove chariots, drawn, some by four, and others by two horses, and likewise rode\n\t\t\t\t\traces on single horses. The Trojan game was acted by two distinct companies of\n\t\t\t\t\tboys, one differing from the other in age and rank. The hunting of wild beasts\n\t\t\t\t\twas presented for five days successively; and on the last day a battle was\n\t\t\t\t\tfought by five hundred foot, twenty elephants, and thirty horse on each side. To\n\t\t\t\t\tafford room for this engagement, the goals were removed, and in their space two\n\t\t\t\t\tcamps were pitched, directly opposite to each other. Wrestlers likewise\n\t\t\t\t\tperformed for three days successively, in a stadium provided for the purpose in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Campus Martius . A lake having, been\n\t\t\t\t\tdug in the little Codeta, ships of the Tyrian and Egyptian\n\t\t\t\t\tfleets, containing two, three, and four banks of oars, with a number of men on\n\t\t\t\t\tboard, afforded an animated representation of a sea-fight. To these various\n\t\t\t\t\tdiversions there flocked such crowds of spectators from all parts, that most of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe strangers were obliged to lodge in tents erected in the streets, or along\n\t\t\t\t\tthe roads near the city. Several in the throng were squeezed to death, amongst\n\t\t\t\t\twhom were two senators. \n\t\t\t",
        "39":"\n\t\t\t\t Turning afterwards his attention to the regulation of the commonwealth, he\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrected the calendar, which had for some time become extremely confused, through the\n\t\t\t\t\tunwarrantable liberty which the pontiffs had taken in the article of\n\t\t\t\t\tintercalation. To such a height had this abuse proceeded, that neither the\n\t\t\t\t\tfestivals designed for the harvest fell in summer, nor those for the vintage in\n\t\t\t\t\tautumn. He accommodated the year to the course of the sun, ordaining that in\n\t\t\t\t\tfuture it should consist of three hundred and sixty-five days without any\n\t\t\t\t\tintercalary month; and that every fourth year an intercalary day should be\n\t\t\t\t\tinserted. That the year might thenceforth commence regularly with the calends,\n\t\t\t\t\tor first of January, he inserted two months between November and December; so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the year in which this regulation was made consisted of fifteen months,\n\t\t\t\t\tincluding the month of intercalation. which, according to the division of time\n\t\t\t\t\tthen in use, happened that year. \n\t\t\t",
        "40":"\n\t\t\t\t He filled up the vacancies in the senate, by advancing several plebeians to the\n\t\t\t\t\trank of patricians, and also increased the number of praetors, aediles,\n\t\t\t\t\tquaestors, and inferior magistrates; restoring, at the same time, such as had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen degraded by the censors, or convicted of bribery at elections. The choice\n\t\t\t\t\tof magistrates he so divided with the people, that, excepting only the\n\t\t\t\t\tcandidates for the consulship, they nominated one half of them, and he the\n\t\t\t\t\tother. The method which he practised in those cases was, to recommend such\n\t\t\t\t\tpersons as he had pitched upon, by bills dispersed through the several tribes to\n\t\t\t\t\tthis effect: \"Caesar the dictator to such a tribe (naming it). I recommend to\n\t\t\t\t\tyou (naming likewise the persons), that by the favour of your votes they may\n\t\t\t\t\tattain to the honours for which they sue.\" He likewise admitted to offices the\n\t\t\t\t\tsons of those who had been proscribed. The trial of causes he restricted to two\n\t\t\t\t\torders of judges, the equestrian and senatorial; excluding the tribunes of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttreasury who had before made a third class. The revised census of the people he\n\t\t\t\t\tordered to be taken neither in the usual manner or place, but street by street,\n\t\t\t\t\tby the principal inhabitants of the several quarters of the city; and he reduced\n\t\t\t\t\tthe number of those who received corn at the public cost, from three hundred and\n\t\t\t\t\ttwenty, to a hundred and fifty, thousand. To prevent any tumults on account of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe census, he ordered that the praetor should every year fill up by lot the\n\t\t\t\t\tvacancies occasioned by death, from those who were not enrolled for the receipt\n\t\t\t\t\tof corn. \n\t\t\t",
        "41":"\n\t\t\t\t Eighty thousand citizens having been distributed into foreign colonies, he enacted, in order to stop the drain on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe population, that no freeman of the city above twenty, and under forty, years\n\t\t\t\t\tof age, who was not in the military service, should absent himself from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Italy for more than three years at\n\t\t\t\t\ta time; that no senator's son should go abroad, unless in the retinue of some\n\t\t\t\t\thigh officer; and as to those whose pursuit was tending flocks and herds, that\n\t\t\t\t\tno less than a third of the number of their shepherds free-born should be\n\t\t\t\t\tyouths. He likewise made all those who practised physic in Rome , and all teachers of the liberal arts,\n\t\t\t\t\tfree of the city, in order to fix them in it, and induce others to settle there.\n\t\t\t\t\tWith respect to debts, he disappointed the expectation which was generally\n\t\t\t\t\tentertained, that they would be totally cancelled; and ordered that the debtors\n\t\t\t\t\tshould satisfy their creditors, according to the valuation of their estates, at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rate at which they were purchased before the commencement of the civil war;\n\t\t\t\t\tdeducting from the debt what had been paid for interest either in money or by\n\t\t\t\t\tbonds; by virtue of which provision about a fourth part of the debt was lost. He\n\t\t\t\t\tdissolved all the guilds, except such as were of ancient foundation. Crimes were\n\t\t\t\t\tpunished with greater severity; and the rich being more easily induced to commit\n\t\t\t\t\tthem because they were only liable to banishment, without the forfeiture of\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir property, he stripped murderers, as Cicero observes, of their whole\n\t\t\t\t\testates, and other offenders of one half. \n\t\t\t",
        "42":"\n\t\t\t\t He was extremely assiduous and strict in the administration of justice. He\n\t\t\t\t\texpelled from the senate such members as were convicted of bribery; and he\n\t\t\t\t\tdissolved the marriage of a man of praetorian rank, who had married a lady two\n\t\t\t\t\tdays after her divorce from a former husband, although there was no suspicion\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they had been guilty of any illicit connection. He imposed duties on the\n\t\t\t\t\timportation of foreign goods. The use of litters for travelling, purple robes,\n\t\t\t\t\tand jewels, he permitted only to persons of a certain age and station, and on\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular days. He enforced a rigid execution of the sumptuary laws; placing\n\t\t\t\t\tofficers about the markets, to seize upon all meats exposed to sale contrary to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rules, and bring them to him; sometimes sending his lictors and soldiers to\n\t\t\t\t\tcarry away such victuals as had escaped the notice of the officers, even when\n\t\t\t\t\tthey were upon the table. \n\t\t\t",
        "43":"\n\t\t\t\t His thoughts were now fully employed from day to day on a variety of great\n\t\t\t\t\tprojects for the embellishment and improvement of the city, as well as for\n\t\t\t\t\tguarding and extending the bounds of the empire. In the first place, he\n\t\t\t\t\tmeditated the construction of a temple to Mars, which should exceed in grandeur\n\t\t\t\t\tevery thing of that kind in the world. For this purpose, he intended to fill up\n\t\t\t\t\tthe lake on which he had entertained the people with the spectacle of a\n\t\t\t\t\tsea-fight. He also projected a most spacious theatre adjacent to the Tarpeian\n\t\t\t\t\tmount; and also proposed to reduce the civil law to a reasonable compass, and\n\t\t\t\t\tout of that immense and undigested mass of statutes to extract the best and most\n\t\t\t\t\tnecessary parts into a few books; to make as large a collection as possible of\n\t\t\t\t\tworks in the Greek and Latin languages, for the public use; the province of\n\t\t\t\t\tproviding and putting them in proper order being assigned to Marcus Varro. He\n\t\t\t\t\tintended likewise to drain the Pomptine marshes, to cut a channel for the\n\t\t\t\t\tdischarge of the waters of the lake Fucinus , to form a road from the Upper Sea through the ridge of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Appenine to the Tiber ; to make a\n\t\t\t\t\tcut through the isthmus of Corinth ,\n\t\t\t\t\tto reduce the Dacians, who had over-run Pontus and Thrace ,\n\t\t\t\t\twithin their proper limits, and then to make war upon the Parthians, through the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Lesser Armenia , but not to risk a\n\t\t\t\t\tgeneral engagement with them, until he had made some trial of their prowess in\n\t\t\t\t\twar. But in the midst of all his undertakings and projects, he was carried off\n\t\t\t\t\tby death; before I speak of which, it may not be improper to give an account of\n\t\t\t\t\this person, dress, and manners, together with what relates to his pursuits, both\n\t\t\t\t\tcivil and military. \n\t\t\t",
        "44":"\n\t\t\t\t It is said that he was tall, of a fair complexion, round limbed, rather full\n\t\t\t\t\tfaced, with eyes black and piercing; and that he enjoyed excellent health,\n\t\t\t\t\texcept towards the close of his life, when he was subject to sudden\n\t\t\t\t\tfainting-fits, and disturbance in his sleep. He was likewise twice seized with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe falling sickness while engaged in active service. He was so nice in the care\n\t\t\t\t\tof his person, that he not only kept the hair of his head closely cut and had\n\t\t\t\t\this face smoothly shaved, but even caused the hair on other parts of the body to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe plucked out by the roots, a practice for which some persons rallied him. His\n\t\t\t\t\tbaldness gave him much uneasiness, having often found himself on that account\n\t\t\t\t\texposed to the jibes of his enemies. He therefore used to bring forward the hair\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the crown of his head; and of all the honours conferred upon him by the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenate and people, there was none which he either accepted or used with greater\n\t\t\t\t\tpleasure, than the right of wearing constantly a laurel crown. It is said that\n\t\t\t\t\the was particular in his dress. For he used the Latus Clavus with fringes about the wrists, and always had it girded\n\t\t\t\t\tabout him, but rather loosely. This circumstance gave origin to the expression\n\t\t\t\t\tof Sylla, who often advised the nobles to beware of \"the ill-girt boy.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "45":"\n\t\t\t\t He first inhabited a small house in the Suburra, but after his\n\t\t\t\t\tadvancement to the pontificate, he occupied a palace belonging to the state in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Via Sacra. Many writers say that he liked his residence to be elegant, and\n\t\t\t\t\this entertainments sumptuous; and that he entirely took down a villa near the\n\t\t\t\t\tgrove of Aricia , Which he had built\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the foundation and finished at a vast expense, because it did not exactly\n\t\t\t\t\tsuit his taste, although he had at that time but slender means, and was in debt;\n\t\t\t\t\tand that he carried about in his expeditions tesselated and marble slabs for the\n\t\t\t\t\tfloor of his tent. \n\t\t\t",
        "46":"\n\t\t\t\t They likewise report that he invaded Britain in hopes of finding pearls, the size of which he would compare together, and\n\t\t\t\t\tascertain the weight by poising them in his hand; that he would purchase, at any\n\t\t\t\t\tcost, gems, carved works, statues, and pictures, executed by the eminent masters\n\t\t\t\t\tof antiquity; and that he would give for young and handy slaves a price so\n\t\t\t\t\textravagant, that he forbad its being entered in the diary of his expenses. \n\t\t\t",
        "47":"\n\t\t\t\t We are also told, that in the provinces he constantly maintained two tables, one\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the officers of the army, and the gentry of the country, and the other for\n\t\t\t\t\tRomans of the highest rank, and provincials of the highest distinction., He was\n\t\t\t\t\tso very exact in the management of his domestic affairs, both little and great,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he once threw a baker into prison, for serving him with a finer sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tbread than his guests; and put to death a freed-man, who was a particular\n\t\t\t\t\tfavourite, for debauching the lady of a Roman knight, although no complaint had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen made to him of the affair. \n\t\t\t",

        "49":"\n\t\t\t\t It is admitted by all that he was much addicted to women, as well as very\n\t\t\t\t\texpensive in his intrigues with them, and that he debauched many ladies of the\n\t\t\t\t\thighest quality; among whom were Posthumia, the wife of Servius Sulpicius;\n\t\t\t\t\tLollia, the wife of Aulus Gabinius; Tertulla, the wife of Marcus Crassus; and\n\t\t\t\t\tMucia, the wife of Cneius Pompey. For it is certain that the Curios, both father\n\t\t\t\t\tand son, and many others, made it a reproach to Pompey, \"That to gratify his\n\t\t\t\t\tambition, he married the daughter of a man, upon whose account he had divorced\n\t\t\t\t\this wife, after having had three children by her; and whom he used, with a deep\n\t\t\t\t\tsigh, to call AEgisthus.\" But the mistress he most loved, was Servilia,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe mother of Marcus Brutus. for whom he purchased. in his first consulship\n\t\t\t\t\tafter the commencement of their intrigue, a pearl which cost him six millions of\n\t\t\t\t\tsesterces; and in the civil war, besides other presents, assigned to her, for a\n\t\t\t\t\ttrifling consideration, some valuable farms when they were exposed to public\n\t\t\t\t\tauction. Many persons expressing their surprise at the lowness of the price,\n\t\t\t\t\tCicero wittily remarked, \"To let you know the real value of the purchase,\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween ourselves, Tertia was deducted:\" for Servilia was supposed to have\n\t\t\t\t\tprostituted her daughter Tertia to Caesar. \n\t\t\t",
        "50":"\n\t\t\t\t That he had intrigues likewise with married women in the provinces, appears from\n\t\t\t\t\tthis distich, which was as much repeated in the Gallic triumph as the former:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Watch well your wives, ye cits, we bring a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblade, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t A bald-pate master of the wenching trade. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Thy gold was spent on many a Gallic w---e; \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Exhausted now, thou com'st to borrow more. \n\t\t\t",
        "51":"\n\t\t\t\t In the number of his mistresses were also some queens; such as Eunoe, a Moor, the\n\t\t\t\t\twife of Bogudes, to whom and her husband he made, as Naso reports, many large\n\t\t\t\t\tpresents. But his greatest favourite was Cleopatra, with whom he often revelled\n\t\t\t\t\tall night until the dawn of day, and would have gone with her through Egypt in dalliance, as far as Ethiopia , in her luxurious yacht, had not the\n\t\t\t\t\tarmy refused to follow him. He afterwards invited her to Rome , whence he sent her back loaded with\n\t\t\t\t\thonours and presents, and gave her permission to call by his name a son, who,\n\t\t\t\t\taccording to the testimony of some Greek historians, resembled Caesar both in\n\t\t\t\t\tperson and gait. Mark Antony declared in the senate, that Caesar had\n\t\t\t\t\tacknowledged the child as his own; and that Caius Matias, Caius Oppius, and the\n\t\t\t\t\trest of Caesar's friends knew it to be true. On which occasion Oppius, as if it\n\t\t\t\t\thad been an imputation which he was called upon to refute, published a book to\n\t\t\t\t\tshew, \"that the child which Cleopatra fathered upon Caesar, was not his.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tHelvius Cinna, tribune to the people, admitted to several persons the fact, that\n\t\t\t\t\the had a bill ready drawn, which Caesar had ordered him to get enacted in his\n\t\t\t\t\tabsence, allowing him, with the hope of leaving issue, to take any wife he\n\t\t\t\t\tchose, and as many of them as he pleased; and to leave no room for doubt of his\n\t\t\t\t\tinfamous character for unnatural lewdness and adultery, Curio, the father, says,\n\t\t\t\t\tin one of his speeches, \" He was every woman's man.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "52":"\n\t\t\t\t It is acknowledged even by his enemies, that in regard to wine he was abstemious.\n\t\t\t\t\tA remark is ascribed to Marcus Cato, \"that Caesar was the only sober man amongst\n\t\t\t\t\tall those who were engaged in the design to subvert the government.\" In the\n\t\t\t\t\tmatter of diet, Caius Oppius informs us, \"that he was so indifferent, that when\n\t\t\t\t\ta person in whose house he was entertained, had served him with stale, instead\n\t\t\t\t\tof fresh, oil, and the rest of the company would\n\t\t\t\t\tnot touch it, he alone ate very heartily of it, that he might not seem to tax\n\t\t\t\t\tthe master of the house with rusticity or want of attention.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "53":"\n\t\t\t\t But his abstinence did not extend to pecuniary advantages, either in his military\n\t\t\t\t\tcommands, or civil offices; for we have the testimony of some writers, that he\n\t\t\t\t\ttook money from the proconsul, who was his predecessor in Spain , and from the Roman allies in that\n\t\t\t\t\tquarter, for the discharge of his debts; and plundered at the point of the sword\n\t\t\t\t\tsome towns of the Lusitanians, notwithstanding they attempted no resistance, and\n\t\t\t\t\topened their gates to him upon his arrival before them. In Gaul , he rifled the chapels and temples of the\n\t\t\t\t\tgods, which were filled with rich offerings, and demolished cities oftener for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sake of their spoil, than for any ill they had done. By this means gold\n\t\t\t\t\tbecame so plentiful with him, that he exchanged it through Italy and the provinces of the empire for\n\t\t\t\t\tthree thousand sesterces the pound. In his first consulship he purloined from\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Capitol three thousand pounds weight of gold, and substituted for it the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame quantity of gilt brass. He bartered likewise to foreign nations and\n\t\t\t\t\tprinces, for gold, the titles of allies and kings; and squeezed out of Ptolemy\n\t\t\t\t\talone near six thousand talents, in the name of himself and Pompey. He\n\t\t\t\t\tafterwards supported the expense of the civil wars, and of his triumphs and\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic spectacles, by the most flagrant rapine and sacrilege. \n\t\t\t",
        "54":"\n\t\t\t\t In eloquence and warlike achievements, he equalled at least, if he did not\n\t\t\t\t\tsurpass, the greatest of men. After his prosecution of Dolabella, he was\n\t\t\t\t\tindisputably reckoned one of the most distinguished advocates. Cicero, in\n\t\t\t\t\trecounting to Brutus the famous orators, declares, \"that he does not see that\n\t\t\t\t\tCaesar was inferior to any one of them;\" and says, \"that he had an elegant,\n\t\t\t\t\tsplendid, noble, and magnificent vein of eloquence.\" And in a letter to\n\t\t\t\t\tCornelius Nepos, he writes of him in the following terms: \"What! Of all the\n\t\t\t\t\torators, who, during the whole course of their lives, have done nothing else,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich can you prefer to him ? Which of them is more pointed or terse in his\n\t\t\t\t\tperiods, or employs more polished and elegant language ?\" In his youth, he seems\n\t\t\t\t\tto have chosen Strabo Caesar for his model; from whose oration in behalf of the\n\t\t\t\t\tSardinians he has transcribed some passages literally into his Divination. In\n\t\t\t\t\this delivery he is said to have had a shrill voice, and his action was animated,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut not ungraceful. He has left behind him some speeches, among which are ranked\n\t\t\t\t\ta few that are not genuine, such as that on behalf of Quintus Metellus. These\n\t\t\t\t\tAugustus supposes, with reason, to be rather the production of blundering\n\t\t\t\t\tshort-hand writers, who were not able to keep pace with him in the delivery,\n\t\t\t\t\tthan publications of his own. For I find in some copies that the title is not\n\t\t\t\t\t\"For Metellus,\" but \"What he wrote to Metellus:\" whereas the speech is delivered\n\t\t\t\t\tin the name of Caesar, vindicating Metellus and himself from the aspersions cast\n\t\t\t\t\tupon them by their common defamers. The speech addressed \"To his soldiers in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Spain ,\" Augustus considers likewise\n\t\t\t\t\tas spurious. We meet with two under this title; one made, as is pretended, in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe first battle, and the other in the last; at which time, Asinius Pollio says,\n\t\t\t\t\the had not leisure to address the soldiers, on account of the suddenness of the\n\t\t\t\t\tenemy's attack. \n\t\t\t",
        "55":"\n\t\t\t\t He has likewise left Commentaries of his own actions both in the war in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Gaul , and in the civil war with\n\t\t\t\t\tPompey; for the author of the Alexandrian, African, and Spanish wars is not\n\t\t\t\t\tknown with any certainty. Some think they are the productions of Oppius, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of Hirtius; the latter of whom composed the last book, which is imperfect,\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Gallic war. Of Caesar's Commentaries, Cicero, in his Brutus, speaks thus:\n\t\t\t\t\t\" He wrote his Commentaries in a manner deserving of great approbation: they are\n\t\t\t\t\tplain, precise, and elegant, without any affectation of rhetorical ornament. In\n\t\t\t\t\thaving thus prepared materials for others who might be inclined to write his\n\t\t\t\t\thistory, he may perhaps have encouraged some silly creatures to enter upon such\n\t\t\t\t\ta work, who will needs be dressing up his actions in all the extravagance of\n\t\t\t\t\tbombast; but he has discouraged wise men from ever attempting the subject.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tHirtius delivers his opinion of these Commentaries in the following terms: \"So\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat is the approbation with which they are universally perused, that, instead\n\t\t\t\t\tof rousing, he seems to have precluded, the efforts of any future historian.\n\t\t\t\t\tYet, with respect to this work, we have more reason to admire him than others;\n\t\t\t\t\tfor they only know how well and correctly he has written, but we know, likewise,\n\t\t\t\t\thow easily and quickly he did it.\" \n\t\t\t\t Pollio Asinius thinks that they were not drawn up with much care, or with a due\n\t\t\t\t\tregard to truth; for he insinuates that Caesar was too hasty of belief in regard\n\t\t\t\t\tto what was performed by others under his orders; and that, he has not given a\n\t\t\t\t\tvery faithful account of his own acts, either by design, or through defect of\n\t\t\t\t\tmemory; expressing at the same time an opinion that Caesar intended a new and\n\t\t\t\t\tmore correct edition. He has left behind him likewise two books on Analogy, with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe same number under the title of Anti-Cato, and a poem entitled The\n\t\t\t\t\t.Itinerary. Of these books, he composed the first two in his passage over the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Alps , as he was returning to the\n\t\t\t\t\tarmy after making his circuit in Hither-Gaul; the second work about the time of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe battle of Munda ; and the last\n\t\t\t\t\tduring the four-and-twenty days he employed in his journey from Rome to Farther-Spain. There are extant some\n\t\t\t\t\tletters of his to the senate, written in a manner never practised by any before\n\t\t\t\t\thim; for they are distinguished into pages in the form of a memorandum book:\n\t\t\t\t\twhereas the consuls and commanders till then, used constantly in their letters\n\t\t\t\t\tto continue the line quite across the sheet, without any folding or distinction\n\t\t\t\t\tof pages. There are extant likewise some letters from him to Cicero , and others to his friends, concerning\n\t\t\t\t\this domestic affairs; in which, if there was occasion for secrecy, he wrote in\n\t\t\t\t\tcyphers; that is, he used the alphabet in such a manner, that not a single word\n\t\t\t\t\tcould be made out. The way to decipher those epistles was to substitute the\n\t\t\t\t\tfourth for the first letter, as d for a, and so for the other letters\n\t\t\t\t\trespectively. Some things likewise pass under his name, said to have been\n\t\t\t\t\twritten by him when a boy, or a very young man; as the Encomium of Hercules , a tragedy entitled (Edipus, and a\n\t\t\t\t\tcollection of Apophthegms; all which Augustus forbad to be published, in a short\n\t\t\t\t\tand plain letter to Pompeius Macer, who was employed by him in the arrangement\n\t\t\t\t\tof his libraries. \n\t\t\t",
        "56":"\n\t\t\t\t He was perfect in the use of arms, an accomplished rider, and able to endure\n\t\t\t\t\tfatigue beyond all belief. On a march he used to go at the head of his troops,\n\t\t\t\t\tsometimes on horseback, but oftener on foot, with his head bare in all kinds of\n\t\t\t\t\tweather. He would travel post in a light carriage without baggage, at the rate of a hundred miles a day; and if he was\n\t\t\t\t\tstopped by floods in the rivers, he swam across, or floated on skins inflated\n\t\t\t\t\twith wind, so that he often anticipated intelligence of his movements. \n\t\t\t",
        "57":"\n\t\t\t\t In his expeditions, it is difficult to say whether his caution or his daring was\n\t\t\t\t\tmost conspicuous. He never marched his army by roads which were exposed to\n\t\t\t\t\tambuscades, without having previously examined the nature of the ground by his\n\t\t\t\t\tscouts. Nor did he cross over to Britain , before he had carefully examined, in person, the navigation, the harbours,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the most convenient point of landing in the island. When intelligence was\n\t\t\t\t\tbrought to him of the siege of his camp in Germany , he made his way to his troops, through the enemy's\n\t\t\t\t\tstations, in a Gaulish dress. He crossed the sea from Brundisium and Dyrrachium , in the winter, through the midst of the enemy's\n\t\t\t\t\tfleets; and the troops, under orders to join him, being slow in their movements,\n\t\t\t\t\tnotwithstand, ing repeated messages to hurry them, but to no purpose, he at last\n\t\t\t\t\twent privately, and alone, aboard a small vessel in the night time, with his\n\t\t\t\t\thead muffled up; nor did he make himself known, or suffer the master to put\n\t\t\t\t\tabout, although the wind blew strong against them, until they were ready to\n\t\t\t\t\tsink. \n\t\t\t",
        "58":"\n\t\t\t\t He was never deterred from any enterprise, nor retarded in the prosecution of it,\n\t\t\t\t\tby superstition. When a\n\t\t\t\t\tvictim, which he was about to offer in sacrifice, made its escape, he did not\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore defer his expedition against Scipio and Juba . And happening to fall, upon stepping out of the ship, he\n\t\t\t\t\tgave a lucky turn to the omen, by exclaiming, \"I hold thee fast, Africa .\" To chide the prophecies which were\n\t\t\t\t\tspread abroad, that the name of the Scipios was, by the decrees of fate,\n\t\t\t\t\tfortunate and invincible in that province, he retained in the camp a profligate\n\t\t\t\t\twretch, of the family of the Cornelii, who, on account of his scandalous life,\n\t\t\t\t\twas surnamed Salutio. \n\t\t\t",
        "59":"\n\t\t\t\t He not only fought pitched battles, but made sudden attacks when an opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\toffered; often at the end of a march, and sometimes during the most violent\n\t\t\t\t\tstorms, when nobody could imagine he would stir. Nor was he ever backward in\n\t\t\t\t\tfighting, until towards the end of his life. He then was of opinion, that the\n\t\t\t\t\toftener he had been crowned with success, the less he ought to expose himself to\n\t\t\t\t\tnew hazards; and that nothing he could gain by a victory would compensate for\n\t\t\t\t\twhat he might lose by a miscarriage. He never defeated the enemy without driving\n\t\t\t\t\tthem from their camp; and giving them no time.to rally their forces. When the\n\t\t\t\t\tissue of a battle was doubtful, he sent away all the horses, and his own first,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat having no means of flight, they might be under the greater necessity of\n\t\t\t\t\tstanding their ground. \n\t\t\t",

This horse\n\t\t\t\t\the had bred himself, and the soothsayers having interpreted these circumstances\n\t\t\t\t\tinto an omen that its owner would be master of the world, he brought him up with\n\t\t\t\t\tparticular care, and broke him in himself, as the horse would suffer no one else\n\t\t\t\t\tto mount him.

Sometimes, giving them orders not to lose sight of\n\t\t\t\t\thim, he would suddenly depart by day or by night, and lengthen the marches in\n\t\t\t\t\torder to tire them out, as they followed him at a distance. \n\t\t\t",

Accordingly, when his troops were in great alarm at the expected\n\t\t\t\t\tarrival of king Juba , he called them\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether, and said, \"I have to inform you that in a very few days the king will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe here, with ten legions, thirty thousand horse, a hundred thousand light-armed\n\t\t\t\t\tfoot, and three hundred elephants.

No one of them, during the\n\t\t\t\t\twhole course of the war, deserted to the enemy; and many of those who were made\n\t\t\t\t\tprisoners, though they were offered their lives, upon condition of bearing arms\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst him, refused to accept the terms. They endured want, and other\n\t\t\t\t\thardships, not only when they were besieged themselves, but when they besieged\n\t\t\t\t\tothers, to such a degree, that Pompey, when blocked up in the neighbourhood of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Dyrrachium , upon seeing a sort of\n\t\t\t\t\tbread made of an herb, which they lived upon, said, \"I have to do with wild\n\t\t\t\t\tbeasts,\" and ordered it immediately to be taken away; because, if his troops\n\t\t\t\t\tshould see it, their spirit might be broken by perceiving the endurance and\n\t\t\t\t\tdetermined resolution of the enemy. With what bravery they fought, one instance\n\t\t\t\t\taffords sufficient proof; which is, that after an unsuccessful engagement at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Dyrrachium , they called for\n\t\t\t\t\tpunishment; insomuch that their general found it more necessary to comfort than\n\t\t\t\t\tto punish them. In other battles, in different quarters, they defeated with ease\n\t\t\t\t\timmense armies of the enemy, although they were much inferior to them in number.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn short, one cohort of the sixth legion held out a fort against four legions\n\t\t\t\t\tbelonging to Pompey, during several hours; being almost every one of them\n\t\t\t\t\twounded by the vast number of arrows discharged against them, and of which there\n\t\t\t\t\twere found within the ramparts a hundred and thirty thousand.

When he had placed himself at the head of affairs,\n\t\t\t\t\the advanced some of his faithful adherents, though of mean extraction, to the\n\t\t\t\t\thighest offices; and when he was censured for this partiality, he openly said,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Had I been assisted by robbers and cut-throats in the defense of my honour, I\n\t\t\t\t\tshould have made them the same recompense.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "72":"\n\t\t\t\t The resentment he entertained against any one was never so implacable that he did\n\t\t\t\t\tnot very willingly renounce it when opportunity offered. Although Caius Memmius\n\t\t\t\t\thad published some extremely virulent speeches against him, and he had answered\n\t\t\t\t\tthem with equal acrimony, yet he afterwards assisted him with his vote and\n\t\t\t\t\tinterest, when he stood candidate for the consulship. When C. Calvus, after\n\t\t\t\t\tpublishing some scandalous epigrams upon him, endeavoured to effect a\n\t\t\t\t\treconciliation by the intercession of friends, he wrote to him, of his own\n\t\t\t\t\taccord; the first letter. And when Valerius Catullus, who had, as he himself\n\t\t\t\t\tobserved, fixed such a stain upon his character in his verses upon Mamurra as\n\t\t\t\t\tnever could be obliterated, he begged his pardon, invited him to supper the same\n\t\t\t\t\tday; and continued to take up his lodging with his father occasionally, as he\n\t\t\t\t\thad been accustomed to do. \n\t\t\t",
        "73":"\n\t\t\t\t His temper was also naturally averse to severity in retaliation. After he had\n\t\t\t\t\tcaptured the pirates, by whom he had been taken, having sworn that he would\n\t\t\t\t\tcrucify them, he did so indeed; but he first ordered their throats to be cut.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t He could never bear the thought of doing any harm to Cornelius\n\t\t\t\t\tPhagitas, who had dogged him in the night when he was sick and a fugitive, with\n\t\t\t\t\tthe design of carrying him to Sylla, and from whose hands he had escaped with\n\t\t\t\t\tsome difficulty by giving him a bribe. Philemon, his amanuensis, who had\n\t\t\t\t\tpromised his enemies to poison him, he put to death without torture. When he was\n\t\t\t\t\tsummoned as a witness against Publicus Clodius, his wife Pompeia's gallant, who\n\t\t\t\t\twas prosecuted for profanation of religious ceremonies, he declared he knew\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing of the affair, although his mother Aurelia, and his sister Julia, gave\n\t\t\t\t\tthe court an exact and full account of the circumstances. And being asked why\n\t\t\t\t\tthen he had divorced his wife? \"Because,\" he said, \"my family should not only be\n\t\t\t\t\tfree from guilt, but even from the suspicion of it.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "74":"\n\t\t\t\t Both in his administration and his conduct towards the vanquished party in the\n\t\t\t\t\tcivil war, he showed a wonderful moderation and clemency. For while Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\tdeclared that he would consider those as enemies who did not take arms in\n\t\t\t\t\tdefence of the republic, he desired it to be understood, that he should regard\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who remained neuter as his friends. With regard to all those to whom he\n\t\t\t\t\thad, on Pompey's recommendation, given any command in the army, he left them at\n\t\t\t\t\tperfect liberty to go over to him, if they pleased. When some proposals were\n\t\t\t\t\tmade at Ilerda \n\t\t\t\t\t for a\n\t\t\t\t\tsurrender, which gave rise to a free communication between the two camps, and\n\t\t\t\t\tAfranius and Petreius, upon a sudden change of resolu* tion, had put to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsword all Caesar's men who were found in the camp, he scorned to imitate the\n\t\t\t\t\tbase treachery which they had practised against himself. On the field of\n\t\t\t\t\tPharsalia, he called out to the soldiers \" to spare their fellow-citizens,\" and\n\t\t\t\t\tafterwards gave permission to every man in his army to save an enemy. None of\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, so far as appears, lost their lives but in battle, excepting only\n\t\t\t\t\tAfranius, Faustus, and young Lucius Caesar; and it is thought that even they\n\t\t\t\t\twere put to death without his consent. Afranius and Faustus had borne arms\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst him, after obtaining their pardon; and Lucius Caesar had not only in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmost cruel manner destroyed with fire and sword his freedmen and slaves, but cut\n\t\t\t\t\tto pieces the wild beasts which he had prepared for the entertainment of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople. And finally, a little before his death, he permitted all whom he had not\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore pardoned, to return into Italy ,\n\t\t\t\t\tand to bear offices both civil and military. He even replaced the statues of\n\t\t\t\t\tSylla and Pompey, which had been thrown down by the populace. And after this,\n\t\t\t\t\twhatever was devised or uttered, he chose rather to check than to punish it.\n\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, having detected certain conspiracies and nocturnal assemblies, he\n\t\t\t\t\twent no farther than to intimate by a proclamation that he knew of them; and as\n\t\t\t\t\tto those who indulged themselves in the liberty of reflecting severely upon him,\n\t\t\t\t\the only warned them in a public speech not to persist in their offence. He bore\n\t\t\t\t\twith great moderation a virulent libel written against him by Aulus Caecinna,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the abusive lampoons of Pitholaiis, most highly reflecting on his\n\t\t\t\t\treputation. \n\t\t\t",
        "75":"\n\t\t\t\t His other words and actions, however, so far outweigh all his good qualities,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it is thought he abused his power, and was justly cut off. For he not only\n\t\t\t\t\tobtained excessive honours, such as the consulship every year, the dictatorship\n\t\t\t\t\tfor life, and the censorship, but also the title of emperor, and the surname of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t besides having his statue amongst the kings, and a lofty couch in the theatre. He\n\t\t\t\t\teven suffered some honours to be decreed to him, which were unbefitting the most\n\t\t\t\t\texalted of mankind: such as a gilded chair of state in the senate-house and on\n\t\t\t\t\this tribunal, a consecrated chariot, and banners in the Circensian procession,\n\t\t\t\t\ttemples, altars, statues among the gods, a bed of state in the temples, a\n\t\t\t\t\tpriest, and a college of priests dedicated to himself, like those of Pan; and\n\t\t\t\t\tthat one of the months should be called by his name. There were, indeed, no\n\t\t\t\t\thonours which he did not either assume himself, or grant to others, at his will\n\t\t\t\t\tand pleasure. In his third and fourth consulship, he used only the title of the\n\t\t\t\t\toffice, being content with the power of dictator, which was conferred upon him\n\t\t\t\t\twith the consulship; and in both years he substituted other consuls in his room,\n\t\t\t\t\tduring the three last months; so that in the intervals he held no assemblies of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people, for the election of magistrates, excepting only tribunes and ediles\n\t\t\t\t\tof the people; and appointed officers, under the name of praefects, instead of\n\t\t\t\t\tpraetors, to administer the affairs of the city during his absence. The office\n\t\t\t\t\tof consul having become vacant, by the sudden death of one of the consuls the\n\t\t\t\t\tday before the calends of January [the 1st Jan.], he conferred it on a person\n\t\t\t\t\twho requested it of him, for a few hours. Assuming the same licence, and\n\t\t\t\t\tregardless of the customs of his country, he appointed magistrates to hold their\n\t\t\t\t\toffices for terms of years. He granted the insignia of the consular dignity to\n\t\t\t\t\tten persons of praetorian rank. He admitted into the senate some men who had\n\t\t\t\t\tmade free of the city, and even natives of Gaul, who were semi-barbarians. He\n\t\t\t\t\tlikewise appointed to the management of the mint, and the public revenue of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate, some servants of his own household; and entrusted the command of three\n\t\t\t\t\tlegions, which he left at Alexandria , to an old catamite of his, the son of his freed-man\n\t\t\t\t\tRufinus. \n\t\t\t",
        "76":"\n\t\t\t\t He was guilty of the same extravagance in the language he publicly used, as Titus\n\t\t\t\t\tAmpius informs us; according to whom he said, \"The republic is nothing but a\n\t\t\t\t\tname, without substance or reality. Sylla was an ignorant fellow to abdicate the\n\t\t\t\t\tdictatorship. Men ought to consider what is becoming when they talk with me, and\n\t\t\t\t\tlook upon what I say as a law.\" To such a pitch of arrogance did he proceed,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat when a soothsayer announced to him the unfavourable omen, that the entrails\n\t\t\t\t\tof a victim offered for sacrifice were without a heart, he said, \"The entrails\n\t\t\t\t\twill be more favourable when I please; and it ought not to be regarded as a\n\t\t\t\t\tprodigy that a beast should be found wanting a heart.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "77":"\n\t\t\t\t But what brought upon him the greatest odium, and was thought an unpardonable\n\t\t\t\t\tinsult, was his receiving the whole body of the conscript fathers sitting,\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore the temple of Venus Genitrix, when they waited upon him with a number of\n\t\t\t\t\tdecrees, conferring on him the highest dignities. Some say that, on his\n\t\t\t\t\tattempting to rise, he was held down by Cornelius Balbus; others, that he did\n\t\t\t\t\tnot attempt to rise at all, but frowned on Caius Trebatius, who suggested to him\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he should stand up to receive the senate. This behaviour appeared the more\n\t\t\t\t\tintolerable in him, because, when one of the tribunes of the people, Pontius\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Aquila , would not rise up to him,\n\t\t\t\t\tas he passed by the tribunes' seat during his triumph, he was so much offended,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he cried out, \"Well then, you tribune, Aquila, oust me from the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment.\" And for some days afterwards, he never promised a favour to any\n\t\t\t\t\tperson, without this proviso, \"if Pontus Aquila will give me leave.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "78":"\n\t\t\t\t To this extraordinary mark of contempt for the senate, he added another affront\n\t\t\t\t\tstill more outrageous. For when, after the sacred rites of the Latin festival,\n\t\t\t\t\the was returning home, amidst the immoderate and unusual acclamations of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople, a man in the crowd put a laurel crown, encircled with a white\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfillet, on one of his statues; upon which, the tribunes of the people, Epidius\n\t\t\t\t\tMarullus, and Caesetius Flavus ordered the fillet to be removed from the crown,\n\t\t\t\t\tand the man to be taken to prison. Caesar, being much concerned either that the\n\t\t\t\t\tidea of royalty had been suggested to so little purpose, or, as was said, that\n\t\t\t\t\the was thus deprived of the merit of refusing it, reprimanded the tribunes very\n\t\t\t\t\tseverely, and dismissed them from their office. From that day forward, he was\n\t\t\t\t\tnever able to wipe off the scandal of affecting the name of king, although he\n\t\t\t\t\treplied to the populace when they saluted him by that title, \"I am Caesar, and\n\t\t\t\t\tno king.\" And at the feast of the Lupercalia, when the consul Antony\n\t\t\t\t\tplaced a crown upon his head in the rostra several times, he as often put it\n\t\t\t\t\taway, and sent it to the Capitol for Jupiter , the Best and the Greatest. A report was very current,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he had a design of withdrawing to Alexandria or Ilium ,\n\t\t\t\t\twhither he proposed to transfer the imperial power, to drain Italy by new levies, and to leave the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment of the city to be administered by his friends. To this report 'it was\n\t\t\t\t\tadded, that in the next meeting of the senate, Lucius Cotta, one of the fifteen,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t would make a motion, that as there was in the Sibylline books\n\t\t\t\t\ta prophecy, that the Parthians would never be subdued but by a king, Caesar\n\t\t\t\t\tshould have that title conferred upon him. \n\t\t\t",
        "79":"\n\t\t\t\t For this reason the conspirators precipitated the execution of their design, that they might not be obliged to give\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir assent to the proposal. Instead, therefore, of caballing any longer\n\t\t\t\t\tseparately, in small parties, they now united their counsels; the people\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves being dissatisfied with the present state of affairs, both privately\n\t\t\t\t\tand publicly condemning the tyranny under which they lived, and calling on\n\t\t\t\t\tpatriots to assert their cause against the usurper. Upon the admission of\n\t\t\t\t\tforeigners into the senate, a hand-bill was posted up in these words: \"A good\n\t\t\t\t\tdeed! let no one shew a new senator the way to the house.\" These verses were\n\t\t\t\t\tlikewise currently repeated: The Gauls he dragged in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttriumph through the town, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Caesar has brought into the senate-house, And changed their plaids for the patrician\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgown. \n\t\t\t\t\t Gallos Caesar in triumphum ducit: iidem in curiam \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Galli braccas deposuerunt, latum clavum sumpserunt. When\n\t\t\t\t\tQuintus Maximus, who had been his deputy in the consulship for the last three\n\t\t\t\t\tmonths, entered the theatre, and the lictor, according to custom, bid the people\n\t\t\t\t\ttake notice who was coming, they all cried out, \"He is no consul.\" After the\n\t\t\t\t\tremoval of Cesetius and Marullus from their office, they were found to have a\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat many votes at the next election of consuls. Some one wrote under the\n\t\t\t\t\tstatue of Lucius Brutus \"Would you were now alive !\" and under the statue of\n\t\t\t\t\tCaesar himself these lines: Because he drove from\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Rome the royal race, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Brutus was first made consul in their place. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t This man, because he put the consuls down, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Has been rewarded with a royal crown. \n\t\t\t\t\t Brutus, quia reges ejecit, consul primus factus est: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Hic, quia consules ejecit, rex postremo factus est. About\n\t\t\t\t\tsixty persons were engaged in the conspiracy against him, of whom Caius Cassius,\n\t\t\t\t\tand Marcus and Decimus Brutus were the chief. It was at first debated amongst\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, whether they should attack him in the Campus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMartius when he was taking the votes of the tribes, or some bf\n\t\t\t\t\tthem should throw him off the bridge. whilst others should be ready to stab him\n\t\t\t\t\tupon his fall; or else in the Via Sacra, or at the entrance of the theatre. But\n\t\t\t\t\tafter public notice had been given by proclamation for the senate to assemble\n\t\t\t\t\tupon the ides of March [15th March], in the senate-house built by Pompey, they\n\t\t\t\t\tapproved both of the time and place, as most fitting for their purpose. \n\t\t\t",
        "80":"\n\t\t\t\t Casar had warning given him of his fate by indubitable omens. A few months\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore, when the colonists settled at Capua , by virtue of the Julian law, were demolishing some old\n\t\t\t\t\tsepulchres, in building countryhouses, and were the more eager at the work,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause they discovered certain vessels of antique workmanship, a tablet of\n\t\t\t\t\tbrass was found in a tomb, in which Capys, the founder of Capua , was said to have been buried, with an\n\t\t\t\t\tinscription in the Greek language to this effect: \"Whenever the bones of Capys\n\t\t\t\t\tcome to be discovered, a descendant of Iulus will be slain by the hands of his\n\t\t\t\t\tkinsmen, and his death revenged by fearful disasters throughout Italy .\" Lest any person should regard this\n\t\t\t\t\tanecdote as a fabulous or silly invention, it was circulated upon the authority\n\t\t\t\t\tof Caius Balbus, an intimate friend of Caesar's. A few days likewise before his\n\t\t\t\t\tdeath, he was informed that the horses, which, upon his crossing the Rubicon, he\n\t\t\t\t\thad consecrated, and turned loose to graze without a keeper, abstained entirely\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom eating, and shed floods of tears. The soothsayer Spurinna, observing\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain ominous appearances in a sacrifice which he was offering, advised him to\n\t\t\t\t\tbeware of some danger, which threatened to befall him before the ides of March\n\t\t\t\t\twere past. The day before the ides, birds of various kinds from a neighbouring\n\t\t\t\t\tgrove, pursuing a wren which flew into Pompey's senate-house, \n\t\t\t\t\twith a sprig of laurel in its beak, tore it in pieces. Also, in the night on\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the day of his murder dawned, he dreamt at one time that he was soaring\n\t\t\t\t\tabove the clouds, and, at another, that he had joined hands with Jupiter . His wife Calpurnia fancied in her\n\t\t\t\t\tsleep that the pediment of the house was falling down, and her husband stabbed\n\t\t\t\t\ton her bosom; immediately upon which the chamber doors flew open. On account of\n\t\t\t\t\tthese omens, as well as his infirm health, he was in some doubt whether he\n\t\t\t\t\tshould not remain at home, and defer to some other opportunity the business\n\t\t\t\t\twhich he intended to propose to the senate; but Decimus Brutus advising him not\n\t\t\t\t\tto disappoint the senators, who were numerously assembled, and waited his\n\t\t\t\t\tcoming, he was prevailed upon to go, and accordingly set forward about the fifth\n\t\t\t\t\thour. In his way, some person having thrust into his hand a paper, warning him\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst the plot, he mixed it with some other documents which he held in his\n\t\t\t\t\tleft hand, intending to read it at leisure. Victim after victim was slain,\n\t\t\t\t\twithout any favourable appearances in the entrails; but still, disregarding all\n\t\t\t\t\tomens, he entered the senate-house, laughing at Spurinna as a false prophet,\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the ides of March were come without any mischief having befallen him. To\n\t\t\t\t\twhich the soothsayer replied, \"They are come, indeed, but not past.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "81":"\n\t\t\t\t When he had taken his seat, the conspirators stood round him, under colour of\n\t\t\t\t\tpaying their compliments; and immediately Tullius Cimber, who had engaged to\n\t\t\t\t\tcommence the assault, advancing nearer than the rest, as if he had some favour\n\t\t\t\t\tto request, Casar made signs that he\n\t\t\t\t\tshould defer his petition to some other time. Tullius immediately seized him by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe toga, on both shoulders; at which Casar crying out, \"Violence is meant!\" one of the Cassii\n\t\t\t\t\twounded him a little below the throat. Caesar seized him by the arm, and ran it\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough with his style; and endeavouring to rush forward, was stopped by another wound.\n\t\t\t\t\tFinding himself now attacked on all hands with naked poniards, he wrapped the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttoga about his head, and at the same moment drew the skirt round his\n\t\t\t\t\tlegs with his left hand, that he might fall more decently with the lower part of\n\t\t\t\t\this body covered.He was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering a groan\n\t\t\t\t\tonly, but no cry, at the first wound; although some authors relate, that when\n\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Brutus fell upon him, he\n\t\t\t\t\texclaimed, \"What! art thou, too, one of them!\" Thou, my son!\" The\n\t\t\t\t\twhole assembly instantly dispersing, he lay for some time after he expired,\n\t\t\t\t\tuntil three of his slaves laid the body on a litter, and carried it home, with\n\t\t\t\t\tone arm hanging down over the side. Among so many wounds, there was none that\n\t\t\t\t\twas mortal, in the opinion of the surgeon Antistius, except the second, which he\n\t\t\t\t\treceived in the breast. The conspirators meant to drag his body into the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Tiber as soon.as they had killed\n\t\t\t\t\thim; to confiscate his estate, and rescind all his enactments; but they were\n\t\t\t\t\tdeterred by fear of Mark Antony, and Lepidus, Caesar's master of the horse, and\n\t\t\t\t\tabandoned their intentions. \n\t\t\t",
        "82":"\n\t\t\t\t At the instance of Lucius Piso, his fatherin-law, his will was opened and read in\n\t\t\t\t\tMark Antony's house. He had made it on the ides (13th) of the preceding\n\t\t\t\t\tSeptember, at his Lavica villa, and committed it to the custody of the chief of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Vestal Virgins. Quintus Tubero informs us, that in all the wills he had\n\t\t\t\t\tsigned, from the time of his first consulship to the breaking out of. the civil\n\t\t\t\t\twar, Cneius Pompey was appointed his heir, and that this had been publicly\n\t\t\t\t\tnotified to the army.

Other heirs [in\n\t\t\t\t\tremainder] were named at the close of the will, in which he also adopted Caius\n\t\t\t\t\tOctavius, who was to assume his name, into his family; and nominated most of\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who were concerned in his death among the guardians of his son, if he\n\t\t\t\t\tshould have any; as well as Decimus Brutus amongst his heirs of the second\n\t\t\t\t\torder.

        "83":"\n\t\t\t\t Notice of his funeral having been solemnly proclaimed, a pile was erected in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Campus Martius , near the tomb of\n\t\t\t\t\this daughter Julia; and before the Rostra was placed a gilded tabernacle, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tmodel of the temple of Venus Genitrix; within which was an ivory bed, covered\n\t\t\t\t\twith purple and cloth of gold. At the head was a trophy, with the\n\t\t\t\t\t[blood-stained] robe in which he was slain. It being considered that the whole\n\t\t\t\t\tday would not suffice for carrying the funeral oblations in solemn procession\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore the corpse, directions were given for every one, without regard to order,\n\t\t\t\t\tto carry them from the city into the Campus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMartius , by what way they pleased. To raise pity and indignation\n\t\t\t\t\tfor his murder, in the plays acted at the funeral, a passage was sung from\n\t\t\t\t\tPacuvius's tragedy, entitled, The Trial for Arms : That ever I, unhappy man, should save \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Wretches, who thus have brought me to the grave? \n\t\t\t\t\t And some lines also from Attilius's tragedy of \" Electra,\" to the same\n\t\t\t\t\teffect. Instead of a funeral panegyric, the consul Antony ordered a herald to\n\t\t\t\t\tproclaim to the people the decree of the senate, in which they had bestowed upon\n\t\t\t\t\thim all honours, divine and human; with the oath by which they had engaged\n\t\t\t\t\tthemselves for the defence of his person; and to these he added only a few words\n\t\t\t\t\tof his own. The magistrates and others who had formerly filled the highest\n\t\t\t\t\toffices, carried the bier from the Rostra into the Forum. While some proposed\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the body should be burnt in the sanctuary of the temple of Jupiter\n\t\t\t\t\tCapitolinus, and others in Pompey's senate-house; on a sudden, two men, with\n\t\t\t\t\tswords by their sides, and spears in their hands, set fire to the bier with\n\t\t\t\t\tlighted torches. The throng around immediately heaped upon it dry faggots, the\n\t\t\t\t\ttribunals and benches of the adjoining courts, and whatever else came to hand.\n\t\t\t\t\tThen the musicians and players stripped off the dresses they wore on the present\n\t\t\t\t\toccasion, taken from the wardrobe of his triumph at spectacles, rent them, and\n\t\t\t\t\tthrew them into the flames. The legionaries, also, of his veteran bands, cast in\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir armour, which they had put on in honour of his funeral. Most of the ladies\n\t\t\t\t\tdid the same by their ornaments, with the bullae , and\n\t\t\t\t\tmantles of their children. In this public mourning there joined a multitude of\n\t\t\t\t\tforeigners, expressing their sorrow according to the fashion of their respective\n\t\t\t\t\tcountries; but especially the Jews, who for several nights together frequented the spot where the body was\n\t\t\t\t\tburnt. \n\t\t\t",
        "84":"\n\t\t\t\t The populace ran from the funeral, with torches in their hands, to the houses of\n\t\t\t\t\tBrutus and Cassius, and were repelled with difficulty. Going in quest of\n\t\t\t\t\tCornelius Cinna, who had in a speech, the day before, reflected severely upon\n\t\t\t\t\tCaesar, and mistaking for him Helvius Cinna, who happened to fall into their\n\t\t\t\t\thands, they murdered the latter, and carried his head about the city on the\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint of a spear. They afterwards erected in the Forum a column of Numidian\n\t\t\t\t\tmarble, formed of one stone nearly twenty feet high, and inscribed upon it these\n\t\t\t\t\twords, TO THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY. At this column they continued for a long\n\t\t\t\t\ttime to offer sacrifices, make vows, and decide controversies, in which they\n\t\t\t\t\tswore by Caesar. \n\t\t\t",
        "85":"\n\t\t\t\t Some of Caesar's friends entertained a suspicion, that he neither desired nor\n\t\t\t\t\tcared to live any longer, on account of his declining health; and for that\n\t\t\t\t\treason slighted all the omens of religion, and the warnings of his friends.\n\t\t\t\t\tOthers are of opinion, that thinking himself secure in the late decree of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsenate, and their oaths, he dismissed his Spanish guards who attended him with\n\t\t\t\t\tdrawn swords. Others again suppose, that he chose rather to face at once the\n\t\t\t\t\tdangers which threatened him on all sides, than to be for ever on the watch\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst them. Some tell us that he used to say, the commonwealth was more\n\t\t\t\t\tinterested in the safety of his person than himself: for that he had for some\n\t\t\t\t\ttime been satiated with power and glory; but that the commonwealth, if anything\n\t\t\t\t\tshould befall him, would have no rest, and, involved in another civil war, would\n\t\t\t\t\tbe in a worse state than before. \n\t\t\t",
        "86":"\n\t\t\t\t This, however, was generally admitted, that his death was in many respects such\n\t\t\t\t\tas he would have chosen. For, upon reading the account delivered by Xenophon,\n\t\t\t\t\thow Cyrus in his last illness gave instructions respecting his funeral, Caesar\n\t\t\t\t\tdeprecated a lingering death, and wished that his own might be sudden and\n\t\t\t\t\tspeedy. And the day before he died, the conversation at supper, in the house of\n\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Lepidus, turning upon. what was the most eligible way of dying, he gave\n\t\t\t\t\this opinion in favour of a death that is sudden and_unagx pected. \n\t\t\t",
        "87":"\n\t\t\t\t He died in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and was ranked amongst the Gods, not\n\t\t\t\t\tonly by a formal decree, but in the belief of the vulgar. For during the first\n\t\t\t\t\tgames which Augustus, his heir, consecrated to his memory, a comet blazed for\n\t\t\t\t\tseven days together, rising always about eleven o'clock; and it was supposed to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe the soul of Caesar, now received into heaven: for which reason, likewise, he\n\t\t\t\t\tis represented on his statue with a star on his brow. The senate-house in which\n\t\t\t\t\the was slain, was ordered to be shut up, and a decree made that the ides of March\n\t\t\t\t\tshould be called parricidal, and the senate should never more assemble on that\n\t\t\t\t\tday. \n\t\t\t",
        "88":"\n\t\t\t\t Scarcely any of those who were accessory to his murder, survived him more than\n\t\t\t\t\tthree years, or died a natural death. They were all condemned by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe senate: some were taken off by one accident, some by another. Part of them\n\t\t\t\t\tperished at sea, others fell in battle; and some slew themselves with the same\n\t\t\t\t\tponiard with which they had stabbed Caesar. \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t",
        "89":"\n\t\t\t\t Remarks on Julius Caesar \n\t\t\t\t The termination of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey forms a new epoch in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Roman History, at which a Republic, which had subsisted with unrivalled\n\t\t\t\t\tglory during a period of about four hundred and sixty years, relapsed into a\n\t\t\t\t\tstate of despotism, whence it never more could emerge. So sudden a transition\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom prosperity to the ruin of public freedom, without the intervention of any\n\t\t\t\t\tforeign enemy, excites a reasonable conjecture, that the constitution in which\n\t\t\t\t\tit could take place, however vigorous in appearance, must have lost that\n\t\t\t\t\tsoundness of political health which had enabled it to endure through so many\n\t\t\t\t\tages. A short view of its preceding state, and of that in which it was at the\n\t\t\t\t\ttime of the revolution now mentioned, will best ascertain the foundation of such\n\t\t\t\t\ta conjecture. \n\t\t\t\t Though the Romans, upon the expulsion of Tarquin, made an essential change in the\n\t\t\t\t\tpolitical form of the state, they did not carry their detestation of regal\n\t\t\t\t\tauthority so far as to abolish the religious institutions of Numa Pompilius, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond of their kings, according to which, the priesthood, with all the\n\t\t\t\t\tinfluence annexed to that order, was placed in the hands of the aristocracy. By\n\t\t\t\t\tthis wise policy a restraint was put upon the fickleness and violence of the\n\t\t\t\t\tpeople in matters of government, and a decided superiority given to the Senate\n\t\t\t\t\tboth in the deliberative and executive parts of administration. This advantage\n\t\t\t\t\twas afterwards indeed diminished by the creation of Tribunes of the people; a\n\t\t\t\t\tset of men whose ambition often embroiled the Republic in civil dissensions, and\n\t\t\t\t\twho at last abused their authority to such a degree, that they became\n\t\t\t\t\tinstruments of aggrandizement to any leading men in the state who could purchase\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir friendship. In general, however, the majority of the Tribunes being\n\t\t\t\t\tactuated by views which comprehended the interests of the multitude, rather than\n\t\t\t\t\tthose of individuals, they did not so much endanger the liberty, as they\n\t\t\t\t\tinterrupted the tranquillity, of the public; and when the occasional commotions\n\t\t\t\t\tsubsided, there remained no permanent ground for the establishment of personal\n\t\t\t\t\tusurpation. \n\t\t\t\t In every government, an object of the last importance to the peace and welfare of\n\t\t\t\t\tsociety is the morals of the people; and in proportion as a community is\n\t\t\t\t\tenlarged by propagation, or the accession of a multitude of new members, a more\n\t\t\t\t\tstrict attention is requisite to guard against that dissolution of manners to\n\t\t\t\t\twhich a crowded and extensive capital has a natural tendency. Of this the Romans\n\t\t\t\t\tbecame sensible in the growing state of the Republic. In the year of the City\n\t\t\t\t\t312, two magistrates were first created for taking an account of the number of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people, and the value of their estates; and soon after, they were invested\n\t\t\t\t\twith the authority not only of inspecting the morals of individuals, but of\n\t\t\t\t\tinflicting public censure for any licentiousness of conduct, or violation of\n\t\t\t\t\tdecency. Thus both the civil and religious institutions concurred to restrain\n\t\t\t\t\tthe people within the bounds of good order and obedience to the laws; at the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame time that the frugal life of the ancient Romans proved a strong security\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst those vices which operate most effectually towards sapping the\n\t\t\t\t\tfoundations of a state. \n\t\t\t\t But in the time of Julius Casar the barriers of public liberty were become too\n\t\t\t\t\tweak to restrain the audacious efforts of ambitious and desperate men. The\n\t\t\t\t\tveneration for the constitution, usually a powerful check to treasonable\n\t\t\t\t\tdesigns, had been lately violated by the usurpations of Marius and Sylla. The\n\t\t\t\t\tsalutary terrors of religion no longer predominated over the consciences of men.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe shame of public censure was extinguished in general depravity. An eminent\n\t\t\t\t\thistorian, who lived at that time, informs us, that venality universally\n\t\t\t\t\tprevailed amongst the Romans; and a writer who flourished soon after, observes,\n\t\t\t\t\tthat luxury and dissipation had encumbered almost all so much with debt, that\n\t\t\t\t\tthey beheld with a degree of complacency the prospect of civil war and\n\t\t\t\t\tconfusion. \n\t\t\t\t The extreme degree of profligacy at which the Romans were now arrived is in\n\t\t\t\t\tnothing more evident, than that this age gave birth to the most horrible\n\t\t\t\t\tconspiracy which occurs in the annals of human kind, viz. that of Catiline. This\n\t\t\t\t\twas not the project of a few desperate and abandoned individuals, but of a\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber of men of the most illustrious rank in the state; and it appears beyond\n\t\t\t\t\tdoubt, that Julius Caesar was accessory to the design, which was no less than to\n\t\t\t\t\textirpate the Senate, divide amongst themselves both the public and private\n\t\t\t\t\ttreasures, and set Rome on fire. The\n\t\t\t\t\tcauses which prompted to this tremendous project,'it is generally admitted, were\n\t\t\t\t\tluxury, prodigality, irreligion, a total corruption of manners, and above all,\n\t\t\t\t\tas the immediate cause, the pressing necessity in which the conspirators were\n\t\t\t\t\tinvolved by their extreme dissipation. \n\t\t\t\t The enormous debt in which Caesar himself was early involved, countenances an\n\t\t\t\t\topinion that his anxiety to procure the province of Gaul proceeded chiefly from this cause. But during nine years\n\t\t\t\t\tin which he held that province, he acquired such riches as must have rendered\n\t\t\t\t\thim, without competition, the most opulent person in the state. If nothing more,\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore, than a splendid establishment had been the object of his pursuit, he\n\t\t\t\t\thad attained to the summit of his wishes. But when we find him persevering in a\n\t\t\t\t\tplan of aggrandizement beyond this period of his fortunes, we can ascribe his\n\t\t\t\t\tconduct to no other motive than that of outrageous ambition. He projected the\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilding of a new Forum at Rome , for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ground only of which he was to pay $4,ooo000,000; he raised legions in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Gaul at his own charges; he\n\t\t\t\t\tpromised such entertamments to the people as had never been known at Rome from the foundation of the city. All\n\t\t\t\t\tthese circumstances evince some latent design of procuring such a popularity as\n\t\t\t\t\tmight give him an uncontrolled influence in the management of public affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\tPompey, we are told, was wont to to say, that Caesar not being able, with all\n\t\t\t\t\this riches, to fulfil the promises which he had made, wished to throw everything\n\t\t\t\t\tinto confusion. There may have been some foundation for this remark: but the\n\t\t\t\t\topinion of Cicero is more probable, that Caesar's mind was seduced with the\n\t\t\t\t\ttemptations of chimerical glory. It is observable that neither Cicero nor Pompey\n\t\t\t\t\tintimates any suspicion that Caesar was apprehensive of being impeached for his\n\t\t\t\t\tconduct, had he returned to Rome in a\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate station. Yet, that there was reason for such an apprehension, the\n\t\t\t\t\tpositive declaration of L. Domitius leaves little room to doubt: especially when\n\t\t\t\t\twe consider the number of enemies that Caesar had in the Senate, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tcoolness of his former friend Pompey ever after the death of Julia. The proposed\n\t\t\t\t\timpeachment was founded upon a notorious charge of prosecuting measures\n\t\t\t\t\tdestructive of the interests of the commonwealth, and tending ultimately to an\n\t\t\t\t\tobject incompatible with public freedom. Indeed, considering the extreme\n\t\t\t\t\tcorruption which prevailed amongst the Romans at this time, it is more than\n\t\t\t\t\tprobable that Caesar would have been acquitted of the charge, but at such an\n\t\t\t\t\texpense as must have stripped him of all his riches, and placed him again in a\n\t\t\t\t\tsituation ready to attempt a disturbance of the public tranquillity. For it is\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid, that he purchased the friendship of Curio, at the commencement of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcivil war, with a bribe little short of half a million sterling. \n\t\t\t\t Whatever Caesar's private motive may have been for taking arms against his\n\t\t\t\t\tcountry, he embarked in an enterprise of a nature the most dangerous: and had\n\t\t\t\t\tPompey conducted himself in any degree suitable to the reputation which he had\n\t\t\t\t\tformerly acquired, the contest would in all probability have terminated in\n\t\t\t\t\tfavour of public freedom. But by dilatory measures in the beginning, by\n\t\t\t\t\timprudently withdrawing his army from Italy into a distant province, and by not pursuing the\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantage he had gained by the vigorous repulse of Caesar's troops in their\n\t\t\t\t\tattack upon his camp, this commander lost every opportunity of extinguishing a\n\t\t\t\t\twar which was to determine the fate, and even the existence, of the Republic. It\n\t\t\t\t\twas accordingly determined on the plains of Pharsalia, where Caesar obtained a\n\t\t\t\t\tvictory which was not more decisive than unexpected. He was now no longer\n\t\t\t\t\tamenable either to the tribunal of the Senate or the power of the laws, but\n\t\t\t\t\ttriumphed at once over his enemies and the constitution of his country. \n\t\t\t\t It is to the honour of Caesar, that when he had obtained the supreme power, he\n\t\t\t\t\texercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by\n\t\t\t\t\tthose who had fought on the side of the Republic. Of his private life either\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore or after this period, little is transmitted in history. Henceforth,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, he seems to have lived chiefly at Rome , near which he had a small villa, upon an eminence,\n\t\t\t\t\tcommanding a beautiful prospect. His time was almost entirely occupied with\n\t\t\t\t\tpublic affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many agents, he\n\t\t\t\t\tappears to have had none in the character of actual minister. He was in general\n\t\t\t\t\teasy of access: but Cicero, in a letter to a friend, complains of having been\n\t\t\t\t\ttreated with the indignity of waiting a considerable time amongst a crowd in an\n\t\t\t\t\tanti-chamber, before he could have an audience. The elevation of Caesar placed\n\t\t\t\t\thim not above discharging reciprocally the social duties in the intercourse of\n\t\t\t\t\tlife. He returned the visits of those who waited upon him, and would sup at\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir houses. At table, and in the use of wine, he was habitually temperate.\n\t\t\t\t\tUpon the whole, he added nothing to his own happiness by all the dangers, the\n\t\t\t\t\tfatigues, and the perpetual anxiety which he had incurred in the pursuit of\n\t\t\t\t\tunlimited power. His health was greatly impaired: his former cheerfulness of\n\t\t\t\t\ttemper, though not his magnanimity, appears to have forsaken him; and we behold\n\t\t\t\t\tin his fate a memorable example of illustrious talents rendered, by inordinate\n\t\t\t\t\tambition, destructive to himself, and irretrievably pernicious to his country.\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t"
