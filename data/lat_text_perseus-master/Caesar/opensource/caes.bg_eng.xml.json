But even if, driven on by rage and madness, he should make war\n                    upon them, what after all were they afraid of?-or why should they despair either\n                    of their own valor or of his zeal? Of that enemy a trial had been made within\n                    our fathers' recollection, when, on the defeat of the  and\n                         by , the army was regarded as\n                    having deserved no less praise than their commander himself. It had been made\n                    lately, too, in , during the\n                    rebellion of the slaves, whom, however, the experience and training which they\n                    had received from us, assisted in some respect. From which a judgment might be\n                    formed of the advantages which resolution carries with it inasmuch as those whom\n                    for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when unarmed, they had afterward\n                    vanquished, when well armed and flushed with success. In short, that these were\n                    the same men whom the , in frequent\n                    encounters, not only in their own territories, but also in theirs [the\n                        , have generally vanquished, and yet can not have been a\n                    match for our army. If the unsuccessful battle and flight of the  disquieted any, these, if they made inquiries,\n                    might discover that, when the  had been tired\n                    out by the long duration of the war, , after he had many\n                    months kept himself in his camp and in the marshes, and had given no opportunity\n                    for an engagement, fell suddenly upon them, by this time despairing of a battle\n                    and scattered in all directions, and was victorious more through stratagem and\n                    cunning than valor. But though there had been room for such stratagem against\n                    savage and unskilled men, not even [] himself expected\n                    that thereby our armies could be entrapped.

But that, if no one else should follow, yet he would go with only the\n                    tenth legion, of which he had no misgivings, and it should be his praetorian\n                    cohort.\" This legion  had both greatly favored,\n                    and in it, on account of its valor, placed the greatest confidence."}, {"name": [{"@type": "pers", "#text": "Caesar"}, "Divitiacus", "Ariovistus"], "milestone": {"@n": "42", "@unit": "chapter"}, "#text": "Upon the delivery of this speech, the minds of all were changed in a surprising\n                    manner, and the highest ardor and eagerness for prosecuting the war were\n                    engendered; and the tenth legion was the first to return thanks to him, through\n                    their military tribunes, for his having expressed this most favorable opinion of\n                    them; and assured him that they were quite ready to prosecute the war.

Therefore,\n                    although the greatest difficulty in forming a bridge was presented to him, on\n                    account of the breadth, rapidity, and depth of the river, he nevertheless\n                    considered that it ought to be attempted by him, or that his army ought not\n                    otherwise to be led over.

These beams were bound together by\n                    timber laid over them, in the direction of the length of the bridge, and were\n                    [then] covered over with laths and hurdles; and in addition to this, piles were\n                    driven into the water obliquely, at the lower side of the bridge, and these,\n                    serving as buttresses, and being connected with every portion of the work,\n                    sustained the force of the stream: and there were others also above the bridge,\n                    at a moderate distance; that if trunks of trees or vessels were floated down the\n                    river by the barbarians for the purpose of destroying the work, the violence of\n                    such things might be diminished by these defenses, and might not injure the\n                    bridge."}, {"name": [{"@type": "pers", "#text": "Caesar"}, "Sigambri", "Sigambri", "Tenchtheri", "Usipetes"], "milestone": {"@n": "19", "@unit": "chapter"}, "#text": "Within ten days after the timber began to be collected, the whole work was\n                    completed, and the whole army led over. , leaving\n                    a strong guard at each end of the bridge, hastens into the territories of the\n                        .

What courage do you think would our relatives and friends have, if\n                    eighty thousand men were butchered in one spot, supposing that they should be\n                    forced to come to an action almost over our corpses?

Do you doubt their fidelity\n                    and firmness because they have not come at the appointed day? What then? Do you\n                    suppose that the  are employed every day in the\n                    outer fortifications for mere amusement? If you can not be assured by their\n                    dispatches, since every avenue is blocked up, take the  as evidence that there approach is drawing near; since they,\n                    intimidated by alarm at this, labor night and day at their works. What,\n                    therefore, is my design? To do as our ancestors did in the war against the\n                         and , which was by no means equally\n                    momentous who, when driven into their towns, and oppressed by similar\n                    privations, supported life by the corpses of those who appeared useless for war\n                    on account of their age, and did not surrender to the enemy: and even if we had\n                    not a precedent for such cruel conduct, still I should consider it most glorious\n                    that one should be established, and delivered to posterity. For in what was that\n                    war like this? The , after laying  waste, and\n                    inflicting great calamities, at length departed from our country, and sought\n                    other lands; they left us our rights, laws, lands, and liberty.

For they\n                    never have carried on wars on any other terms.
