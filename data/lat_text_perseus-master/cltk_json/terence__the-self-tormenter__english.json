        "0":"\n THE SUBJECT. \n CHREMES commands his wife, when pregnant, if she is delivered of a girl\n immediately to kill the child. Having given birth to a girl, Sostrata\n delivers her to an old woman named Philtera to be exposed. Instead of doing\n this, Philtera calls her Antiphila, and brings her up as her own. Clinia,\n the son of Menedemus, falls in love with her, and treats her as though his\n wife. Menedemus, on learning this, is very angry, and by his harsh language\n drives away his son from home. Taking this to heart, and in order to punish\n himself for his ill-timed severity, Menedemus, though now an aged man,\n fatigues himself by laboring at agricultural pursuits from morning till\n night. At the period when the Play commences, Clinia has just returned to\n Attica , but not daring to go to\n his father's house, is entertained by Clitipho, the son of Chremes, who is\n the neighbor of Menedemus. Clitipho then sends for Antiphila, whose supposed\n mother has recently died, to come and meet her lover. On the same day,\n Chremes learns from Menedemus how anxious he is for his son's return; and on\n hearing from his son of the arrival of Clinia, he defers informing Menedemus\n of it until the next day. Syrus, the servant who has been sent to fetch\n Antiphila, also brings with him Bacchis, an extravagant Courtesan, the\n mistress of Clitipho. To conceal the truth from Chremes, they represent to\n him that Bacchis is the mistress of Clinia, and that Antiphila is one of her\n maids. Next morning Chremes informs Menedemus of his son's arrival, and of\n the extravagant conduct of his mistress, but begs that he will conceal from\n Clinia his knowledge of this fact. Bacchis requiring ten minae, Syrus\n devises a plan for obtaining the money from Chremes, while the latter is\n encouraging him to think of a project against Menedemus. Syrus tells him a\n story, that the mother of Antiphila had borrowed a thousand drachmae of\n Bacchis, and being dead, the girl is left in her hands as a pledge for the\n money. While these things are going on, Sostrata discovers in Antiphila her\n own daughter. In order to obtain the money which Bacchis persists in\n demanding, Syrus suggests to Chremes that it should be represented to\n Menedemus that Bacchis is the mistress of Clitipho, and that he should be\n requested to conceal her in his house for a few days; it is also arranged\n that Clinia shall pretend to his father to be in love with Antiphila, and to\n beg her as his wife. He is then to ask for money, as though for the wedding,\n which is to be handed over to Bacchis. Chremes does not at first approve of\n the plan suggested by Syrus; but he pays down the money for which he has\n been informed' his daughter is a pledge in the hands of Bacchis. This, with\n his knowledge, is given to Clitipho, who, as Syrus says, is to convey it to\n Bacchis, who is now in the house of Menedemus, to make the latter more\n readily believe that she is his mistress. Shortly after this, the plot is\n discovered by Chremes, who threatens to punish Clitipho and Syrus. The Play\n concludes with Chremes giving his consent to the marriage of Clinia with\n Antiphila, and pardoning Clitipho, who promises to abandon the Courtesan,\n and marry. Unlike the other Plays of Terence and Plautus, the Plot of this\n Play extends over two days. \n ",
        "1":"\n THE TITLE OF THE PLAY. \n IT is from the Greek of Menander. Performed at the Megalensian Games; Lucius\n Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Valerius Flaccus being Curule Aediles.\n Ambivius Turpio performed it. Flaccus, the freedman of Claudius, composed\n the music. The first time it was performed to the music of treble and bass\n flutes; the second time, of two treble flutes. It was acted three times;\n Marcus Juventius and Titus Sempronius being Consuls. \n HEAUTONTIMORUMENOS; \n THE SELF-TORMENTOR. \n \n ",
        "2":"\n THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS. \n A SEVERE father compels his son Clinia, in love with Antiphila, to go abroad\n to the wars; and repenting of what has been done, torments himself in mind.\n Afterward, when he has returned, unknown to his father, he is entertained at\n the house of Clitipho. The latter is in love with Bacchis, a Courtesan. When\n Clinia sends for his much-loved Antiphila, Bacchis comes, as though his\n mistress, and Antiphila, wearing the garb of her servant; this is done in\n order that Clitipho may conceal it from his father. He, through the\n stratagems of Syrus, gets ten minae from the old man for the Courtesan.\n Antiphila is discovered to be the sister of Clitipho. Clinia receives her,\n and Clitipho, another woman, for his wife. \n ",
        "3":"\n \n THE PROLOGUE. \n LEST it should be a matter of surprise to any one of you, why the Poet\n has assigned to an old man \n a part that belongs to the young, that I will\n first explain to you; \n and then, the reason\n for my coming I will disclose. An entire Play from an entire Greek\n one, \n the Heautontimorumenos, I\n am to-day about to represent, which from a two-fold plot \n has been made but one. I have shown that it is\n new, and what it is: next I would mention who it was that wrote it, and\n whose in Greek it is, if I did not think that the greater part of you\n are aware. Now, for what reason I have learned this part, in a few words\n I will explain. The Poet intended me to be a Pleader, \n not the Speaker of a\n Prologue; your decision he asks, and has appointed me the advocate; if\n this advocate can avail as much by his oral powers as he has excelled in\n inventing happily, who composed this speech which I am about to recite.\n For as to malevolent rumors spreading abroad that he has mixed together\n many Greek Plays while writing a few Latin ones, he does not deny that\n this is the case, and that he does not repent of so doing; and he\n affirms that he will do so again. He has the example of good Poets;\n after which example he thinks it is allowable for him to do what they\n have done. Then, as to a malevolent old Poet \n saying that\n he has suddenly applied himself to dramatic pursuits, relying on the\n genius of his friends, \n and not his own natural abilities; on that\n your judgment your your opinion, will prevail. Wherefore I do entreat\n you all, that the suggestions of our antagonists may not avail more than\n those of our favorers. Do. you be favorable; grant the means of\n prospering to those who afford you the means of being spectators of new\n Plays; those, I mean, without faults: that he may not suppose this said\n in his behalf who lately made the public give way to a slave as he ran\n along in the street; \n why should\n he take a madman's part? About his faults he will say more when he\n brings out some other new ones, unless he puts an end to his caviling.\n Attend with favorable feelings; grant me the opportunity that I may be\n allowed to act a quiet Play \n in silence;\n that the servant everlastingly running about, the angry old man, the\n gluttonous parasite, the impudent sharper, and the greedy procurer, may\n not have always to be performed by me with the utmost expense of voice,\n and the greatest exertion. For my sake come to the conclusion that this\n request is fair, that so some portion of my labor may be abridged. For\n nowadays, those who write new Plays do not spare an aged man. If there\n is any piece requiring exertion, they come running to me; but if it is a\n light one, it is taken to another Company. In the present one the style\n is pure. Do you make proof, what, in each character, \n my ability can\n effect. If I have never greedily set a high price upon my skill, and\n have come to the conclusion that this is my greatest gain, as far as\n possible to be subservient to your convenience, establish in me a\n precedent, that the young may be anxious rather to please you than\n themselves. \n \n ",
        "4":"\n Enter CHREMES, and MENEDEMUS with a spade in his hand, who falls to\n digging. \n \n CHREMES \n Although this acquaintanceship between us is of very recent date, from\n the time in fact of your purchasing an estate here in the neighborhood,\n yet either your good qualities, or our being neighbors (which I take to\n be a sort of friendship), induces me to inform you, frankly and\n familiarly, that you appear to me to labor beyond your years, and beyond\n what your affairs require. For, in the name of Gods and men, what would\n you have? What can be your aim? You are, as I conjecture, sixty years of\n age, or more. No man in these parts has a better or a more valuable\n estate, no one more servants; and yet you discharge their duties just as\n diligently as if there were none at all. However early in the morning I\n go out, and however late in the evening I return home, I see you either\n digging, or plowing, or doing something, in fact, in the fields. You\n take respite not an instant, and are quite regardless of yourself. I am\n very sure that this is not done for your amusement. But really I am\n vexed how little work is done here. \n If you were to\n employ the time you spend in laboring yourself, in keeping your servants\n at work, you would profit much more. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Have you so much leisure, Chremes, from your own affairs, that you can\n attend to those of others-those which don't concern you? \n \n \n CHREMES \n I am a man, \n and nothing that concerns a man do I deem a matter\n of indifference to me. Suppose that I wish either to advise you in this\n matter, or to be informed myself: if what you do is right, that I may do\n the same; if it is not, then that I may dissuade you. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n It's requisite for me to do so; do you as it is necessary for you to\n do. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Is it requisite for any person to torment himself? \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n It is for me. \n \n \n CHREMES \n If you have any affliction, I could wish it otherwise. But prithee, what\n sorrow is this of yours? How have you deserved so ill of yourself? \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Alas! alas! He begins to weep. \n \n \n \n CHREMES \n Do not weep, but make me acquainted with it, whatever it is. Do not be\n reserved; fear nothing; trust me, I tell you. Either by consolation, or\n by counsel, or by any means, I will aid you. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Do you wish to know this matter? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Yes, and for the reason I mentioned to you. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n I will tell you. \n \n \n CHREMES \n But still, in the mean time, lay down that rake; don't fatigue\n yourself. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n By no means. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What can be your object? Tries to take the rake from\n him. \n \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Do leave me alone, that I may give myself no respite from my labor. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I will not allow it, I tell you. Taking the rake from\n him. \n \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Ah! that's not fair. \n \n \n CHREMES \n \n poising the rake. Whew! such a heavy one as this,\n pray! \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Such are my deserts. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Now speak. Laying down the rake. \n \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n I have an only son,--a young man,--alas! why did I say--\" I\n have?\"--rather I should say, \"I had\" one, Chremes:--whether I have him\n now, or not, is uncertain. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Why so? \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n You shall know:--There is a poor old woman here, a stranger from\n Corinth :--her daughter, a\n young woman, he fell in love with, insomuch that he almost regarded her\n as his wife; all this took place unknown to me. When I discovered the\n matter, I began to reprove him, not with gentleness, nor in the way\n suited to the love-sick mind of a youth, but with violence, and after\n the usual method of fathers. I was daily reproaching him,--\"Look you, do\n you expect to be allowed any longer to act thus, myself, your father,\n being alive; to be keeping a mistress pretty much as though your wife?\n You are mistaken, Clinia, and you don't know me, if you fancy that. I am\n willing that you should be called my son, just as long as you do what\n becomes you; but if you do not do so, I shall find out how it becomes me\n to act toward you. This arises from nothing, in fact, but too much\n idleness. At your time of life, I did not devote my time to dalliance,\n but, in consequence of my poverty, departed. hence for Asia , and there acquired in arms both\n riches and military glory.\" At length the matter came to this,--the\n youth, from hearing the same things so often, and with such severity,\n was overcome. He supposed that I, through age and affection, had more\n judgment and foresight for him than him-self. He went off to Asia , Chremes, to serve under the\n king. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What is it you say? \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n He departed without my knowledge--and lias been gone these three\n months. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Both are to be blamed--although I still think this step shows an\n ingenuous and enterprising disposition. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n When I learned this from those who were in the secret, I returned home\n sad, and with feelings almost over-whelmed and distracted through grief.\n I sit down; my servants run to me; they take off my shoes: \n then some make all haste\n to spread the couches, \n and to prepare a repast; each according to his\n ability did zealously what he could, in order to alleviate my sorrow.\n When I observed this, I began to reflect thus:--\"What! are so many\n persons anxious for my sake alone, to pleasure myself only? Are so many\n female servants to provide me with dress? \n Shall I alone keep up such an\n expensive establishment, while my only son, who ought equally, or even\n more so, to enjoy these things-inasmuch as his age is better suited for\n the enjoyment of them--him, poor youth, have I driven away from home by\n my severity! Were I to do this, really I should deem myself deserving of\n any calamity. But so long as he leads this life of penury, banished from\n his country through my severity, I will revenge his wrongs upon myself,\n toiling, making money, saving, and laying up for him.\" At once I set\n about it; I left nothing in the house, neither movables \n nor\n clothing; every thing I scraped together. Slaves, male and female,\n except those who could easily pay for their keep by working in the\n country, all of them I set up to auction and sold. I at once put up a\n bill to sell my house. \n I collected somewhere about fifteen\n talents, and purchased this farm; here I fatigue myself: I have come to\n this conclusion, Chremes, that I do my son a less injury, while I am\n unhappy; and that it is not right for me to enjoy any pleasure here,\n until such time as he returns home safe to share it with me. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I believe you to be of an affectionate disposition toward your\n children, \n and him to be an obedient son, if one\n were to manage him rightly or prudently. But neither did you understand\n him sufficiently well, nor he you-a thing that happens where persons\n don't live on terms of frankness together. You never showed him how\n highly you valued him, nor did he ever dare put that confidence in you\n which is due to a father. Had this been done, these troubles would never\n have befallen you. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Such is the fact, I confess; the greatest fault is on my side. \n \n \n CHREMES \n But still, Menedemus, I hope for the best, and I trust that he'll be\n here safe before long. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Oh that the Gods would grant it! \n \n \n CHREMES \n They will do so. Now, if it is convenient to you--the festival of\n Bacchus \n \n is being kept here to-day--I\n wish you to give me your company. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n I can not. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Why not? Do, pray, spare yourself a little while. Your absent son would\n wish you do so. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n It is not right that I, who have driven him hence to endure hardships,\n should now shun them myself. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Is such your determination? \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n It is. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Then kindly fare you wall. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n And you the same. Goes into his house. \n \n \n \n CHREMES \n \n to himself. He has forced tears from me, and I do pity\n him. But as the day is far gone, I must remind Phania, this neighbor of\n mine, to come to dinner. I'll go see whether he is at home. Goes\n to PHANIA'S door, makes the inquiry, and returns. There was\n no occasion for me to remind him: they tell me he has been some time\n already at my house; it's I myself am making my guests wait. I'll go\n in-doors immediately. But what means the noise at the door of my house?\n I wonder who's coming out! I'll step aside here. He stands\n aside. \n \n \n ",
        "5":"\n Enter CLITIPHO, from the house of CHREMES. \n \n CLITIPHO \n \n at the door, to CLINIA within. There is nothing, Clinia,\n for you to fear as yet: they have not been long by any means: and I am\n sure that she will be with you presently along with the messenger. Do at\n once dismiss these causeless apprehensions which are tormenting you.\n \n \n \n CHREMES \n \n apart. Who is my son talking to? Makes his\n appearance. \n \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n \n to himself. Here comes my father, whom I wished to see:\n I'll accost him. Father, you have met me opportunely. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What is the matter? \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Do you know this neighbor of ours, Menedemus? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Very well. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Do you know that he has a son? \n \n \n CHREMES \n I have heard that he has; in Asia . \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n He is not in Asia , father; he\n is at :our house. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What is it you say? \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Upon his arrival, after he had just landed from the ship, I immediately\n brought him to dine with us; for from our very childhood upward I have\n always been on intimate terms with him.. \n \n \n CHREMES \n You announce to me a great pleasure. How much I wish that Menedemus had\n accepted my invitation to make one of us: that at my house I might have\n been the first to surprise him, when not expecting it, with this\n delight!--and even yet there's time enough---- \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Take care what you do; there is no necessity, father, for doing so. \n \n \n CHREMES \n For what reason? \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Why, because he is as yet undetermined what to do with himself. He is\n but just arrived. He fears every thing; his father's displeasure, and\n how his mistress may be disposed toward him. He loves her to\n distraction: on her account, this trouble and going abroad took\n place. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I know it. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n He has just sent a servant into the city to her, and I ordered our Syrus\n to go with him. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What does Clinia say? \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n What does he say? That he is wretched. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Wretched? Whom could we less suppose so? What is there wanting for him\n to enjoy every thing that among men, in fact, are esteemed as blessings?\n Parents, a country in prosperity, friends, family, relations, riches?\n And yet, all these are just according to the disposition of him who\n possesses them. To him who knows how to use them, they are blessings; to\n him who does not use them rightly, they are evils. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Aye, but lie always was a morose old man; and now I dread nothing more,\n father, than that in his displeasure he'll be doing something to him\n more than is justifiable. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What, he? Aside. But I'll restrain myself; for that the\n other one should be in fear of his father is of service to\n him. \n \n \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n What is it you are saying to yourself? \n \n \n CHREMES \n I'll tell you. However the case stood, Clinia ought still to have\n remained at home. Perhaps his father was a little stricter than he\n liked: he should have put up with it. For whom ought he to bear with, if\n he would not bear with his own father Was it reasonable that he should\n live after his son's humor, or his son after his? And as to charging him\n with harshness, it is not the fact. For the severities of fathers are\n generally of one character, those I mean who are in some degree\n reasonable men. \n They do not\n wish their sons to be always wenching; they do not wish them to be\n always carousing; they give a limited allowance; and yet all this tends\n to virtuous conduct. But when the mind, Clitipho, has once enslaved\n itself by vicious appetites, it must of necessity follow similar\n pursuits. This is a wise maxim, \"to take warning from others of what may\n be to your own advantage.\" \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n I believe so. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I'll now go hence in-doors, to see what we have for dinner. Do you,\n seeing what is the time of day, mind and take care not to be any where\n out of the way. Goes into his house, and exit CLITIPHO. \n \n \n ",
        "6":"\n Enter CLITIPHO. \n \n CLITIPHO \n \n to himself. What partial judges are all fathers in regard\n to all of us young men, in thinking it reasonable for us to become old\n men all at once from boys, and not to participate in those things which\n youth is naturally inclined to. They regulate us by their own\n desires,--such as they now are,--not as they once were. If ever I have a\n son, he certainly shall find in me an indulgent father. For the means\n both of knowing and of pardoning \n his faults shall be found by me; not like mine,\n who by means of another person, discloses to me his own sentiments. I'm\n plagued to death,--when he drinks a little more than usual, what pranks\n of his own he does relate to me! Now he says, \"Take warning from others\n of what may be to your advantage.\" How shrewd! He certainly does not\n know how deaf I am at the moment when he's telling his stories. Just\n now, the words of my mistress make more impression upon me. \"Give me\n this, and bring me that,\" she cries; I have nothing to say to her in\n answer, and no one is there more wretched than myself. But this Clinia,\n although he, as well, has cares enough of his own, still has a mistress\n of virtuous and modest breeding, and a stranger to the arts of a\n courtesan. Mine is a craving, saucy, haughty, extravagant creature, full\n of lofty airs. Then all that I have to give her is--fair words \n --for\n I make it a point not to tell her that I have nothing.

On this occasion might be known, Clinia, or else on none, in\n what pursuits she passed her life during your absence; when we thus came\n upon a female unexpectedly. For this circumstance then gave us an\n opportunity of judging of the course of her daily life; a thing which\n especially discovers what is the disposition of each individual. We\n found her industriously plying at the web; plainly clad in a mourning\n dress, \n on account of this old woman, I suppose, who\n was lately dead; without golden ornaments, dressed, besides, just like\n those who only dress for themselves, and patched up with no worthless\n woman's trumpery. \n Her hair was\n loose, long, and thrown back negligently about her temples. To\n CLINIA. Do you hold your peace. \n \n \n \n \n CLINIA \n My dear Syrus, do not without cause throw me into ecstasies, I beseech\n you. \n \n \n SYRUS \n The old woman was spinning the woof: \n there was one little servant girl\n besides;--she was weaving \n together with them, covered with patched\n clothes, slovenly, and dirty with filthiness. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n If this is true, Clinia, as I believe it is, who is there more fortunate\n than you? Do you mark this girl whom he speaks of, as dirty and\n drabbish? This, too, is a strong indication that the mistress is out of\n harm's way, when her confidant is in such ill plight; for it is a rule\n with those who wish to gain access to the mistress, first to bribe the\n maid. \n \n \n CLINIA \n \n to SYRUS. Go on, I beseech you; and beware of endeavoring\n to purchase favor by telling an untruth. What did she say, when you\n mentioned me? \n \n \n SYRUS \n When we told her that you had returned, and had requested her to come to\n you, the damsel instantly put away the web, and covered her face all\n over with tears; so that you might easily perceive that it really was\n caused by her affection for you. \n \n \n CLINIA \n So may the Deities bless me, I know not where I am for joy! I was so\n alarmed before. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n But I was sure that there was no reason, Clinia. Come now, Syrus, tell\n me, in my turn, who this other lady is. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Your Bacchis, whom we are bringing. \n \n \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Ha! What! Bacchis? How now, you rascal! whither are you bringing\n her? \n \n \n SYRUS \n Whither am I bringing her? To our house, to be sure. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n What! to my father's? \n \n \n SYRUS \n To the very same. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Oh, the audacious impudence of the fellow! \n \n \n SYRUS \n Hark'ye, no great and memorable action is done without some risk. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Look now; are you seeking to gain credit for yourself, at the hazard of\n my character, you rascal, in a point, where, if you only make the\n slightest slip, I am ruined? What would you be doing with her? \n \n \n SYRUS \n But still---- \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Why \"still?\" \n \n \n SYRUS \n If you'll give me leave, I'll tell you. \n \n \n CLINIA \n Do give him leave. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n I give him leave then. \n \n \n SYRUS \n This affair is now just as though when---- \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Plague on it, what roundabout story is he beginning to tell me? \n \n \n CLINIA \n Syrus, he says what's right--do omit digressions; come to the point. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Really I can not hold my tongue. Clitipho, you are every way unjust, and\n can not possibly be endured. \n \n \n CLINIA \n Upon my faith, he ought to have a hearing. To CLITIPHO. \n Do be silent. \n \n \n SYRUS \n You wish to indulge in your amours; you wish to possess your mistress;\n you wish that to be procured where-withal to make her presents; in\n getting this, you do not wish the risk to be your own. You are not wise\n to no purpose,--if indeed it is being wise to wish for that which can\n not happen. Either the one must be had with the other, or the one must\n be let alone with the other. Now, of these two alternatives, consider\n which one you would prefer; although this project which I have formed, I\n know to be both a wise and a safe one. For there is an opportunity for\n your mistress to be with you at your father's house, without fear of a\n discovery; besides, by these self-same means, I shall find the money\n which you have promised her--to effect which, you have already made my\n ears deaf with entreating me. What would you have more? \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n If, indeed, this could be brought about---- \n \n \n SYRUS \n If, indeed? You shall know it by experience. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Well, well, disclose this project of yours. What is it? \n \n \n SYRUS \n We will pretend that your mistress is his (pointing to CLINIA). \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Very fine! Tell me, what is he to do with his own? Is she, too, to be\n called his, as if one was not a sufficient discredit? \n \n \n SYRUS \n No--she shall be taken to your mother. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Why there? \n \n \n SYRUS \n It would be tedious, Clitipho, if I were to tell you why I do so; I have\n a good reason. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Stuff! I see no grounds sufficiently solid why it should be for my\n advantage to incur this risk. \n \n Turning as if going. \n \n \n \n SYRUS \n Stay; if there is this risk, I have another project, which you must both\n confess to be free from danger. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Find out something of that description, I beseech you. \n \n \n SYRUS \n By all means; I'll go meet her, and tell her to return home. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Ha! what was it you said? \n \n \n SYRUS \n I'll rid you at once of all fears, so that you may sleep at your ease\n upon either ear. \n \n \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n What am I to do now? \n \n \n CLINIA \n What are you to do? The goods that---- \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Only tell me the truth, Syrus. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Dispatch quickly; you'll be wishing just now too late and in vain.\n Going. \n \n \n \n CLINIA \n The Gods provide, enjoy while yet you may; for you know not---- \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n \n calling. Syrus, I say! \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n moving on. Go on; I shall still do that which 1\n said. \n \n \n \n \n CLINIA \n Whether you may have another opportunity hereafter or ever again. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n I'faith, that's true. Calling. Syrus, Syrus, I say,\n harkye, harkye, Syrus! \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n aside. He warms a little. To CLITIPHO. \n What is it you want? \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Come back, come back. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n coming back to him. Hero I am; tell me what you would\n have. You'll be presently saying that this, too, doesn't please you. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Nay, Syrus, I commit myself, and my love, and my reputation entirely to\n you: you are the seducer; take care you don't deserve any blame. \n \n \n SYRUS \n It is ridiculous for you to give me that caution, Clitipho, as if my\n interest was less at stake in this affair than yours. Here, if any ill\n luck should perchance befall us, words will be in readiness for you, but\n for this individual blows pointing to himself . For that\n reason, this matter is by no means to be neglected on my part: but do\n prevail upon him pointing to CLINIA to pretend that she\n is his own mistress. \n \n \n CLINIA \n You may rest assured I'll do so. The matter has now come to that pass,\n that it is a case of necessity. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n 'Tis with good reason that I love you, Clinia. \n \n \n CLINIA \n But she mustn't be tripping at all. \n \n \n SYRUS \n She is thoroughly tutored in her part. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n But this I wonder at, how you could so easily prevail upon her, who is\n wont to treat such great peoplel \n with\n scorn. \n \n \n SYRUS \n I came to her at the proper moment, which in all things is of the first\n importance: for there I found a certain wretched captain soliciting her\n favors: she artfully managed the man, so as to inflame his eager\n passions by denial; and this, too, that it might be especially pleasing\n to yourself. But hark you, take care, will you, not to be imprudently\n impetuous. You know your father, how quick-sighted he is in these\n matters; and I know you, how unable you are to command yourself. Keep\n clear of words of double meaning, \n your\n sidelong looks, sighing, hemming, coughing, tittering. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n You shall have to commend me. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Take care of that, please. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n You yourself shall be surprised at me. \n \n \n SYRUS \n But how quickly the ladies have come up with us! \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Where are they? SYRUS stands before him. Why do you hold\n me back? \n \n \n SYRUS \n For the present she is nothing to you. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n I know it, before my father; but now in the mean time---- \n \n \n SYRUS \n Not a bit the more. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Do let me. \n \n \n SYRUS \n I will not let you, I tell you. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n But only for a moment, pray. \n \n \n SYRUS \n I forbid it. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Only to salute her. \n \n \n SYRUS \n If you are wise, get you gone. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n I'm off. But what's he to do? Pointing at CLINIA. \n \n \n \n SYRUS \n He will stay here. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n O happy man! \n \n \n SYRUS \n Take yourself off. (Exit CLITIPHO.) \n \n \n ",

For your discourse has been a\n proof to me what kind of disposition you possess. And when now I reflect\n in my mind upon your way of life, and that of all of you, in fact, who\n keep the public at a distance from yourselves, it is not surprising both\n that you are of that disposition, and that we are not; for it is your\n interest to be virtuous; those, with whom we are acquainted, will not\n allow us to be so. For our lovers, allured merely by our beauty, court\n us for that; when that has faded, they transfer their affections\n elsewhere; and unless we have made provision in the mean time for the\n future, we live in destitution. Now with you, when you have once\n resolved to pass your life with one man whose manners are especially\n kindred to your own, those persons \n become attached to you. By\n this kindly feeling, you are truly devoted to each other; and no\n calamity can ever possibly interrupt your love. \n \n \n ANTIPHILA \n I know nothing about other women: I'm sure that I have, indeed, always\n used every endeavor to derive my own happiness from his happiness. \n \n \n CLINIA \n \n apart, overhearing ANTIPHILA. Ah! 'tis for that reason,\n my Antiphila, that you alone have now caused me to return to my native\n country; for while I was absent from you, all other hardships which I\n encountered were light to me, save the being deprived of you. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n apart. I believe it. \n \n \n CLINIA \n \n apart. Syrus, I can scarce endure it! \n Wretch that I am, that I should not be allowed to\n possess one of such a disposition at my own discretion! \n \n \n SYRUS \n Nay, so far as I understand your father, he will for a long time yet be\n giving you a hard task. \n \n \n BACCHIS. \n Why, who is that young man that's looking at us? \n \n \n ANTIPHILA \n \n seeing CLINIA.

        "10":"\n Enter CHREMES from his house. \n \n CHREMES \n \n to himself. It is now daybreak. \n \n Why do I delay to knock at my neighbor's door, that he may learn from me\n the first that his son has returned? Although I am aware that the youth\n would not prefer this. But when I see him tormenting himself so\n miserably about his absence, can I conceal a joy so unhoped for,\n especially when there can be no danger to him from the discovery? I will\n not do so; but as far as I can I will assist the old man. As I see my\n son aiding his friend and year's-mate, and acting as his confidant in\n his concerns, it is but right that we old men as well should assist each\n other. Enter MENEDEMUS from his house. \n \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n \n to himself Assuredly I was either born with a disposition\n peculiarly suited for misery, or else that saying which I hear commonly\n repeated, that \"time assuages human sorrow,\" is false. For really my\n sorrow about my son increases daily; and the longer he is away from me,\n the more anxiously do I wish for him, and the more I miss him. \n \n \n CHREMES \n \n apart. But I see him coming out of his house; I'll go\n speak to him. Aloud. Menedemus, good-morrow; I bring you\n news, which you would especially desire to be imparted. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Pray, have you heard any thing about my son, Chremes? \n \n \n CHREMES \n He's alive, and well. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Why, where is he, pray? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Here, at my house, at home. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n My son? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Such is the fact. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Come home? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Certainly. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n My son, Clinia, come home? \n \n \n CHREMES \n I say so. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Let us go. Lead me to him, I beg of you. \n \n \n CHREMES \n He does not wish you yet to know of his return, and he shuns your\n presence; he's afraid that, on account of that fault, your former\n severity may even be increased. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Did you not tell him how I was affected? \n \n \n \n \n CHREMES \n No---- \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n For what reason, Chremes? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Because there you would judge extremely ill both for yourself and for\n him, if you were to show yourself of a spirit so weak and\n irresolute. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n I can not help it: enough already, enough, have I proved a rigorous\n father. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Ah Menedemus! you are too precipitate in either extreme, either with\n profuseness or with parsimony too great. Into the same error will you\n fall from the one side as from the other. In the first place, formerly,\n rather than allow your son to visit a young woman, who was then content\n with a very little, and to whom any thing was acceptable, you frightened\n him away from here. After that, she began, quite against her\n inclination, to seek a subsistence upon the town. Now, when she can not\n be supported without a great expense, you are ready to give any thing.\n For, that you may know how perfectly she is trained to extravagance, in\n the first place, she has already brought with her more than ten female\n attendants, all laden with clothes and jewels of gold; if a\n satrap \n had been her admirer, he never could support\n her expenses, much less can you. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Is she at your house ? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Is she, do you ask? I have felt it; for 1 have given her and her retinue\n one dinner; had I to give them another such, it would be all over with\n me; for, to pass by other matters, what a quantity of wine she did\n consume for me in tasting only, \n saying thus, \"This wine is too acid, \n respected\n sir, \n do please look for\n something more mellow.\" I opened all the casks, all the\n vessels \n ; she kept all on the stir: and this but a single\n night. What do you suppose will become of you when they are constantly\n preying upon you? So may the Gods prosper me, Menedemus, I do pity your\n lot. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Let him do what he will; let him take, waste, and squander; I'm\n determined to endure it, so long as I only have him with me. \n \n \n CHREMES \n If it is your determination thus to act, I hold it to be of very great\n foment that he should not be aware that with a full knowledge you grant\n him this. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n What shall I do ? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Any thing, rather than what you are thinking of; supply him with money\n through some other person; suffer yourself to be imposed upon by the\n artifices of his servant: although I have smelt out this too, that they\n are about that, and are secretly planning it among them. Syrus is always\n whispering with that servant of yours; \n they impart their plans to the\n young men; and it were better for you to lose a talent this way, than a\n mina the other. The money is not the question now, but this--in what way\n we can supply it to the young man with the least danger. For if he once\n knows the state of your feelings, that you would sooner part with your\n life, and sooner with all your money, than allow your son to leave you;\n whew ! what an inlet \n will you be opening for\n his debauchery! aye, and so much so, that henceforth to live can not be\n desirable to you. For we all become worse through indulgence. Whatever\n comes into his head, he'll be wishing for; nor will he reflect whether\n that which he desires is right or wrong. You will not be able to endure\n your estate and him going to ruin. You will refuse to supply him: he\n will immediately have recourse to the means by which he finds that he\n has the greatest hold upon you, and threaten that he will immediately\n leave you. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n You seem to speak the truth, and just what is the fact. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I'faith, I have not been sensible of sleep this night with my\n eyes, \n for thinking of this--how to restore your son to you.\n \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n \n taking his hand. Give me your right hand. I request that\n you will still act in a like manner, Chremes. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I am ready to serve you. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Do you know what it is I now want you to do? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Tell me. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n As you have perceived that they are laying a plan to deceive me, that\n they may hasten to complete it. I long to give him whatever he wants: I\n am now longing to behold him. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I'll lend my endeavors. This little business is in my way. Our neighbors\n Simus and Crito are disputing here about boundaries; they have chosen me\n for arbitrator. I'll go and tell them that I can not possibly give them\n my attention to-day as I had stated I would. I'll be here immediately.\n (Exit.) \n \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Pray do. To himself. Ye Gods, by our trust in you! That\n the nature of all men should be so constituted, that they can see and\n judge of other men's affairs better than their own! Is it because in our\n own concerns we are biased either with joy or grief in too great a\n degree How much wiser now is he for me, than I have been for myself!\n Re-enter CHREMES. \n \n \n \n CHREMES \n I have disengaged myself, that I might lend you my services at my\n leisure. Syrus must be found and instructed by me in this business. Some\n one, I know not who, is coming out of my house: do you step hence home,\n that they may not perceive \n that we are conferring together.\n MENEDEMUS goes into his house. \n \n \n ",

I was sadly afraid for you. \n \n \n CHREMES \n To suffer it to come to this! \n \n \n SYRUS \n What was he to do? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Do you ask the question? He ought to have found some expedient,\n contrived some stratagem, by means of which there might have been\n something for the young man to give to his mistress, and thus have saved\n this crabbed old fellow in spite of himself. \n \n \n SYRUS \n You are surely joking. \n \n \n CHREMES \n This ought to have been done by him, Syrus. \n \n \n SYRUS \n How now--pray, do you commend servants, who deceive their masters? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Upon occasion--I certainly do commend them. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Quite right. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Inasmuch as it often is the remedy for great disturbances. Then would\n this man's only son have staid at home. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n aside.

Syrus, I am ashamed of him. \n \n \n SYRUS \n I believe it; and not without reason. Why, he vexes myself even. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n \n to SYRUS. Do you persist, then ? \n \n \n SYRUS \n I' faith, I'm saying the truth, as it appears to me. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n May I not go near them? \n \n \n CHREMES \n How now--pray, is there but one way \n of going near them\n ? \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n aside. Confusion! He'll be betraying himself before I've\n got the money. Aloud. Chremes, will you give attention to\n me, who am but a silly person? \n \n \n CHREMES \n What am I to do? \n \n \n SYRUS \n Bid him go somewhere out of the way. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Where am I to go ? \n \n \n SYRUS \n Where you please; leave the place to them; be off and take a walk. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Take a walk! where ? \n \n \n SYRUS \n Pshaw! Just as if there was no place to walk in. Why, then, go this way,\n that way, where you will. \n \n \n CHREMES \n He says right, I'm of his opinion. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n May the Gods extirpate you, Syrus, for thrusting me away from here. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n aside to CLITIPHO. Then do you for the future keep those\n hands of yours within bounds. Exit CLITIPHO. Really now\n to CHREMES , what do you think? What do you imagine\n will become of him next, unless, so far as the Gods afford you the\n means, you watch him, correct and admonish him ? \n \n \n CHREMES \n I'll take care of that. \n \n \n SYRUS \n But now, master, he must be looked after by you. \n \n \n CHREMES \n It shall be done. \n \n \n SYRUS \n If you are wise,--for now he minds me less and less every day. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What say you? What have you done, Syrus, about that matter which I was\n mentioning to you a short time since? Have you any plan that suits you,\n or not yet even ? \n \n \n SYRUS \n You mean the design upon Menedemus? I have; I have just hit upon\n one. \n \n \n CHREMES \n You are a clever fellow; what is it? Tell me. \n \n \n SYRUS \n I'll tell you; but, as one matter arises out of another---- \n \n \n CHREMES \n Why, what. is it, Syrus? \n \n \n SYRUS \n This Courtesan is a very bad woman. \n \n \n CHREMES \n So she seems. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Aye, if you did but know. O shocking! just see what she is hatching.\n There was a certain old woman here from Corinth ,--this Bacchis lent her a thousand silver\n drachmae. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What then? \n \n \n SYRUS \n She is now dead: she has left a daughter, a young girl. She has been\n left with this Bacchis as a pledge for that sum. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I understand you. \n \n \n SYRUS \n She has brought her hither along with her, her I mean who is now with\n your wife. \n \n \n \n \n CHREMES \n What then ? \n \n \n SYRUS \n She is soliciting Clinia at once to advance her this money; she says,\n however, that this girl is to be a security, that, at a future time, she\n will repay the thousand pieces of money. \n \n \n CHREMES \n And would she really be a security ? \n \n \n \n \n SYRUS \n Dear me, is it to be doubted ? I think so. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What then do you intend doing? \n \n \n SYRUS \n What, I? I shall go to Menedemus; I'll tell him she is a captive from\n Caria , rich, and of noble\n family; if he redeems her, there will be a considerable profit in this\n transaction. \n \n \n CHREMES \n You are in an error. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Why so ? \n \n \n CHREMES \n I'll now answer you for Menedemus--I will not purchase her. \n \n \n SYRUS \n What is it you say? Do speak more agreeably to our wishes. \n \n \n CHREMES \n But there is no occasion. \n \n \n SYRUS \n No occasion? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Certainly not, i' faith. \n \n \n SYRUS \n How so, I wonder? \n \n \n CHREMES \n You shall soon know. \n \n \n \n \n SYRUS \n Stop, stop; what is the reason that there is such a great noise at our\n door ? They retire out of sight. \n \n \n ",

Unless my fancy\n deceives me, surely this is the ring which I suspect it to be, the same with\n which my daughter was exposed. \n \n CHREMES \n \n apart. Syrus, what is the meaning of these expressions\n ? \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n Nurse, how is it? Does it not seem to you the same? \n \n \n NUR. \n As for me, I said it was the same the very instant that you showed it\n me. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n But have you now examined it thoroughly, my dear nurse? \n \n \n NUR. \n Thoroughly. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n Then go in-doors at once, and if she has now done bathing, bring me\n word. I'll wait here in the mean time for my husband. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n apart. She wants you, see what it is she wants; she is in\n a serious mood, I don't know why; it is not without a cause----I fear\n what it may be. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What it may be? I' faith, she'll now surely be announcing some important\n trifle, with a great parade. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n \n turning round. Ha! my husband! \n \n \n CHREMES \n Ha! my wife ! \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n I was looking for you. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Tell me what you want. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n In the first place, this I beg of you, not to believe that I have\n ventured to do any thing contrary to your commands. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Would you have me believe you in this, although so incredible? Well, I\n will believe you. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n aside. This excuse portends I know not what offense. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n Do you remember me being pregnant, and yourself declaring to me, most\n peremptorily, that if I should bring forth a girl, you would not have it\n brought up. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I know what you have done, you have brought it up. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n aside. Such is the fact, I'm sure: my young master has\n gained a loss \n in consequence. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n Not at all; but there was here an elderly woman of Corinth , of no indifferent character;\n to her I gave it to be exposed. \n \n \n CHREMES \n O Jupiter ! that there should be\n such extreme folly in a person's mind. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n Alas! what have I done ? \n \n \n CHREMES \n And do you ask the question? \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n If I have acted wrong, my dear Chremes, I have done so in ignorance. \n \n \n CHREMES \n This, indeed, I know for certain, even if you were to deny it, that in\n every thing you both speak and act ignorantly and foolishly: how many\n blunders you disclose in this single affair! For, in the first place,\n then, if you had been disposed to obey my orders, the child ought to\n have been dispatched; you ought not in words to have feigned her death,\n and in reality to have left hopes of her surviving. But that I pass\n over; compassion, maternal affection, I allow it. But how finely you did\n provide for the future! What was your meaning ? Do reflect. It's clear,\n beyond a doubt, that your daughter was betrayed by you to this old\n woman, either that through you she might make a living by her, or that\n she might be sold in open market as a slave. I suppose you reasoned\n thus: \" any thing is enough, if only her life is saved :\" what are you\n to do with those who understand neither law, nor right and justice? Be\n it for better or for worse, be it for them or against them, they see\n nothing except just what they please. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n My dear Chremes, I have done wrong, I own ; I am convinced. Now this I\n beg of you; inasmuch as you are more advanced in years than I, be so\n much the more ready to forgive; so that your justice may be some\n protection for my weakness. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I'll readily forgive you doing this, of course; but, Sostrata, my easy\n temper prompts you to do amiss. But, whatever this circumstance is, by\n reason of which this was begun upon, proceed to tell it. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n As we women are all foolishly and wretchedly superstitious, when I\n delivered the child to her to be exposed, I drew a ring from off my\n finger, and ordered her to expose it, together with the child; that if\n she should die, she might not be without some portion of our possessions. \n \n \n CHREMES \n That was right; thereby you proved the saving of yourself and\n her. \n \n \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n \n holding out the ring. This is that ring. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Whence did you get it? \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n From the young woman whom Bacchis brought here with her. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n aside. Ha! \n \n \n CHREMES \n What does she say? \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n She gave it me to keep for her, while she went to bathe. At first I paid\n no attention to it; but after I looked at it, I at once recognized it,\n and came running to you. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What do you suspect now, or have you discovered, relative to her ? \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n I don't know; unless you inquire of herself whence she got it, if that\n can possibly be discovered. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n aside. I'm undone! I see more hopes \n from this incident\n than I desire. If it is so, she certainly must be ours. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Is this woman living to whom you delivered the child? \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n I don't know. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What account did she bring you at the time? \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n That she had done as I had ordered her. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Tell me what is the woman's name, that she may be inquired after. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n Philtere. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n aside. 'Tis the very same. It's a wonder if she isn't\n found, and I lost. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Sostrata, follow me this way in-doors. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n How much beyond my hopes has this matter turned out! How dreadfully\n afraid I was, Chremes, that you would now be of feelings as unrelenting\n as formerly you were on exposing the child. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Many a time a man can not be \n such as he would be,\n if circumstances do not admit of it. Time has now so brought it about,\n that I should be glad of a daughter; formerly I wished for nothing less.\n CHREMES and SOSTRATA go into the house.) \n \n \n ",

For if you now go away from us, and leave\n Bacchis here, our old man will immediately come to know that she is\n Clitipho's mistress; if you take her away with you, it will be concealed\n just as much as it has been hitherto concealed. \n \n \n CLINIA \n But still, Syrus, nothing can make more against my marriage than this;\n for with what face am I to address my father about it? You understand\n what I mean ? \n \n \n SYRUS \n Why not ? \n \n \n CLINIA \n What can I say? What excuse can I make? \n \n \n SYRUS \n Nay, I don't want you to dissemble; tell him the whole case just as it\n really is. \n \n \n CLINIA \n What is it you say ? \n \n \n SYRUS \n I bid you do this; tell him that you are in love with her, and want her\n for a wife: that this Bacchis is Clitipho's mistress. \n \n \n CLINIA \n You require a thing that is fair and reasonable, and easy to be done.\n And I suppose, then, you would have me request my father to keep it a\n secret from your old man. \n \n \n SYRUS \n On the contrary; to tell him directly the matter just as it is. \n \n \n CLINIA \n What? Are you quite in your senses or sober? Why, you were for ruining\n him outright. For how could he be in a state of security ? Tell me\n that. \n \n \n SYRUS \n For my part, I yield the palm to this device. Here I do pride myself\n exultingly, in having in myself such exquisite resources, and power of\n address so great, as to deceive them both by telling the truth: so that\n when your old man tells ours that she is his son's mistress, he'll still\n not believe him. \n \n \n CLINIA \n But yet, by these means you again cut off all hopes of my marriage; for\n as long as Chremes believes that she is my mistress, he'll not give me\n his daughter. Perhaps you care little what becomes of me, so long as you\n provide for him. \n \n \n SYRUS \n What the plague, do you suppose I want this pretense to be kept up for\n an age ? 'Tis but for a single day, only till I have secured the money:\n you be quiet; I ask no more. \n \n \n CLINIA \n Is that sufficient? If his father should come to know of it, pray, what\n then? \n \n \n SYRUS \n What if I have recourse to those who say, \" What now if the sky were to\n fall?\" \n \n \n \n \n CLINIA \n I'm afraid to go about it. \n \n \n SYRUS \n You, afraid!

And you will not, of course, now be having\n recourse to this method; \"What have I to do with it? Was it lent to me?\n Did I give any orders? Had she the power to pawn my daughter without my\n consent?\" They quote that saying, Chremes, with good reason, \" Riorous\n law \n is often rigorous injustice.\" \n \n \n CHREMES \n I will not do so. \n \n \n SYRUS \n On the contrary, though others were at liberty, you are not at liberty;\n all think that you are in good and very easy circumstances. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Nay rather, I'll at once carry it to her myself. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Why no; request your son in preference. \n \n \n CHREMES \n For what reason? \n \n \n SYRUS \n Why, because the suspicion of being in love with her has been\n transferred to him with Menedemus. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What then? \n \n \n SYRUS \n Because it will seem to be more like probability when he gives it her;\n and at the same time I shall effect more easily what I wish.

For if I go on supplying\n his extravagance, Menedemus, in that case my circumstances will\n undoubtedly be soon reduced to the level of your rake. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n What evils you will bring upon yourself in this affair, if you don't act\n with caution! You'll show yourself severe, and still pardon him at last;\n that too with an ill grace. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Ah! you don't know how vexed I am. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Just as you please. What about that which I desire--that she may be\n married to my son? Unless there is any other step that you would\n prefer. \n \n \n CHREMES \n On the contrary, both the son-in-law and the connection are to my\n taste. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n What portion shall I say that you have named for your daughter? Why are\n you silent? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Portion? \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n I say so. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Alas! \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Chremes, don't be at all afraid to speak, if it is but a small one. The\n portion is no consideration at all with us. \n \n \n CHREMES \n I did think that two talents were sufficient, according to my means. But\n if you wish me to be saved, and my estate and my son, you must say to\n this effect, that I have settled all my property on her as her\n portion. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n What scheme are you upon? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Pretend that you wonder at this, and at the same time ask him the reason\n why I do so. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Why, really, I can't conceive the reason for your doing so. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Why do I do so? To check his feelings, which are now hurried away by\n luxury and wantonness, and to bring him down so as not to know which way\n to turn himself. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n What is your design? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Let me alone, and give me leave to have my own way in this matter. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n I do give you leave: is this your desire \n \n \n CHREMES \n It is so. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n Then be it so. \n \n \n CHREMES \n And now let your son prepare to fetch the bride. The other one shall be\n schooled in such language as befits children. But Syrus---- \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n What of him? \n \n \n CHREMES \n What? If I live, I will have him so handsomely dressed, so well combed\n out, that he shall always remember me as long as he lives; to imagine\n that I'm to be a laughing-stock and a plaything for him!

For what crime? What so great enormity have I, to my\n misfortune, committed? Young men generally do the same. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n I am aware that this must be much more harsh and severe to you, on whom\n it falls; but yet I take it no less amiss than you.

Enter CHREMES\n from his house. \n \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n See, here he is. MENEDEMUS goes into his house. \n \n \n \n CHREMES \n Why are you blaming me, Clitipho? Whatever I have done in this matter, I\n had a view to you and your imprudence. When I saw that you were of a\n careless disposition, and held the pleasures of the moment of the first\n importance, and did not look forward to the future, I took measures that\n you might neither want nor be able to waste this which I have. When,\n through your own conduct, it was not allowed me to give it you, to whom\n I ought before all, I had recourse to those who were your nearest\n relations; to them I have made over and intrusted every thing. \n There you'll always find a\n refuge for your folly; food, clothing, and a roof under which to betake\n yourself. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Ah me! \n \n \n CHREMES \n It is better than that, you being my heir, Bacchis should possess this\n estate of mine. \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n apart. I'm ruined irrevocably!--Of what mischief have I,\n wretch that I am, unthinkingly been the cause? \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Would I were dead! \n \n \n CHREMES \n Prithee, first learn what it is to live. When you know that, if life\n displeases you, then try the other. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Master, may I be allowed----? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Say on. \n \n \n SYRUS \n But may I safely? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Say on. \n \n \n SYRUS \n What injustice or what madness is this, that that in which I have\n offended, should be to his detriment? \n \n \n CHREMES \n It's all over. \n Don't\n you mix yourself up in it; no one accuses you, Syrus, nor need you look\n out for an altar, \n or for an intercessor for yourself. \n \n \n SYRUS \n What is your design? \n \n \n CHREMES \n I am not at all angry either with you, to SYRUS , or with\n you to CLITIPHO ; nor is it fair that you should be so\n with me for what I am doing.

He meditates. \n \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n What is it, then? \n \n \n SYRUS \n It is this--I think that you are not their son. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n How's that, Syrus? Are you quite in your senses? \n \n \n SYRUS \n I'll tell you what's come into my mind; be you the judge. While they had\n you alone, while they had no other source of joy more nearly to affect\n them, they indulged you, they lavished upon you. Now a daughter has been\n found, a pretense has been found in fact on which to turn you\n adrift. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n It's very probable. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Do you suppose that he is so angry on account of this fault? \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n I do not think so. \n \n \n SYRUS \n Now consider another thing. All mothers are wont to be advocates for\n their sons when in fault, and to aid them against a father's severity;\n 'tis not so here. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n You say true; what then shall I now do, Syrus? \n \n \n SYRUS \n Question them on this suspicion; mention the matter without reserve;\n either, if it is not true, you'll soon bring them both to compassion, or\n else you'll soon find out whose son you are. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n You give good advice; I'll do so. He goes into the house of\n CHREMES. \n \n \n \n SYRUS \n \n to himself. Most fortunately did this come into my mind.\n For the less hope the young man entertains, the greater the difficulty\n with which he'll bring his father to his own terms. I'm not sure even,\n that he may not take a wife, and then no thanks for Syrus. But what is\n this? The old man's coming out of doors; I'll be off. What has so far\n happened, I am surprised at, that he didn't order me to becarried off\n from here: now I'll away to Menedemus here, I'll secure him as my\n intercessor; I can put no trust in our old man.

I'm undone! \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n Do you hesitate, Clitipho? \n \n \n CHREMES \n Nay, just as he likes. \n \n \n MENEDEMUS \n He'll do it all. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n This course, while you are making a beginning, is disagreeable, and\n while you are unacquainted with it. When you have become acquainted with\n it, it will become easy. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n I'll do it, father. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n My son, upon my honor I'll give you that charming girl, whom you may\n soon become attached to, the daughter of our neighbor Phanocrata. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n What! that red-haired girl, with cat's eyes, freckled face, \n and hooked nose? I can not,\n father. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Heyday! how nice he is! You would fancy he had set his mind upon it. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n I'll name another. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Why no--since I must marry, I myself have one that I should pretty\n nearly make choice of. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n Now, son, I commend you. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n The daughter of Archonides here. \n \n \n SOSTRATA \n I'm quite agreeable. \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n Father, this now remains. \n \n \n CHREMES \n What is it? \n \n \n CLITIPHO \n I want you to pardon Syrus for what he has done for my sake. \n \n \n CHREMES \n Be it so. To the Audience. Fare you well, and grant us\n your applause. \n \n "
