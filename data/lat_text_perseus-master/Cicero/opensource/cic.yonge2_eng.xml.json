For the Gauls say so. We cannot deny it. If you\n      think this is the duty of an able and experienced and impartial judge, that he must without\n      the slightest hesitation believe a thing because the witnesses say it; then the Goddess of\n      Safety herself cannot protect the innocence of brave men.

The character that you know, from daily\n      experience, O judges, belongs to a flatterer of women, all agent of widows, an over-litigious\n      defender, eager for strife, ignorant and stupid among men, but a shrewd and clever lawyer\n      among women; this was the character of Aebutius.

I will here give my\n      public thanks to this witness for having shown himself merciful in his conduct, and\n      conscientious in giving his evidence.  Aulus Atilius and his\n      son Lucius Atilius stated that there were armed men there, and that they also brought their\n      slaves armed.

Besides these, two more witnesses gave\n      evidence, saying nothing about the violence, but speaking only of the original business and of\n      the purchase of the farm. There was Publius Caesennius, the seller of the farm, a man with a\n      body of greater weight than his character; and Sextus Clodius, a banker, whose surname is\n      Phormio, a man no less black and no less presuming than that Phormio in Terence: neither of\n      these said anything about violence, nor about anything else which had any reference to this\n      trial.

But though he came forward so eagerly and violently that he not only attacked Caecina\n      with his perjuries, but seemed to be angry with me also, I made him so tranquil and gentle\n      that he did not dare, as you recollect, to say a second time even how many miles his farm was\n      distant from the city. For when he had said that it was fifty-three miles  off, the people cried out with a laugh, that that was exactly the\n      distance. For all men recollected how much he had received on the trial of Albius.  What shall I say against him except that which he cannot\n      deny?that he came on the bench during a criminal trial, though he was not a member\n      of that tribunal; and that, while sitting on that bench, though he had not heard a word of the\n      cause, and though there was an opportunity of adjourning the decision, he still gave his\n      sentence,  that the case was proved; that as he chose to decide without\n      having inquired into the matter, he preferred condemning to acquitting; and that, inasmuch as,\n      if there had been one damnatory vote fewer, the defendant could not have been condemned, he\n      came forward, not so much for the purpose of investigating the case, as of insuring a\n      conviction. Can anything worse be said against any man, than that he was induced by a bribe to\n      condemn a man whom he had never seen nor even heard of? Or, can any allegation be made against\n      a man on more certain grounds than one which even he, against whom it is made, cannot attempt\n      to invalidate, not even by signs?

And if we say that those armies have been\n      routed by force, which have fled through fear, and often from only some slight suspicion of\n      danger; and if we have both seen and heard of troops being put to flight, not only by the dash\n      of shield against shield, nor by bodily conflict, nor by blows interchanged hand to hand, nor\n      by the showering of missile weapons from a distance, but often by the mere shout of the\n      soldiers, by their warlike array, and the sight of the hostile standards; shall that, which is\n      called violence in war, not be called violence in peace?

Shall a man who departs quietly find it\n      more easy to prove that violence has been offered to him, than a man who has fled from it?\n        But I say this. If, when first Aebutius told Caecina, when\n      in the castle, that he had collected men and armed them, and that, if he came thither, he\n      would never go away again, Caecina had at once departed, you ought not to have doubted whether\n      violence had been offered to Caecina.

Can you then say\n      that it was not violence which hindered him, when, by reason of armed men, he was unable to\n      come to a place, when he wished to come there, and had gone out with that intention?

Now, then, you cannot deny that violence was\n      offered. The question now is, how he was driven away who was prevented from approaching. For a\n      man who is driven away must manifestly be removed and thrust down from the place which he is\n      occupying. And how can that happen to a man who absolutely never was in the place at all from\n      which he says that he was driven? What shall we say? If he had been there, and if under the\n      influence of fear, he had fled from the place when he saw the armed men, would you then say\n      that he had been driven away? I think so. Will you then, who decide disputes with such care\n      and such subtlety, by expressions and not by equity,you who interpret laws, not by\n      the common advantage of the citizen, but by their letter,will you be able to say\n      that a man has been driven away who has never been touched? What! Will you say that he has\n      been thrust down from his place? For that was the word which the praetors used formerly to use\n      in their interdicts. What do you say? Can any one be thrust down who is not touched? Must we\n      not, if we will stick to the strict letter, understand that that man only is thrust down on\n      whom hands are laid? It is quite inevitable, I say, if we wish to make words and facts tally\n      exactly with each other, that no one should be decided to have been thrust down, unless he be\n      understood to have had hands laid on him, and so to have been removed and pushed headlong down\n      by personal violence. But how can any one have been treated so, unless he has been removed\n      from a higher place to a lower one? A man may have been\n      driven away, he may have been put to flight, he may have been cast out; but it is absolutely\n      impossible for any one to have been pushed down, not only who has never been touched, but who,\n      if he has been touched, has been touched on even and level ground.

Those men\n      are collected who are brought together by any one into one place; if they not only were never\n      invited, but if they did not even assemble on purpose at all; if there was no one there who\n      was not there previously, not for the purpose of committing violence? but because they were\n      used to be there for the sake of tilling the ground or tending the flocks.

I was driven away from the adjoining farm belonging to my neighbours, across which I was\n      going to that farm; I was driven away from the road; I was certainly driven away from some\n      place or other, from some ground, either private or public.

That is my defence; mine. I assert this loudly; I call all the\n      gods and men to witness, that, as our ancestors would allow no legal defence to be pleaded for\n      armed violence, the question before the court is not, where were the footsteps of the man who\n      was driven away, but what was the act of the man who drove him away; I say loudly, that the\n      man who was put to flight was driven away, that violence was offered to the man who was put in\n      danger of his life.  That topic you avoid and dread; and you\n      try to call me back from the wide field, if I may so say, of justice, to these narrow passes\n      of words, and to all the corners of letters. You shall yourself be hemmed in and caught in\n      those very toils which you try to oppose to me. I did not drive him away; I drove\n      him off. This seems to you a very clever idea.

If the praetor did not\n      clearly define the place in which he ordered me to be replaced, and merely ordered me to be\n      replaced, I have not been replaced according to his decree. \n      I wish, O judges, if all this appears to you to be a more cunning system of defence than I\n      usually adopt, that you would consider, first of all, that another originally devised it, and\n      not I; in the next place, that not only I was not the originator of the system, but that I do\n      not even approve of it, and that I did not bring it forward for the purposes of my own\n      defence, but that I used it as a reply to their defence; that I can speak in behalf of my own\n      rights, and that in this matter which I have brought forward, what ought to be inquired into\n      is not, in what terms the praetor framed his interdict, but what was the place intended when\n      he framed it, and that in a case of violence offered by armed: men, the thing to he inquired\n      into is not, where the violence was offered, but whether it was offered or not; and that you\n      cannot possibly urge in your defence, that where you wish it to be done, the words of the\n      interdict ought to be regarded but that where you do not wish it, they ought not to be\n      considered."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "87", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "88", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "31", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "89", "@unit": "section"}], "persName": {"surname": "Carbo"}, "#text": "But is any answer given to me with reference to that which I have already mentioned, that\n      this interdict was so framed, not only as to facts, and as to its meaning, but also as to its\n      expressions, that nothing appeared to require any alteration? Listen carefully, O judges, I\n      beseech you, for it becomes your wisdom to recognise, not my prudence, but that of our\n      ancestors; for I am not going to mention what I myself have discovered, but a thing which did\n      not escape their notice. When an interdict is issued respecting acts of violence, they were\n      aware that there are two descriptions of causes to which the interdict had reference: one, if\n      a man had been driven by violence from the place in which he was; the other, if he was driven\n      from the place to which he was coming; and either of these may take place, and nothing else\n      can, O judges.  Consider this then, if you please. If any\n      one has driven my household away from my farm, he has driven me too from that place. If any\n      one came up to me with armed men, outside my farm, and prevented me from entering, then he has\n      driven me, not out of that place, but from that place. For these two classes of actions they\n      invented one phrase which sufficiently expressed them both; so that, whether I had been driven\n      out of my farm, or from my farm, still I should be replaced by one and the same interdict,\n      containing the words from which you . . .  these words from\n      which comprehend either case: both out of which place, and from which place. Whence\n      was Cinna driven? Out of the city. Whence was \n      driven? From the city. Whence were the Gauls driven? From\n      the Capitol. Whence were they driven who were with Gracchus? Out of the Capitol. You see,\n      therefore, that by this one phrase two things are signified, both out of what place, and from\n      what place; and when the praetor orders me to be replaced in that place, he orders me to be so\n      on this understanding, just as if the Gauls had demanded of our ancestors to be replaced in\n      the situation from which they had been driven, and if by any force they had been able to\n      obtain it, it would not, I imagine, have been right for them to be replaced in the mine, by\n      which they had attacked the Capitol, but in the Capitol itself. For this is\n      understoodReplace him in the place from which you drove him\n      away, whether you drove him out of the place, or from the place. This now is plain\n      enough; replace him in that place; if you drove him out of this place, replace him in it; if\n      you drove him from this place, replace him in that place, not out of which, but from which he\n      was driven. Just as if a person at sea, when he had come near to his own country, were on a\n      sudden driven off by a storm, and were to wish, as he had been driven off from his country, to\n      be restored to his former position. What he would wish, I imagine, would be\n      this,that fortune would restore him to the place from which he had been driven; not\n      so as to replace him in the sea, but in the city which he was on his way to. So too, (since\n      now we are necessarily hunting out the meaning of words from the similarity of the\n      circumstances,) he who demands to be restored to the place from which he was\n      driven,that is to say, whence he was driven, demands to be restored to\n      that very place itself."}, {"persName": {"surname": "Piso"}, "milestone": {"@n": "90", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "As the words lead us to this conclusion, so too the case itself forces us to think and\n      understand the same thing.

And even that is not enough, unless he can show that he was in\n      possession, having become so neither by violence, nor by underhand practices, nor by having\n      begged the property. Therefore, he who said that he had replaced him is often accustomed to\n      avow loudly that he drove him away by violence; but he adds this, He was not in\n      possession. Or again, when he has admitted even this, still he gains his cause if\n      he can prove that the man had obtained possession from him either by violence, or by underhand\n      practices, or by begging for it.  Do you not perceive how\n      many defensive pleas our ancestors allowed a man to be able to employ who had done this\n      violence without arms and without a multitude? But as for the man who, neglecting right, and\n      duty, and proper customs, has betaken himself to the sword, to arms, and to murder, him you\n      see naked and defenceless in the cause; so that the man who has contended in arms for the\n      possession, must clearly contend unarmed in the court of justice. Is there, then, any real\n      difference, O , between these interdicts? Does it\n      make any difference whether the words As Aulus Caecina was in possession\n      be added, or not? Does the consideration of right,does the dissimilarity of the\n      interdicts,does the authority of your ancestors, at all influence you? If the\n      addition had been made, inquiry must have been made as to this point. The addition has not\n      been made. Must that inquiry still be instituted?

You do not deny that\n      Caesennia had a life interest in the farm. As the same farmer who rented it of Caesennia\n      continued to hold it on the same tenure, is there any doubt, that if Caesennia was the owner\n      while the farmer was tenant of the farm, so after her death her heir was the owner by the same\n      right? Afterwards Caecina, when he was going the round of his estates, came to that farm. He\n      received his accounts from the farmer. There is evidence to that point.  After that, why, O. Aebutius, did you give notice to Caecina to give up that\n      farm, rather than some others, if you could find any other, unless Caecina was in possession\n      of it? Moreover, why did Caecina consent to be ejected in a regular and formal manner? and why\n      did he make you the answer he did by the advice of his friends, and of Caius Aquillius\n      himself?"}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "96", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "97", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "98", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "34", "@unit": "chapter"}], "gap": {"@desc": "****"}, "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7006072", "#text": "Arretium"}, "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "decemvirs"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "decemvirs"}], "#text": "Oh, but Sulla passed a law.

You see that such an order is\n      worthless.  First of all, you allow this,that it does not follow\n      that whatever the people orders ought to be ratified. In the next place, you allege no reason\n      why, if liberty cannot possibly be taken away, citizenship may. For we have received our\n      traditions about each in the same way; and if citizenship can once be taken away, liberty\n      cannot be preserved. For how can a man be free by the rights of the Quirites, who is not\n      included in the number of the Quirites?  And I, when quite a\n      young man, established this principle when I was pleading against Cotta, the most eloquent man\n      of our city. When I was defending the liberty of a woman of , and when Cotta had suggested a scruple to the  that our action was not a regular one, because the rights of citizenship\n      had been taken from the Arretines, and when I argued rather vehemently that rights of\n      citizenship could not be taken away, at the first hearing the  gave no decision; afterwards, when they had inquired into, and\n      deliberated on, the subject, they decided that our action was quite regular.

There is not one of you who doubts this.  At\n      all events, I am well aware that this is frequently asked, (as I must remind you of those\n      things which do not occur to yourself,) how it is, if the right of citizenship cannot be taken\n      away, that our citizens have often gone to the Latin colonies.

But as men wished to\n      avoid imprisonment, execution, or infamy, which are penalties ,appointed by the laws, they\n      flee to banishment as to an altar, though, if they chose to remain in the city and to submit\n      to the rigour of the law, they would not lose their rights of citizenship sooner than they\n      lost their lives; but because they do not so choose, their rights of citizenship are not taken\n      from them, but are abandoned and laid aside by them.

And that all men may understand that I give\n      Lucius Lucullus all the praise that is due to a gallant man, and most wise  man, and to a most consummate general, I say that when he first\n      arrived in , the forces of Mithridates were most\n      numerous, well appointed, and provided with every requisite; and that the finest city in\n       , and the one, too, that was most friendly to\n      us, the city of , was besieged by the king\n      in person, with an enormous army, and that the siege had been pressed most vigorously, when\n      Lucius Lucullus, by his valour, and perseverance, and wisdom, relieved it from the most\n      extreme danger.  I say that he also, when general, defeated\n      and destroyed that great and well-appointed fleet, which the chiefs of Sertorius's party were\n      leading against  with furious zeal; I say\n      besides, that by him numerous armies of the enemy were destroyed in several battles, and that\n        was opened to our legions, which before his\n      time had been closed against the Roman people on every side; and that Sinope and , towns in which the king had palaces, adorned and\n      furnished with every kind of magnificence, and many other cities of  and ,\n      were taken by his mere approach and arrival near them; that the king himself was stripped of\n      the kingdom possessed by his father and his grandfather, and forced to betake himself as a\n      suppliant to other kings and other nations; and that all these great deeds were achieved\n      without any injury to the allies of the Roman people, or any diminution of its revenues. I\n      think that this is praise enough;such praise that you must see, O Romans, that\n      Lucius Lucullus has not been praised as much from this rostrum by any one of these men who are\n      objecting to this law and arguing against our cause."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7016619", "#text": "Pontus"}, {"@key": "tgn,7016619", "#text": "Pontus"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000004", "#text": "Asia"}, {"@key": "tgn,7006651", "#text": "Armenia"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "23", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "24", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "25", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "26", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "10", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Perhaps now it will be asked, how, when all this has been already done, there can be any\n      great war left behind. I will explain this, O Romans; for this does not seem an unreasonable\n      question. At first Mithridates fled from his kingdom, as Medea is formerly said to have fled\n      from the same region of ; for they say that\n      she, in her flight, strewed about the limbs of her brother in those places along which her\n      father was likely to pursue her, in order that the collection of them, dispersed as they were,\n      and the grief which would afflict his father, might delay the rapidity of his pursuit.\n      Mithridates, flying in the same manner, left in  the whole of the vast quantity of gold and silver, and of beautiful\n      things which he had inherited from his ancestors, and which he himself had collected and\n      brought into his own kingdom, having obtained them by plunder in the former war from all\n       . While our men were diligently occupied in\n      collecting all this, the king himself escaped out of their hands.  And so grief retarded the father of Medea in his pursuit, but delight\n      delayed our men. In this alarm and flight of his, Tigranes, the king of , received him, encouraged him while despairing of his\n      fortunes, gave him new spirit in his depression, and recruited with new strength his powerless\n      condition. And after Lucius Lucullus arrived in his kingdom, very many tribes were excited to\n      hostilities against our general. For those nations which the Roman people never had thought\n      either of attacking in war or tampering with, had been inspired with fear. There was, besides,\n      a general opinion which had taken deep root, and had spread over all the barbarian tribes in\n      those districts, that our army had been led into those countries with the object of plundering\n      a very wealthy and most religiously worshipped temple. And so, many powerful nations were\n      roused against us by a fresh dread and alarm. But our army although it had taken a city of\n      Tigranes's kingdom, and had fought some successful battles, still was out of spirits at its\n      immense distance from , and its separation from\n      its friends.  At present I will not say more; for the result\n      of these feelings of theirs was, that they were more anxious for a speedy return home than for\n      any further advance into the enemies' country. But Mithridates had by this time strengthened\n      his army by reinforcements of those men belonging to his own dominions who had assembled\n      together, and by large promiscuous forces belonging to many other kings and tribes. And we see\n      that this is almost invariably the case, that kings when in misfortune easily induce many to\n      pity and assist them, especially such as are either kings themselves, or who live under kingly\n      power, because to them the name of king appears something great and sacred.  And accordingly he, when conquered, was able to accomplish what, when he was\n      in the full enjoyment of his powers, he never dared even to wish for. For when he had returned\n      to his kingdom, he was not content (though that had happened to him beyond all his hopes) with\n      again setting his foot on that land after he had been expelled from it; but he even\n      volunteered an attack on your army, flushed as it was with glory and victory. Allow me, in\n      this place, O Romans, (just as poets do who write of Roman affairs,) to pass over our\n      disaster, which was so great that it came to Lucius Lucullus's ears, not by means of a\n      messenger despatched from the scene of action, but through the report of common conversation.\n        At the very time of this misfortune,of this\n      most terrible disaster in the whole war, Lucius Lucullus, who might have been able, to a great\n      extent, to remedy the calamity, being compelled by your orders, because you thought, according\n      to the old principle of your ancestors, that limits ought to be put to length of command,\n      discharged a part of his soldiers who had served their appointed time, and delivered over part\n      to Glabrio. I pass over many things designedly; but you yourselves can easily conjecture how\n      important you ought to consider that war which most powerful kings are uniting\n      in,which disturbed nations are renewing,which nations, whose strength is\n      unimpaired, are undertaking, and which anew general of yours has to encounter after a veteran\n      army has been defeated."}, "I appear to have said enough to make you see why this war is in its very nature unavoidable,\n      in its magnitude dangerous.

But now, when there is Cnaeus\n      Pompeius alone, who has exceeded in valour, not only the glory of these men who are now alive,\n      but even all recollections of antiquity, what is there that, in this case, can raise a doubt\n      in the mind of any one?

How universal should be their\n      affability! how brilliant their genius! how tender their humanity! And let us briefly consider\n      to what extent these qualities exist in Cnaeus Pompeius. For they are all of the highest\n      importance, O Romans, but yet they are to be seen and ascertained more by comparison with the\n      conduct of others than by any display which they make of themselves.  For how can we rank a man among generals of any class at all, if\n      centurionships  are sold, and have been constantly sold in his\n      army? What great or honourable thoughts can we suppose that that man cherishes concerning the\n      republic, who has either distributed the money which was taken from the treasury for the\n      conduct of the war among the magistrates, out of ambition  to keep\n      his province, or, out of avarice, has left it behind him at , invested for his own advantage?

Do we\n      wonder now that this man should be so far superior to all others, when his legions arrived in\n        in such order that not only no man's hand in so\n      numerous an army, but not even any man's footstep was said to have done the least injury to\n      any peaceful inhabitant?

No avarice turned him aside\n      from his intended route in pursuit of some plunder or other; no lust led him away in pursuit\n      of pleasure; no luxury allured him to seek its delights; the illustrious reputation of no city\n      tempted him to make its acquaintance; even labour did not turn him aside to seek rest.

Now, too, after the disaster which befell\n      us in , from the result of that battle, of\n      which, sorely against my will, I just now reminded you, when our allies were in a state of\n      alarm, when the power and spirits of our enemies had risen, and the province was in a very\n      insufficient state of defence, you would have entirely lost , O Romans, if the fortune of the Roman people had not, by some divine\n      interposition, brought Cnaeus Pompeius at that particular moment into those regions. His\n      arrival both checked Mithridates, elated with his unusual victory, and delayed Tigranes, who\n      was threatening  with a formidable army. And can\n      any one doubt what he will accomplish by his valour, when he did so much by his authority and\n      reputation? or how easily he will preserve our allies and our revenues by his power and his\n      army, when he defended them by the mere, terror of his name?"}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Metellus, afterwards called Creticus, from his victory over the Cretans."}, "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,1000095", "#text": "Spain"}, "milestone": {"@n": "47", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Come, now; what a great proof does this circumstance afford us of the influence of the same\n      man on the enemies of the Roman people, that all of them, living in countries so far distant\n      from us and from each other, surrendered themselves to him alone in so short a time? that the\n      ambassadors of the Cretans, though there was at the time a general  and an army\n      of ours in their island came almost to the end of the world to Cnaeus Pompeius, and said, all\n      the cities of the Cretans were willing to surrender themselves to him?

For my judgment is this, that very\n      often commands have been conferred upon, and armies have been entrusted to Maximus, to\n      Marcellus, to Scipio, to Marius, and to other great generals, not only on account of their\n      valour, but also on account of their good fortune.

As for me, all the zeal, and wisdom, and industry, and ability of\n      which I am possessed, all the influence which I have through the kindness shown for me by the\n      Roman people, and through my power as praetor, as also, through my reputation for authority,\n      good faith, and virtue, all of it I pledge to you and the Roman people, and devote to the\n      object of carrying this resolution.  And I call all the\n      gods, to witness, and especially those who preside over this place and temple, who see into\n      the minds of all those who apply themselves to affairs of state, that I am not doing this at\n      the request of any one, nor because I think to conciliate the favour of Cnaeus Pompeius by\n      taking this side, nor in order, through the greatness of any one else, to seek for myself\n      protection against dangers, or aids in the acquirement of honours; because, as for dangers, we\n      shall easily repel them, as a man ought to do, protected by our own innocence; and as for\n      honours, we shall not gain them by the favour of any men, nor by anything that happens in this\n      place, but by the same laborious course of life which I have hitherto adopted, if your\n      favourable inclination assists me.  Wherefore, whatever I\n      have undertaken in this cause, O Romans, I assure you that I have undertaken wholly for the\n      sake of the republic; and I am so far from thinking that I have gained by it the favour of any\n      influential man, that I know, on the other hand, that I have brought on myself many enmities,\n      some secret, some undisguised, which I never need have incurred, and which get will not be\n      mischievous to you. But I have considered that I, invested with my present honours, and loaded\n      with so many kindnesses from you, ought to prefer your inclination, and the dignity of the\n      republic, and the safety of our provinces and allies, to all considerations of my own private\n      interest."}]}}, {"@n": "Clu.", "front": {"head": "THE SPEECH OF M.

For Oppianicus had murdered Melinus, the former\n       husband of Sassia, the mother of Cluentius, and married her, and finding that if Cluentius\n       were dead his property would all come to his mother, endeavoured to poison him, but was\n       detected and convicted.

And,\n      therefore, I have determined to preserve the same division of the subject in my defence,\n      speaking separately to the question of unpopularity and to that of the accusation, in order\n      that every one may understand that I neither wish to evade any point by being silent with\n      respect to it, nor to make anything obscure by speaking of it.  But when I consider how much pains I must take with each branch of the question, one\n      divisionthat, namely, which is the proper subject of your inquiry, the question of\n      the fact of the poisoningappears to me a very short one, and one which is not\n      likely to give occasion to any great dispute. But with the other division, which, properly, is\n      almost entirely unconnected with the case, and which is better adapted to assemblies in a\n      state of seditious excitement, than to tranquil and orderly courts of justice, I shall, I can\n      easily see, have a great deal of difficulty in dealing, and a great deal of trouble.\n        But in all this embarrassment, O judges, this thing still\n      consoles me,that you have been accustomed to hear accusations under the idea that\n      you will afterwards hear their refutation from the advocate; that you are bound not to give\n      the defendant more advantages towards ensuring his acquittal, than his counsel can procure for\n      him by clearing him of the charges brought against him, and by proving his innocence in his\n      speech. But as regards the odium into which they seek to bring him, you ought to deliberate\n      together, considering not what is said by us, but what ought to be said. For while we are\n      dealing with the accusations, it is only the safety of Aulus Cluentius that is at stake; but\n      by the odium sought to be excited against him, the common safety of all men is imperilled.\n      Accordingly, we will treat one division of the case as men who are giving you information, and\n      the other division, as men who are addressing entreaties to you. In the first division we must\n      beg of you to give us your diligent attention; in the second, we must implore the protection\n      of your good faith. There is no one who can withstand the popular feeling when excited against\n      him without the assistance of you and of men like you.  As\n      far as I myself am concerned. I hardly know which way to turn. Shall I deny that there is any\n      ground for the disgraceful accusation, that the judges were corrupted at the\n      previous trial? Shall I deny that that matter has been agitated at assemblies of the people?\n      that it has been brought before the courts of justice? that it has been mentioned in the\n      senate? Can I eradicate that belief from men's minds? a belief so deeply implanted in\n      themso long established. It is out of the power of my abilities to do so. It is a\n      matter requiring your aid, O judges; it becomes you to come to the assistance of the innocence\n      of this man attacked by such a ruinous calumny, as you would in the case of a destructive fire\n      or of a general conflagration."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "6", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "3", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "7", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Indeed, as in some places truth appears to have but little foundation to rest upon, and but\n      little vigour, so in this place unpopularity arising on false grounds ought to be powerless.\n      Let it have sway in assemblies, but let it be overthrown in courts of justice; let it\n      influence the opinions and conversation of ignorant men, but let it be rejected by the\n      dispositions of the wise; let it make sudden and violent attacks, but when time for\n      examination is given, and when the facts are ascertained, let it die away.

In the second place, that a\n      previous examination into the matter had been made by the very same judges who afterwards\n      condemned him, with such a result that he could not possibly have been acquitted, not only by\n      them, but by any other imaginable tribunal. When I have demonstrated this, then I will prove\n      that point which I am aware is particularly indispensable, that that tribunal was indeed\n      tampered with, not by Cluentius, but by the party hostile to Cluentius; and I will enable you\n      to see clearly in the whole of that cause what the facts really werewhat mistake\n      gave rise toand what had its origin in the unpopularity undeservedly stirred up\n      against Cluentius.  The first point is this, from which it\n      may be clearly seen that Cluentius had the greatest reason to confide in the justice of his\n      cause, because he came down to accuse Albius relying on the most certain facts and\n      unimpeachable witnesses. While on this topic, it is necessary for me, O judges,: briefly to\n      explain the accusations of which Albius was convicted. I demand of you, O Oppianicus, to\n      believe that I speak unwillingly of the affair in which your father was implicated, because I\n      am compelled by considerations of good faith, and of my duty as counsel for the defence.

When he died, in the consulship of\n      Sulla and Pompeius,  he left this son, a boy fifteen years old, and a daughter grown up and of\n      marriageable age, who a short time after her father's death married Aulus Aurius Melinus, her\n      own cousin, a youth of the fairest possible reputation, as was then supposed, among his\n      countrymen, for honour and nobleness.

Presently, she began to get so furious in\n      her insane passion, she began to be so hurried away by her lust, that neither modesty, nor\n      chastity, nor piety, nor the disgrace to her family, nor the opinion of men, nor the\n      indignation of her son, nor the grief of her daughter, could recall her from her desires.\n        She seduced the mind of the young man, not yet matured by\n      wisdom and reason, with all those temptations with which that early age can be charmed and\n      allured. Her daughter, who was tormented not only with the common indignation which all women\n      feel at injuries of that sort from their husbands, but who also was unable to endure the\n      infamous prostitution of her mother, of which she did not think that she could even complain\n      to any one without committing a sin herself, wished the rest of the world to remain in\n      ignorance of this her terrible misfortune, and wasted away in grief and tears in the arms and\n      on the bosom of Cluentius, her most affectionate brother. \n      However, there is a sudden divorce, which appeared likely to be a consolation for all her\n      misfortunes. Cluentia departs from Melinus; not unwilling to be released from the infliction\n      of such injuries, yet not willing to lose her husband. But then that admirable and illustrious\n      mother of hers began openly to exult with joy, to triumph in her delight, victorious over her\n      daughter, not over her lust. Therefore she did not choose her reputation to be attacked any\n      longer by uncertain suspicions; she orders that genial bed, which two years before she had\n      decked for her daughter on her marriage, to be decked and prepared for herself in the very\n      same house, having driven and forced her daughter out of it.

Avilius gets well immediately. But Asinius in a\n      very short time is slain, being tempted out to some sand-pits outside the  gate, by the idea that he was being taken to some\n      villa.  And after he had been missed a day or two, and could\n      not be found in those places in which he was usually to be sought for, and as Oppianicus was\n      constantly saying in the forum at  that he\n      and his friends had lately witnessed his will, the freedmen of Asinius and some of his\n      friends, because it was notorious that on the last day that Asinius had been seen, Avilius had\n      been with him, and had been seen with him by many people, proceed against him, and bring him\n      before Quintus Manilius, who at that time was a triumvir.  And Avilius at once, without\n      any witness or any informer appearing against him, being agitated by the consciousness of his\n      recent wickedness, relates everything as I have now stated it, and confesses that Asinius had\n      been murdered by him according to the plan of Oppianicus. \n      Oppianicus, while lying concealed in his own house, is dragged out by Manilius; Avilius the\n      informer is produced on the other side to face him.

Accordingly he arranges the business with\n      Oppianicus; he receives a bribe from him; he abandons the cause after it was commended, and\n      when it was fully proved. And in this trial of Oppianicus the crime committed on Asinius was\n      proved by many witnesses, and also by the information of Avilius; in which, it was notorious\n      that Oppianicus's name was mentioned first among the agents; and yet you say that he was an\n      unfortunate and an innocent man, convicted by a corrupt tribunal."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Ancona", "#text": "Ancona"}, {"@key": "perseus,Larinum", "#text": "Larinum"}, {"@key": "perseus,Larinum", "#text": "Larinum"}, {"@key": "perseus,Larinum", "#text": "Larinum"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "41", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "42", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "43", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "decuriones"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "ordo decurionum"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "ordo"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "curia"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "decuriones"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "curiales"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "curia"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "senatus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Colonia"}], "placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, "#text": "The term in the original is\n        .

And as Oppianicus was aware of that, for it was no\n      secret, he plainly saw, that, if Habitus were dead, all his property would come to his mother;\n      and she might afterwards, when she had become richer, and had lost her son, be put out of the\n      way by him, with more profit, and with less danger.

And accordingly he now resolved to prepare destruction for Habitus by the agency of Caius\n      Fabricius, for Lucius had died. Habitus was at that time in delicate health; and he was\n      employing a physician of no great reputation, but a man of tried skill and honesty, by name\n      Cleophantus, whose slave, Diogenes, Fabricius began to tamper with, and to induce by promises\n      and bribes to give poison to Habitus.

His advice\n      was that Habitus should buy Diogenes of Cleophantus, in order that the matter might be more\n      easily proved by his information, or else be discovered to be false. Not to make a long story\n      of it, Diogenes is bought in a few days, (when many virtuous men had secretly been made aware\n      of it,) the poison, and the money sealed up, which was given for that purpose, is seized in\n      the hands of Scamander, a freedman of the Fabricii.

And\n      so I acted. I strove and contended by every possible means, I had recourse to every possible\n      expedient, to every imaginable excuse in the case, which I could think of; so as, at all\n      events, (though I am almost ashamed to say it,) no one could think that the cause had been\n      left without an advocate.  But, whatever excuse I tried to\n      put forth, the prosecutor immediately wrested out of my hands.

When I employed this argument in the\n      defence, which has always been considered a most honourable one to use in the causes of\n      freedmen, that Scamander was highly esteemed by his patron; he admitted that, but asked, Who\n      had any opinion of that patron himself?

And all through that trial, though we appeared to be defending Scamander, he\n      was the defendant only in name, but in reality, it was Oppianicus who was in peril, and who\n      was the object of the whole prosecution. Nor, indeed, was there any doubt about it, nor could\n      he disguise that that was the case. He was constantly present in court, constantly interfering\n      in the case; he was exerting all his zeal and all his influence. And lastly, which was of\n      great injury to our cause, he was sitting in that very place as if he were the defendant. The\n      eyes of all the judges were directed, not towards Scamander, but towards Oppianicus; his fear,\n      his agitation, his countenance betraying suspense and uncertainty, his constant change of\n      colour, made all those things, which were previously very suspicious, palpable and evident."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,2257061", "#text": "Cornelian"}, "persName": {"surname": "Junius"}, "#text": "When the judges were about to come to their decision, Caius Junius, the president, asked the\n      defendant, according to the provisions of the  law which then existed, whether he wished the decision to be come to\n      in his case secretly or openly.

Read the statements of the witnesses. Tell me, in those\n      trials, what was objected to them, I will not say as an accusation, but even as a reproach,\n      except this poison of Oppianicus.  Many reasons can be\n      alleged why it was necessary that this decision should be given; but I will meet your\n      expectation half-way, O judges. For although I am listened to by you in such a way, that I am\n      persuaded no one was ever listened to more kindly or more attentively, still your silent\n      expectation has been for some time calling me in another direction, and seeming to chide me\n      thus:What then? Do you deny that that sentence was procured by\n      corruption? I do not deny that, but I say that the corruption was not practiced by\n      my client. By whom, then, was it practiced? I think, in the first place, if it had been\n      uncertain what was likely to be the result of that trial, that still it would have been more\n      probable that he would have recourse to corruption, who was afraid of being himself convicted,\n      than he who was only afraid of another man being acquitted. In the second place, as it was\n      doubtful to no one what decision must inevitably be given, that he would employ such means,\n      who for any reason distrusted his case, rather than he who had every possible reason to feel\n      confidence in his. Lastly, that at all events, he who had twice failed before those judges\n      must have been the corrupter, rather than he who had twice established his case to their\n      satisfaction.  One thing is quite certain. No one will be so\n      unjust to Cluentius, as not to grant to me, if it be proved that that tribunal was bribed,\n      that it was bribed either by Habitus or by Oppianicus. If I prove that it was not bribed by\n      Habitus, I prove that it was by Oppianicus,I clear Habitus. Wherefore, although I\n      have already established plainly enough that the one had no reason whatever for having\n      recourse to bribery, (and from this alone it follows that the bribery must have been committed\n      by Oppianicus,) still you shall have separate proofs of this particular point."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "65", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "66", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "And I will adduce those facts as arguments which, however, are very weighty\n      onesnamely, that he was the briber, who was in danger,that he was the\n      briber, who was afraid,that he was the briber, who had no hope of safety by any\n      other means; he who was always a man of extraordinary audacity.

And, therefore, as he saw that Oppianicus was in a desperate way,\n      and overwhelmed by two previous investigations adverse to him, he raised him up from his\n      depression with his promises, and bade him not despair of safety.

Therefore, says he,\n      the praetor was hostile to Junius on this account, because the tribunal was thought\n      to have been bribed by his means. Was then the whole cause changed at this time? Is\n      the case different, is the principle of that decision different, is the nature of the whole\n      business different now from what it was then? I do not think that of all the things that were\n      done then anything can be altered.  What, then, is the\n      reason why our defence is listened to with such silence now, but that all opportunity of\n      defending himself was refused to Junius then? Because at that time there was nothing in the\n      cause but envy, mistake, suspicion, daily assemblies, seditiously stirred up by appeals to\n      popular feeling. The same tribune of the people was the accuser before the assemblies, and the\n      prosecutor in the courts of law. Be came into the court of justice not from the, assembly, but\n      bringing the whole assembly with him. Those steps of ,  which were new at that time, appeared as if\n      they had been built on purpose for a theatre for the display of that tribunal. And when the\n      prosecutor had filled them with men in a state of great excitement, there was not only no\n      opportunity of speaking in favour of the defendant, but none of even rising up to speak.\n        It happened lately, before Caius Orchinius, my colleague,\n      that the judges refused to sanction a prosecution against Faustus Sulla, in a cause concerning\n      some money which remained unpaid. Not because they considered that Sulla was an outlaw, or\n      because they thought the cause of the public money insignificant or contemptible; but because,\n      when a tribune of the people was the accuser, they did not think that there could be a fair\n      trial. What? Shall I compare Sulla with ? or\n      this tribune of the people with Quinctius? or one time with the other time? Sulla, with his\n      great wealth, his numerous relations, connections, friends, and clients; but in the case of\n       all these things were small, and\n      insignificant, and collected and acquired by his own exertions. The one a tribune of the\n      people, moderate, modest, not only not seditious himself, but an enemy to seditious men; the\n      other bitter, fond of raking up accusations, a hunter after popularity, and a turbulent man.\n      The present a tranquil and a peaceable time; the former time one ruffled with every imaginable\n      storm of ill-will. And as all this was the case, still in the case of Faustus those judges\n      decided that a defendant was brought before the court on very unfair terms, when his adversary\n      was in possession of the greatest power known to the state, which he could avail himself of to\n      add force to his accusations."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "96", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "97", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "36", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "98", "@unit": "section"}], "persName": {"surname": "Junius"}, "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7016683", "#text": "Illyricum"}, "#text": "And this principle you, O judges, ought, as your wisdom and humanity prompts and enables you\n      to do, to consider over in your mind carefully; and to be thoroughly aware what disaster and\n      what danger the tribunitian power can bring upon every one individual among us, especially\n      when it is egged on by party spirit, and by assemblies of the people, stirred up in a\n      seditious manner. In the very best times, forsooth, when men defended themselves, not by\n      boastings addressed to the populace, but by their own worth and innocence, still neither\n      Publius Popillius, nor Quintus Metellus, most illustrious and most honourable men, could\n      withstand the power of the tribunes; much less at the present time, with such manners as we\n      now have, and such magistrates, can we possibly be saved without the aid of your wisdom, and\n      without the relief which is afforded by the courts of justice.  That court of justice then, O judges, was not like a court of justice; for\n      in it there was no moderation preserved, no regard was had to custom and usage, nor was the\n      cause of the defendant properly advocated. It was all violence, and, as I have said before, a\n      sort of earthquake or tempest,it was anything rather than a court of justice, or a\n      legal discussion, or a judicial investigation. But if there be any one who thinks that that\n      was a regular proceeding, and who thinks it right to adhere to the decision that was then\n      delivered; still he ought to separate this cause from that one. For it is said that a great\n      many things were demanded of him either because he had not taken the oath to observe the law,\n      or because he had not cast lots for electing judges in the room of those to whom objection had\n      been made in a legal manner. But the case of Cluentius can in no particular be connected with\n      these, laws, in accordance with which a penalty was sought to be recovered from .  Oh, but Bulbus also\n      was condemned. Add that he was condemned of treason, in order that you may understand that\n      this trial has no connection with that one. But this charge was brought against him. I confess\n      it; but it was also made evident by the letters of Caius Cosconius and by the evidence of many\n      witnesses, that a legion in  had been\n      tampered with by him; and that charge was one peculiarly belonging to that sort of\n      investigation, and was one which was comprehended under the law of treason. But this was an\n      exceedingly great disadvantage to him. That is mere guess work; and if we may have recourse to\n      that, take care, I beg you, that my conjecture be not far the more accurate of the two. For my\n      opinion is, that Bulbus, because he was a worthless, base, dishonest man, and because he came\n      before the court contaminated with many crimes of the deepest dye, was on that account the\n      more easily condemned. But you, out of Bulbus's whole case, select that which seems to suit\n      your own purpose, in order that you may say that it was that which influenced the judges."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "99", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "100", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "101", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "102", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "37", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "103", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Therefore, this decision in the case of Bulbus ought not to be any greater injury to this\n      cause, than those two which were mentioned by the prosecutor in the case of Publius Popillius\n      and Titus Gutta, who were prosecuted for corruption,who were accused by men who had\n      themselves been convicted of bribery, and whom I do not imagine to have been restored to their\n      original position merely because they had proved that these other men also had taken money for\n      the purpose of influencing their decision, or because they proved to the judges that they had\n      detected others in the same sort of offence of which they had themselves been guilty; and\n      that, therefore, they were entitled to the rewards offered by the law. Therefore, I think that\n      no one can doubt that that conviction for bribery can in no possible way be connected with the\n      cause of Cluentius and with your decision.  What! not if\n      Stalenus was condemned? I do not say at this present moment, O judges, that which I am not\n      sure ought to be said at all, that he was convicted of treason,I do not read over\n      to you the testimonies of most honourable men, which were given against Stalenus by men who\n      were lieutenants, and prefects, and military tribunes, under Mamercus Aemilius, that most\n      illustrious man, by whose evidence it was made quite plain that it was chiefly through his\n      instrumentality, when he was quaestor, that a seditious spirit was stirred up in the army. I\n      do not even read to you that evidence which was given concerning these six hundred thousand\n      sesterces, which when he had received on presences connected with the trial of Safinius, he\n      retained and embezzled as he did afterwards in the case of the trial of Oppianicus. I say nothing of all these things, and of many others which were\n      stated against Stalenus at that trial. This I do say,that Publius and Lucius\n      Cominius, Roman knights, most honourable and eloquent men, had the same dispute with Stalenus\n      then, whom they were accusing, that I now have with Attius. The Cominii said the same thing\n      that I say now,that Stalenus received money from Oppianicus to induce him to\n      corrupt the tribunal, and Stalenus said that he had received it to conciliate good-will\n      towards him.  This conciliation of good-will was laughed\n      at, and so was this assumption of the character of a good man, as in the gilded statues which\n      he erected in front of the temple of Juturna, at the bottom of which he had the following\n      inscription engraved,that the kings had been restored by him to the\n      favour of the people. All his frauds and dishonest tricks were brought under\n      discussion; his whole life, which has been spent in such a way as that, was laid open; his\n      domestic poverty, the profits which he made in the courts of law, were all brought to light:\n      an interpreter of peace and concord who regulated everything by the bribes which he received\n      was not approved of. Therefore, Stalenus was condemned at that time, while he urged the same\n      defence as Attius did.  When the Cominii did the same thing\n      that I have done throughout the whole of this cause, people approved of them. Wherefore, if by\n      the condemnation of Stalenus it was decided that Oppianicus had desired to corrupt the\n      judges,that Oppianicus had given one of the judges money to purchase the votes of\n      the other judges, (since it has been already settled that either Cluentius is guilty of that\n      offence, or else Oppianicus, but that no trace whatever is found of any money belonging to\n      Cluentius having been ever given to any judge, while money belonging to Oppianicus was taken\n      away, after the trial was over, from a judge,)can it be doubtful that that\n      conviction of Stalenus does not only not make against Cluentius, but is the greatest possible\n      confirmation of our cause and of our defence?"}, {"persName": [{"surname": "Junius"}, {"surname": "Junius"}, {"surname": "Junius"}], "#text": "Therefore, I see now that the case respecting the decision of  is of this nature, that I think it ought to be called an inroad of\n      sedition, an instance of the violence of the multitude, an outrage on the part of a tribune,\n      any thing rather than a judicial proceeding.

At least you think that the decision was\n      not a corrupt one. But he had condemned him; but he had not heard the entire case; but he had\n      been greatly and repeatedly annoyed at every assembly of the people, by Lucius Quinctius. Then\n      the whole of Quinctius's judicial conduct was unjust, deceitful, fraudulent, turbulent,\n      dictated by a wish for popularity, seditious. Be it so; Falcula may have been innocent. Well\n      then, some one condemned Oppianicus without being paid for it;  did not appoint men as judges in the place of the others, to condemn him\n      for a bribe. It is possible that there may have been some one who did not sit as judge from\n      the beginning, and who, nevertheless, condemned Oppianicus without having been bribed to do\n      so. But if Falcula was innocent, I wish to know who was guilty? If he condemned him without\n      being bribed to do so, who was bribed? I say that there has been nothing imputed to any one of\n      these men which was not imputed to Fidiculanius; I say that there was nothing in the case of\n      Fidiculanius which did not also exist in the case of the rest.  You must either find fault with this trial, the prosecution in which\n      appeared to rely on previous decisions, or else, if you admit that this was an honest one, you\n      must allow that Oppianicus was condemned without money having been paid to procure his\n      condemnation. Although it ought to be proof enough for any one, that no one out of so many\n      judges was proceeded against after Falcula had been acquitted.For why do you bring\n      up men convicted of bribery under a different law, the charges being well proved, the\n      witnesses being numerous? when, in the first place, these very men ought to be accused of\n      peculation rather than of bribery. For if, in trials for bribery, this was an hindrance to\n      them, that they were being prosecuted under a different law, at all events it would have been\n      a much greater injury to them to be brought before the court according to the law properly\n      belonging to this offence.  In the second place, if the\n      weight attached to this accusation was so great, that, under whatever law any one of those\n      judges was prosecuted, he must be utterly ruined; then why, when there: are such crowds of\n      accusers, and when the reward is so great, were not the others prosecuted too? On this, that\n      case is mentioned, (which, however, has no right to be called a trial,) that an action for\n      damages was brought against Publius Septimius Scaevola on that account; and what the practice\n      is in cases of that sort, as I am speaking before men of the greatest learning, I have no need\n      to occupy much time in explaining. For the diligence which is usually displayed in other\n      trials, is never exercised after the defendant has been convicted.  In actions for damages, the judges usually, either because they think that a\n      man whom they have once convicted is hostile to them, if any mention of a capital charge\n      against him is made, do not allow it; or else, because they think that their duties are over\n      when they have given their decision respecting the defendant, they attend more carelessly to\n      the other points. Therefore, very many men are acquitted of treason, when, if they were\n      condemned, actions would be brought to recover damages on charges of peculation. And we see\n      this happen every day,that when a defendant has been convicted of peculation, the\n      judges acquit those men to whom, in fixing the damages, it has been settled that the money has\n      come; and when this is the case, the decisions are not rescinded, but this principle is laid\n      down, that the assessment of damages is not a judicial trial.

Now, first I will lay down this general principle, that this city has never been\n      so content with censorial animadversions as with judicial decisions. Nor in so notorious a\n      case need I waste time by citing instances. I will just adduce this one fact,that\n      Caius Geta, after he had been expelled the senate by Lucius Metellus and Cnaeus Domitius when\n      they were censors, was himself appointed censor afterwards; and that he whose morals had met\n      with this reproof from the censors, was afterwards appointed to judge of the morals of the\n      whole Roman people, and of those very men who had thus punished him. But if that had been\n      thought a final judicial decision, (as other men when they have been condemned by a sentence\n      involving infamy are deprived for ever of all honour and all dignity, so) a man branded with\n      this ignominy would never have had any subsequent access to honour, or any possibility of\n      return to the senate.  Now, if the freedman of Cnaeus\n      Lentulus or of Lucius Gellius should convict any man of theft, he, being deprived of all his\n      credit, will never recover any portion of his honourable position in the city; but those men,\n      whom Lucius Gellius himself and Cnaeus Lentulus, the two censors, most illustrious citizens\n      and most wise men, have animadverted on, and, in their reasons for their sentences, have\n      imputed to them theft and peculation, have not only returned to the senate, but have been\n      acquitted of those very charges by judicial sentence."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "121", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "122", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "44", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "123", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "Aerarii"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "aes militare"}], "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7013962", "#text": "Rome"}, "#text": "were\n       those citizens of  who did not enjoy the perfect\n       franchise.

Wherefore, in every law in which exception has been made of\n      causes for which a magistrate may not be taken, or a judge elected, or another man accused,\n      this cause of ignominy is passed over. For their intention was that the power of the censors\n      should strike the profligate with terror, but not that it should have power over their lives.\n        Therefore, O judges, I will not only prove what you are\n      already aware of, that the censorial animadversions, and the reasons given for them too, have\n      often been overturned by the votes of the Roman people, but that they have also been upset by\n      the judicial sentences of those men who, being on their oaths, were bound to give their\n      decisions with more scrupulousness and care. In the first place, O judges, in the case of many\n      defendants, whom the censors in their notes accused of having taken money contrary to the\n      laws, they were guided by their own conscientious judgment, rather than by the opinion\n      expressed by the censors. In the second place, the city praetors, who are bound by their oaths\n      to select only the most virtuous men to be judges, have never thought that the fact of a man's\n      having been branded with ignominy by the censors was any impediment to their making him a\n      judge.  And lastly, the censors themselves have very often\n      not adhered to the decisions, if you insist on their being called decisions, of former\n      censors. And even the censors themselves consider their own decisions to be of only so much\n      weight, that one is not afraid to find fault with, or even to rescind the sentence of the\n      other; so that one decides on removing a man from the senate, the other wishes to have him\n      retained in it, and thinks him worthy of the highest rank. The one orders him to be degraded\n      to the rank of an aerarian  or to be entirely\n      disfranchised; the other forbids it. So that how can it occur to you to call those judicial\n      decisions which you see constantly rescinded by the Roman people, repudiated by judges on\n      their oaths, disregarded by the magistrates, altered by those who have the same power\n      subsequently conferred on them, and in which you see that the colleagues themselves repeatedly\n      disagree?"}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "bibl": {"@n": "Liv. 29.37.1", "#text": "twenty-ninth book of Livy, c. 37"}, "#text": "In\n       the , an extraordinary instance\n       is related of disagreement between the censors; for one of them, Caius Claudius Nero,\n       degraded his colleague, Marcus Livius, and Livius in his turn degraded Caius Claudius."}, "milestone": [{"@n": "124", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "125", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "45", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "126", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "And as all this is the case, let us see what the censors are said to have decided respecting\n      that corrupt tribunal.

If it is the case because they have so stated it, take\n      care what you are doing; beware lest you are establishing for the future a king by power in\n      the person of every one of our censors,beware lest the note \n      of a censor may hereafter be able to cause as much distress to the citizens as that terrible\n      proscription did,beware lest we have reason to dread for the future that pen of the\n      censor, whose point our ancestors blunted by many remedies, as much as that sword of the\n      dictator.

But how can it be fitting for the censors to act on this principle in the\n      distribution of dignities, in their judgment on the character of citizens, and in their\n      punishment of their vices? For a soldier who has not maintained his post, who has been afraid\n      of the vigorous attack of the enemy, may still hereafter become a better soldier, and a\n      virtuous man, and a useful citizen. Wherefore, to prevent his committing offences in time of\n      war through fear of the enemy, the great fear of death and execution was established by our\n      ancestors; but yet, that the number of those who underwent capital punishment might not be too\n      great, that plan of drawing lots was invented.

Of that man's\n      inconstancy and feebleness I will not say another word. This very will which you are reading\n      is such, that he, when he was disinheriting that son whom he hated, was joining with his other\n      son whom he loved, the most perfect strangers as his coheirs.

For all those speeches are\n      speeches of the cause, and of the occasion, and are not the speeches of the men or of the\n      advocates themselves. For if the causes themselves could speak for themselves, no one would\n      employ an orator. But, as it is, we are employed, in order to say, not things which are to be\n      considered as asserted on our own authority, but things which are derived from the\n      circumstances of the cause itself.  They say that that able\n      man, Marcus Antonius, was accustomed to say, that he had never written a speech, in\n      order that, if at any time he had said anything which was not desirable, he might be able to\n      deny that he had said it. Just as if whatever were said or pleaded by us was not\n      retained in men's memories, if we did not ourselves commit it to writing."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7008368", "#text": "Narbo"}, {"@key": "perseus,Privernum", "#text": "Privernum"}, {"@key": "perseus,Privernum", "#text": "Privernum"}, {"@key": "tgn,1031727", "#text": "Alban"}, {"@key": "perseus,Tibur", "#text": "Tibur"}, {"@key": "perseus,Tibur", "#text": "Tibur"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "141", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "142", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "52", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "143", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "But I, with respect to speeches of that sort, am guided by the authority of many men, and\n      especially of that most eloquent and most wise man, Lucius Crassus; whowhen he was\n      defending Lucius Plancius, whom Marcus Brutus, a man both vehement and able as a speaker, was\n      prosecuting; when Brutus, having set two men to read, made them read alternate chapters out of\n      two speeches of his, entirely contrary to one another, because when he was arguing against\n      that motion which was introduced against the colony of , he disparaged the authority of the senate as much as he could, but when\n      he was urging the adoption of the Servilian law, he extolled the senate with the most\n      excessive praises; and when he had read out of that oration many things which had been spoken\n      with some harshness against the Roman knights, in order to inflame the minds of those judges\n      against Crassusis said to have been a good deal agitated.  And so, in making his reply, he first of all explained the difference\n      between the two times, so that the speech might appear to have arisen from the case and from\n      its circumstances; after that, in order that Brutus might learn what a man, not only eloquent\n      but endued with the greatest wit and facetiousness, he had provoked, he himself in his turn\n      brought up three readers with a book a piece, all which books Marcus Brutus, the father of the\n      prosecutor, had left, on the civil law. When the first lines of them were read, those which I\n      take to be known to all of you, It happened by chance that I and Brutus my son were\n      in the country near , he\n      asked what had become of his farm at .\n      I and Brutus my son were in the district of Alba.

For you very often said that you had been informed that I intended to\n      defend this action, relying on the protection of the law. Is it so?

For when this cause was\n      brought to me, as to a person who ought to know the laws on which we are employed, and to\n      which we devote ourselves, I said at once to Habitus that he was perfectly safe from the law\n      about those who conspired together to procure a man's condemnation; but\n      that our order was liable to be impeached under that law. And he began to beg and entreat me\n      not to defend him by urging points of law.

I\n      complied with his wishes, and yet I did it (for it is not a thing which we ought to do at all\n      times) because I saw that the cause itself could be amply defended on its own merits, without\n      any reference to law at all. I saw that in this defence, which I now have employed, there was\n      more dignity, but that in that one which he begged me not to use, there would be less trouble.\n      But if I had no other object in view beyond merely gaining this cause, I should have read the\n      laws to you, and then have summed up."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "146", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "147", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "148", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "54", "@unit": "chapter"}], "persName": {"surname": "Naso"}, "#text": "Nor am I moved by that argument which Attius uses when he says that it is a scandalous thing\n      that, if a senator should procure a wrongful conviction of any one, he should be made liable\n      to the laws, but that if a Roman knight does the same, he should not.  Although I should grant to you that it would be a scandalous thing, (and the\n      fact I will examine into presently,) still you must inevitably grant to me that it is a much\n      more scandalous thing that the laws should be departed from in that state which is entirely\n      held together by the laws; for this is the bond of this dignity which we enjoy in the\n      republic, this is the foundation of our liberty, this is the source of justice.

If anyone, O Titus Attius, were to wish to\n      prosecute you before me as judge, you would cry out that you were not liable under the law\n      about extortion.

To\n      make inquiry with respect to whom? The subject is interminable. Whoever has made\n      it, or sold it, or bought it, or had it in his possession, or administered it. What\n      does the same law subjoin immediately afterwards? ReadAnd bring him to a\n      capital trial. Whom? He who has conspired? he who has agreed? Not so. What, then,\n      is meant? Tell me. Whoever is a military tribune of the four first legions, or a\n      quaestor, or a tribune of the people. Then all the magistrates are named.\n      Or who has delivered or shall deliver his opinion in the senate? What\n      then? If any one of them has agreed, or shall agree, has conspired, or shall\n      conspire, to get any one condemned in a criminal trial. Any one of\n      them: Of whom? Of those, forsooth, who have been enumerated above. What does it\n      signify in which way the law was framed? Although it is plain enough, yet the law itself shows\n      its own meaning; for when it binds all the world, it uses this expression: Whoever\n      has committed or shall commit an act of poisoning. All men and women, freemen and\n      slaves, are brought under the power of the court. If, again, it had wished to include\n      conspiracy, it would have added, or who has conspired.

Does that apply to Cluentius? Certainly\n      not. Who, then, is Cluentius? He is a man who still does not wish to get off on a trial by any\n      quibble of law. Well, then, I discard the law.

He thinks it is for his interest that his defence\n      should rest on the facts and merits of the case, not on the letter of the law; but I think\n      that it concerns me not to appear defeated by Attius in any discussion. For this is not the\n      only cause that I have to plead; my labour is at the service of every one who can be content\n      with my ability as their advocate. I do not wish any one of those who are present to think, if\n      I remain silent, that I approve of what has been said by Attius respecting the law. Wherefore,\n      O Cluentius, I am complying with your wishes in this your cause; and I do not read any law in\n      this court, nor do I allege any law in your favour.

In the first place, (suppose I do grant to you that it is a most scandalous\n      thing,) it is an evil of this sort, that it is a proof that we have need to have the laws\n      altered, not that we are not to obey the laws while they are in existence. In the next place,\n      what senator has ever made this complaint, that when, by the kindness of the Roman people, he\n      had attained a higher rank, he did not think he ought by that promotion to be put under more\n      severe conditions of law? How many advantages are there, which we are without; how many\n      troubles and annoyances are there which we undergo.And all these things are\n      compensated by the advantages of honour and dignity. Now apply these same conditions of life\n      to the equestrian order, and to the other ranks of the state. They will not endure them; for\n      they think that fewer inconveniences of the laws, and of the courts of justice, ought to be\n      allotted to them, who have either never been able to mount to the higher ranks of the state,\n      or have never tried.

But those who wish to engross all power\n      to themselves, and to prevent any from existing in any other man, or in any other rank, think\n      that by holding this single fear over them, they will be able to bring the Roman knights under\n      their power, if it is once established that investigations of this sort can be held upon those\n      men who have acted as judges. For they see that the authority of this order is strengthened,\n      they see that its judicial decisions are approved; but if this fear be suspended over you they\n      feel confident that they shall be able to pluck the sting out of your severity.

You have said, when a relation of Publius Aelius had been\n      disinherited by his will, this man, who was no relation of his, was declared his\n      heir. Publius Aelius acted so from his knowledge of Habitus's merit. He was not\n      present at the making of the will, and that will was signed by Oppianicus as a witness.

That is not the case; but as thirty sesterces had been written instead of\n      three hundred, and as it did not appear to him to have been very carefully worded, he only\n      wished him to consider what he received as due to his liberality. He first denied that the\n      money was legally due, but, having done so, he then paid it without any dispute.

And what reason had he for being so\n      exceedingly afraid of Oppianicus, when he could not possibly say a word in this case, and\n      while accusers could not possibly be wanting, as long as his mother was alive? which you will\n      soon have proved to you.

You say that Oppianicus was killed by poison,\n      which was administered to him in bread by some one of the name of Marcus Asellius, an intimate\n      friend of his own; and that that was done by the contrivance of Habitus. Now, in this matter,\n      I ask first of all what reason Habitus had for wishing to kill Oppianicus.

Now, by fear of\n      what could Habitus have been influenced, that he should have endeavoured to commit so great a\n      crime? What reason could any one have had for fearing Oppianicus, already condemned to\n      punishment for his crimes, and banished from the city? What did Cluentius fear? Did he fear\n      being attacked by a ruined man? or being accused by a convict? or being injured by the\n      evidence of an exile? But if, because Habitus hated him, he, on that account, did not wish him\n      to live, was he such a fool, as to think that a life which he was then living, the existence\n      of a convict, of an exile, of a man abandoned by every one? whom, on account of his odious\n      disposition, no one was willing to admit into his house, or to visit, or to speak to, or even\n      to look at?  Did Habitus, then, envy the life of this men?\n      If he had hated him bitterly and utterly, ought he not to have wished him to live as long as\n      possible? Would an enemy have hastened his death, when death was the only refuge which he had\n      left from his calamity? If the man had had any virtue or any courage, he would have killed\n      himself, (as many brave men have done in many instances, when in similar misfortunes.) How is\n      it possible for an enemy to have wished to offer to him what he must himself have wished for\n      eagerly For now indeed, what evil has death brought him? Unless, perchance, we are influenced\n      by fables and nonsense, to think that he is enduring in the shades below the punishments of'\n      the wicked, and that he has met with more enemies there than he left behind here; and that he\n      has been driven headlong into the district and habitation of wicked spirits by the avenging\n      furies of his mother-in-law, of his wife, of his brother, and of his children. But if these\n      stories are false, as all men are well aware that they are, what else has death taken from him\n      except the sense of his misery?

On this I ask, on what account the framer of this law has commenced his law and his\n       measures in such a manner, as to deprive the Roman people of its right of voting?

I ask this tribune of the people, who is so attached to the people, whether\n       they were ever created except by the whole thirty-five tribes? In truth, as it is proper for\n       every power, and every command, and every charge which is committed to any one, to proceed\n       from the entire Roman people, so especially ought those to do so, which are established for\n       any use and advantage of the Roman people; as that is a case in which they all together\n       choose the man who they think will most study the advantage of the Roman people, and in which\n       also each individual among them by his own zeal and his own vote assists to make a road by\n       which he may obtain some individual benefit for himself. This is the tribune to whom it has\n       occurred above all others to deprive the Roman people of their suffrages, and to invite a few\n       tribes not by any fixed condition of law, but by the kindness of lots drawn, and by chance,\n       to usurp the liberties belonging to all.  Also\n       in the same manner, it says in the second clause, as in the comitia for\n       the election of a Pontifex Maximus. He did not perceive even this, that our\n       ancestors did really study the good of the people so much, that, though it was not lawful for\n       that office to be conferred by the people, on account of the religious ceremonies then used,\n       still, they chose, in order to do additional honour to the priesthood, that the sanction of\n       the people should be asked for it. And Cnaeus Domitius, a tribune of the people, and a most\n       eminent man, passed the same law with respect to the other priesthoods; enacting, because the\n       people, on account of the requirements of religion, could not confer the priesthoods, that a\n       small half of the people should be invited; and that whoever was selected by that half should\n       be chosen into their body by the sacred college.  See now\n       how great a difference there is between Cnaeus Domitius, a tribune of the people, a man of\n       the highest rank, and Publius Rullus, who tried your patience, as I imagine, when he said\n       that he was a noble. Domitius contrived a way by which, as far as he was able, as far as was\n       consistent with the laws of men and of gods, he might confer on a portion of the people what\n       could not be done by any regular proceeding on the part of the entire people. But this man,\n       when there was a thing which had always belonged to the people, which no one had ever\n       impaired, and which no one had ever altered,the principle, namely, that those who\n       were to assign lands to the people, should receive a kindness from the Roman people before\n       they conferred one on it; that this man has endeavoured entirely to take away from you, and\n       to wrest out of your hands.

For he orders the man who has passed the law to hold\n       the comitia for the creation of the decemvirs. I will state the case more plainly. Rullus, as\n       a man far from being covetous or ambitious, orders Rullus to hold the comitia. I do not find\n       fault yet. I see that others have done the same thing. Now see what is the object of this,\n       which no one else ever did, with respect to the smaller half of the people. He will hold the\n       comitia; he wishes to have the appointment of those officers for whom kingly power is sought\n       to be procured by this law. He himself will not entrust it to the entire people, nor do those\n       who were the original instigators of these designs think it ought to be entrusted to them.\n         The same Rullus will cast lots between the tribes. He,\n       happy man, will pick out the tribes which he prefers.

But as for the other six-and-twenty tribes, there will be nothing which\n       they will not think that they have a right to refuse them. Who are they, then, whom he means\n       to have elected tribunes? In the first place, himself. How can that be lawful? For there are\n       old laws, and those too not laws made by consuls, if you think that that makes any\n       difference, but made by tribunes, very pleasing and agreeable to you and to your ancestors.\n       There is the Licinian law, and the second Aebutian law; which excepts not only the man who\n       has caused a law to be passed concerning any commission or power, but also all his colleagues\n       and all his connections, and incapacitates them from being appointed to any power or\n       commission so established.  In truth, if you consult the\n       interests of the people, remove yourself from all suspicion of any advantage to yourself;\n       allow the power to accrue to others, gratitude for the good you have done must be enough for\n       yourself.

All this land, at whatever price it is purchased, will be returned to you at a\n       great price. There is another sort of landsuncultivated on account of their\n       barrenness, desolate and deserted on account of the unhealthiness of the\n       situationwhich will be bought of those men, who see that they must abandon them if\n       they do not sell them.

Manners are not implanted in men so much by the blood and family, as by those things\n       which are supplied by the nature of the plan towards forming habits of life, by which we are\n       nourished, and by which we live. The Carthaginians, a fraudulent and lying nation, were\n       tempted to a fondness for deceiving by a desire of gain, not by their blood, but by the\n       character of their situation because, owing to the number of their harbours, they had\n       frequent intercourse with merchants and foreigners. The Ligurians, being mountaineers, are a\n       hardy and rustic tribe. The land itself taught them to be so by producing nothing which was\n       not extracted from it by skillful cultivation, and by great labour. The Campanians were\n       always proud from the excellence of their soil, and the magnitude of their crops, and the\n       healthiness, and position, and beauty of their city. From that abundance, and from this\n       affluence in all things, in the first place, originated those qualities; arrogance, which\n       demanded of our ancestors that one of the consuls should be chosen from : and in the second place, that luxury which conquered\n       Hannibal himself by pleasure, who up to that time had proved invincible in arms.  When those decemvirs shall, in accordance with the law of Rullus,\n       have led six hundred colonists to that place; when they shall have established there a\n       hundred decurions, ten augurs, and six priests, what do you suppose their courage, and\n       violence, and ferocity will be then? They will laugh at and despise , situated among mountains and valleys, stuck up, as it\n       were, and raised aloft, amid garrets, with not very good roads, and with very narrow streets,\n       in comparison with their own , stretched out\n       along a most open plain, and in comparison of their own beautiful thoroughfares. And as for\n       the lands, they will not think the  or\n       Pupinian district fit to be compared at all to their fertile and luxuriant plains. And all\n       the abundance of neigbouring towns which surround us they will compare in laughter and scorn\n       with their neighbours. They will compare ,\n       Fidenae, Collatia,even \n       itself, and , and , with , and Teanum, and , and\n        , and , and , and Nuceria.\n         By all these things they will be elated and puffed up,\n       perhaps not at once, but certainly when they have got a little more age and vigour they will\n       not be able to restrain themselves; they will go on further and further. A single individual,\n       unless he be a man of great wisdom, can scarcely, when placed in situations of great wealth\n       or power, contain himself within the limits of propriety; much less will those colonists,\n       sought out and selected by Rullus, and others like Rullus, when established at , in that abode of pride, and in the very home of\n       luxury, refrain from immediately contracting some wickedness and iniquity. Yes, and it will\n       be much more the case with them, than with the old genuine Campanians, because they were born\n       and trained up in a fortune which was theirs of old, but were depraved by a too great\n       abundance of everything; but these men, being transferred from the most extreme indigence to\n       a corresponding affluence, will be affected, not only by the extent of their riches, but also\n       by the strangeness of them."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Capua", "#text": "Capua"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "99", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "100", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "You, O Publius Rullus, have chosen to follow in the footsteps of Marcus Brutus's\n       wickedness, rather than to be guided by the monuments of the wisdom of our ancestors.

But still a man from whom\n       any property is taken always has some hope arising from those laws; and he, to whom any is\n       given, has some scruples. The provision in Rullus's law is, Whatever has been done\n       since the consulship of Caius Marius and Cnaeus Papirius. How carefully does he\n       avoid suspicion, when he names those consuls most especially who were the greatest\n       adversaries of Sulla. For, if he had named Sulla, he thought that that would have been a\n       palpable and also an invidious measure.

By whom,\n       O Rullus? Who has allotted anything whatever since the Consulship of Marius and Carbo? Who\n       has given anything, who has granted anything, except Sulla? Let all those things\n       remain in the same condition. In what condition? He is undermining something or\n       other. This over active and too energetic tribune of the people is rescinding the acts of\n       Sulla. As those things which have become private property according to the most\n       regular possible course of law. Are they then to be held on a surer tenure than a\n       man's paternal and hereditary property?  Just so. But the\n       Valerian law does not say this; the  laws\n       do not sanction this; Sulla himself does not demand this. If those lands have any connection\n       with legal right, if they have any resemblance to private property, if they have the least\n       hope of becoming permanent property, then there is not one of those men so impudent as not to\n       think that he is excellently well treated. But you, O Rullus, what is your object? That they\n       may retain what they have got? Who hinders them? That they may retain it as private property?\n       But the law is framed in such a way that the farm of your father-in-law in the Hirpine\n       district, or the whole Hirpine district, for he is in possession of all of it, is held by him\n       on a surer tenure than my paternal hereditary estate at Arpinum. For that is the effect of\n       the provision of your law.  For those farms in truth are\n       held by the best right, which are held on the best conditions. Free tenures are held by a\n       better tenure than servile ones. By this clause all tenures which have hitherto been servile\n        \n       tenures will be so no longer. Enfranchised estates are in a better condition than those which\n       are liable to no obligations; by the same clause all lands subject to the payment of any\n       fine, if only they were assigned by Sulla, are released from such payments. Lands which are\n       exempt from payment are in a better condition than those which pay a fine. I, in my Tusculan\n       villa, must pay a tax for the Crabran  water, because I received my estate subject to this\n       liability; but, if I had only had the land given me by Sulla, I should not pay it, according\n       to the law of Rullus."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "11", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "12", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "13", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "4", "@unit": "chapter"}], "persName": {"surname": "Carbo"}, "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,2257061", "#text": "Cornelian"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7006667", "#text": "Macedonia"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000004", "#text": "Asia"}], "pb": {"@n": "262"}, "#text": "I see you, O Romans, moved either by the impudence of the law or of the speech, as indeed\n       you must be from the nature of the case; by the impudence of the law, which gives a better\n       title to estates possessed by virtue of Sulla's donation than to hereditary property; by the\n       impudence of the speech which, in such a cause is that, dares to accuse any one, and yet\n       vehemently, too vehemently, to defend the principles of Sulla.

I ask\n      you yourself; I say, O Labienus,when the consuls, in pursuance of the resolution of\n      the senate, had summoned the citizens to arms; when Marcus Aemilius, the chief of the senate,\n      stood in arms in the assembly; who, though he could scarcely walk, thought the lameness of his\n      feet not an impediment to his pursuit of enemies, but only to his flight from them; when,\n      lastly, Quintus Scaevola, worn out as he was with old age, enfeebled by disease, lame, and\n      crippled, and powerless in all his limbs, leaning on his spear, displayed at the same time the\n      vigour of his mind and the weakness of his body; when Lucius Metellus, Sergius Galba, Caius\n      Serranus, Publius Rutilius, Caius Fimbria, Quintus Catulus, and all the men of consular rank\n      who were then in existence, had taken arms in defence of the common safety; when all the\n      praetors, all the nobles and youth of the city, united together, Cnaeus and Lucius Domitius,\n      Lucius Crassus, Quintus Mucius, Caius Claudius, Marcus Drusus; when all the Octavii, Metelli,\n      Julii, Cassii, Catos and ; when Lucius\n      Philippus, Lucius Scipio, when Marcus Lepidus, when Decimus Brutus, when this very man\n      himself; Servilius, under whom you, O Labienus, have served as your general; when this Quintus\n      Catulus, whom we see here, then a very young man; when this Caius Curio; when, in short, every\n      illustrious man in the city was with the consuls;what then did it become Caius\n      Rabirius to do?

Terentia interrupted their deliberations by coming in to inform them of a\n        prodigy which had just happened that after the sacrifice in which she had been engaged was\n        over the fire revived spontaneously; on which the vestal virgins had sent her to him to\n        inform him of it, and to bid him pursue what he was then thinking of and intending for the\n        good of his country, since the goddess had given this sign that she was watching over his\n        safety and glory.", "The next day the senate ordered public rewards to the ambassadors and to Vulturcius; and\n        showed signs of intending to proceed with extreme rigour against the conspirators when on a\n        sudden rumours arose of plots having been formed by the slaves of Lentulus and Cethegus for\n        their masters' rescue; which obliged Cicero to double all the guards, and determined him to\n        prevent any repetition of such attempts by bringing before the senate without delay the\n        question of the punishment of the prisoners. On which account he summoned the senate to meet\n        the next morning.", "There were many difficulties in the matter. Capital punishments were unusual and very\n        unpopular at Rome. And there was an old law of Porcius Lecca, a tribune of the people, which\n        granted to all criminals who were capitally condemned an appeal to the people; and also a\n        law had been passed, since his time, by Caius Gracchus, to prohibit the taking away the life\n        of any citizen without a formal hearing before the people. And these considerations had so\n        much weight with some of the senators, that they absented themselves from the senate during\n        this debate, in order to have no share in sentencing prisoners of such high rank to death.\n        The debate was opened by Silanus, the consul elect, who declared his opinion that those in\n        custody, and those also who should be taken subsequently, should all be put to death.\n        Everyone who followed him agreed with him, till Julius Caesar, the praetor elect, (who has\n        been often suspected of having at least to some extent, privy to the conspiracy,) rose, and\n        in an elaborate speech proposed that they should not be put to death, but that their estates\n        should be confiscated, and they themselves kept in perpetual confinement. Cato opposed him\n        with great earnestness. But some of Cicero's friends appeared inclined to Caesar's motion,\n        thinking it a safer measure for Cicero himself; but when Cicero perceived this, he rose\n        himself; and discussed the opinions both of Silanus and Caesar in the following speech,\n        which decided the senate to vote for their condemnation. And as soon as the vote had passed,\n        Cicero went immediately from the senate house, took Lentulus from the custody of his kinsman\n        Lentulus Spinther, and delivered him to the executioner. The other conspirators, Cethegus,\n        Statilius, Gabinius, were in like manner conducted to execution by the praetors; and Cicero\n        was conducted home to his house in triumph by the whole body of the senate and by the\n        knights, the whole multitude following him, and saluting him as their deliverer."]}, "milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "1", "@unit": "section"}], "p": ["I see, O conscript fathers, that the looks and eyes of you all are turned towards me; I see\n       that you are anxious not only for your own danger and that of the republic, but even, if that\n       be removed, for mine.

For, to say nothing of Servius\n      Sulpicius, who, I am aware, is influenced not by any wrong done by Lucius Murena, but only by\n      the party spirit engendered by the contest for honour, his father's friend, Cnaeus Postumius,\n      is his accuser, an old neighbour and intimate friend of his own, as he says himself; who has\n      mentioned many reasons for his intimacy with him, while he has not been able to mention one\n      for any enmity towards him.

Let not all the\n      honours of Marcus Cato, which he has acquired in order to be able to assist many men, be an\n      injury to my client alone. Publius Africanus had been twice consul, and had destroyed those\n      two terrors of this empire, Carthage and Numantia, when he prosecuted Lucius Cotta. He was a\n      man of the most splendid eloquence, of the greatest good faith, of the purest integrity; his\n      authority was as great almost as that of the Roman people itself, in that empire which had\n      been mainly saved by his means. I have often heard old men say that this very extraordinarily\n      high character of the accuser was of the greatest service to Lucius Cotta. Those wise men who\n      then were the judges in that cause, did not like any one to be defeated in a trial, if he was\n      to appear overwhelmed only by the excessive influence of his adversary.  What more shall I say? Did not the Roman people deliver Sergius Galba (the\n      fact is preserved in the recollection of every one) from your grandfather, that most intrepid\n      and prosperous man, Marcus Cato, who was zealously seeking his ruin? At all times in this city\n      the whole people, and also the judges, wise men, looking far into futurity, have resisted the\n      overweening power of prosecutors. I do not like an accuser bringing his personal power, or any\n      predominant influence, or his own eminent authority, or his own excessive popularity, into a\n      court of justice. Let all these things have weight to ensure the safety of the innocent, to\n      aid the weak, to succour the unfortunate.

For if perchance any one\n      should say that Cato would not have come forward as an accuser if he had not previously made\n      up his mind about the justice of the cause, he will then be laying down a most unjust law, O\n      judges, and establishing a miserable condition for men in their danger, if he thinks that the\n      opinion of an accuser is to have against a defendant the weight of a previous investigation\n      legally conducted."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "61", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "30", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "62", "@unit": "section"}], "pb": {"@n": "360"}, "#text": "I, O Cato, do not venture to find fault with your intentions, by reason of my\n      extraordinarily high opinion of your virtue; but in some particulars I may perhaps be able\n      slightly to amend and reform them.

For nature has herself formed you for honesty, and gravity, and moderation, and\n      magnanimity, and justice; and for all the virtues required to make a great and noble man. To\n      all these qualities are added an education not moderate, nor mild, but as it seems to me, a\n      little harsh and severe, more so than either truth or nature would permit.  And since we are not to address this speech either to an ignorant multitude,\n      or to any assembly of rustics, I will speak a little boldly about the pursuits of educated\n      men, which are both well known and agreeable to you, O judges, and to me.

The qualities which we sometimes wish for in\n      him, are not all those which are implanted in a man by nature, but some of them are such as\n      are derived from education. For there was once a man of the greatest genius, whose name was\n      Zeno, the imitators of whose example are called Stoics. His opinions and precepts are of this\n      sort: that a wise man is never influenced by interest; never pardons any man's fault; that no\n      one is merciful except a fool and a trifler; that it is not the part of a man to be moved or\n      pacified by entreaties; that wise men, let them be ever so deformed, are  the\n      only beautiful men; if they be ever such beggars, they are the only rich men; if they be in\n      slavery, they are kings. And as for all of us who are not wise men, they call away slaves,\n      exiles, enemies, lunatics. They say that all offenses are equal; that every sin is an\n      unpardonable crime; and that he does not commit a less crime who kills a cock if there was no\n      need to do so, than the man who strangles his father.

You will be a wicked and infamous man if you do anything from\n      being influenced by mercy. Does any one confess that he has done wrong, and beg\n      pardon for his wrong doing? To pardon is a crime of the deepest\n      dye.But it is a trifling offence. All\n      offences are equal. You say something. That is a fixed and unalterable\n      principle.

I might\n      say the same of Lucius Philus, and of Caius Gallus; but I will conduct you now into your own\n      house. Do you think that there was any man more courteous, more agreeable; any one whose\n      conduct was more completely regulated by every principle of virtue and politeness, than Cato,\n      your great-grandfather?

You will see that their opinion and mine has been one and the same about this\n      man's case, and about that of the others. Who of us stood by Varguntius? No one. Not even this\n      Quintus Hortensius, the very man who had formerly been his only defender when prosecuted for\n      corruption. For he did not think himself connected by any bond of duty with that man, when he,\n      by the commission of such enormous wickedness, had broken asunder the ties of all duties\n      whatever. Who of us countenanced Servius Sulla? who ? who of us thought\n      Marcus Laeca or Caius Cornelius fit to be defended? who of all the men whom you see here gave\n      the countenance of his presence to any one of those criminals?  No one. Why was that? Because in other causes good men think that they ought not to refuse\n      to defend even guilty men, if they are their own intimate personal friends; but in this\n      prosecution, there would not only be the fault of acting lightly, but there would be even some\n      infection of wickedness which would taint one who defended that man whom he suspected of being\n      involved in the guilt of planning the parricide of his country.  What was the case of Autronius? did not his companions, did not his own\n      colleagues, did not his former friends, of whom he had at one time an ample number, did not\n      all these men, who are the chief men in the republic, abandon him? Yes, and many of them even\n      damaged him with their evidence. They made up their minds that it was an offence of such\n      enormity, that they not only were bound to abstain from doing anything to conceal it, but that\n      it was their duty to reveal it, and throw all the light that they were able upon it."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "8", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "9", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "10", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "4", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "11", "@unit": "section"}], "pb": {"@n": "378"}, "#text": "What reason is there then for your wondering, if you see me countenancing this cause in\n      company with those men, whom you know that I also joined in discountenancing the other causes\n      by absenting myself from them. Unless you wish me to be considered a man of eminent ferocity\n      before all other men, a man savage, inhuman, and endowed with an extraordinary cruelty and\n      barbarity of disposition.  If this be the character which, on\n      account of all my exploits, you wish now to fix upon my whole life, O Torquatus, you are\n      greatly mistaken. Nature made me merciful, my country made me severe; but neither my country\n      nor nature has ever required me to be cruel. Lastly, that same vehement and fierce character\n      which at that time the occasion and the republic imposed upon me, my own inclination and\n      nature itself has now relieved me of; for my country required severity for a short time, my\n      nature requires clemency and lenity during my whole life. \n      There is, therefore, no pretence for your separating me from so numerous a company of most\n      honourable men. Duty is a plain thing, and the cause of all men is one and the same. You will\n      have no reason to marvel hereafter, whenever you see me on the same side as you observe these\n      men. For there is no side in the republic in which I have a peculiar and exclusive property.\n      The time for acting did belong more peculiarly to me than to the others but the cause of\n      indignation, and fear, and danger was common to us all. Nor, indeed, could I have been at that\n      time as I was the chief man in providing for the safety of the state if others had been\n      unwilling to be my companions. Wherefore it is inevitable that that which, when I was consul,\n      belonged to me especially above all other men, should, now that I am a private individual,\n      belong to me in common with the rest. Nor do I say this for the sake of sharing my\n      unpopularity with others, but rather with the object of allowing them to partake of my\n      praises. I will give a share of my burden to no one;  but a share of my glory to\n      all good men.  You gave evidence against\n      Autronius, says he, and you are defending Sulla. All this, O\n      judges, has this object to prove that if I am an inconstant and fickle-minded man, my evidence\n      ought not to be credited, and my defence ought not to carry any authority with it. But if\n      there is found in me a proper consideration for the republic, a scrupulous regard to my duty,\n      and a constant desire to retain the good-will of virtuous men, then there is nothing which an\n      accuser ought less to say than that Sulla is defended by me, but that Autronius was injured by\n      my evidence against him. For I think that I not only carry with me zeal in defending causes,\n      but also that my deliberate opinion has some weight; which, however, I will use with\n      moderation, O judges, and I would not have used it at all if he had not compelled me."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "12", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "13", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "5", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "14", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Two conspiracies are spoken of by you, O Torquatus; one, which is said to have been formed\n      in the consulship of Lepidus and Volcatius, when your own father was consul elect; the other,\n      that which broke out in my consulship. In each of these you say that Sulla was implicated. You\n      know that I was not acquainted with the counsels of your father, a most brave man, and a most\n      excellent consul. You know, as there was the greatest intimacy between you and me, that I knew\n      nothing of what happened, or of what was said in those times; I imagine, because I had not yet\n      become a thoroughly public character, because I had not yet arrived at the goal of honour\n      which I proposed to myself; and because my ambition and my forensic labours separated me from\n      all political deliberations.  Who, then, was present at your\n      counsels? All these men whom you see here, giving Sulla the countenance of their presence; and\n      among the first was Quintus Hortensiuswho, by reason of his honour and worth, and\n      his admirable disposition towards the republic, and because of his exceeding intimacy with and\n      excessive attachment to your father, was greatly moved by the thoughts of the common danger,\n      and most especially by the personal peril of your father. Therefore, he was defended from the\n      charge of being implicated in that conspiracy by that man who was present at and acquainted\n      with all your deliberations, who was a partner in all your thoughts and in all your fears;\n      and, elegant and argumentative as his speech in repelling this accusation was, it carried with\n      it as much authority as it displayed of ability. Of that conspiracy, therefore, which is said\n      to have been formed against you, to have been reported to you, and to have been revealed by\n      you, I was unable to say anything as a witness. For I not only found out nothing, but scarcely\n      did any report or suspicion of that matter reach my ears. \n      They who were your counselors, who became acquainted with these things in your\n      company,they who were supposed to be themselves menaced with that danger, who gave\n      no countenance to Autronius, who gave most important evidence against him,are now\n      defending Publius Sulla, are countenancing him by their presence here; now that he is in\n      danger they declare that they were not deterred by the accusation of conspiracy from\n      countenancing the others, but by the guilt of the men. But for the time of my consulship, and\n      with respect to the charge of the greatest conspiracy, Sulla shall be defended by me. And this\n      partition of the cause between Hortensius and me has not been made by chance, or at random, O\n      judges, but as we saw that we were employed as defenders of a man against those accusations in\n      which we might have been witnesses, each of us thought that it would be best for him to\n      undertake that part of the case, concerning which he himself had been able to acquire some\n      knowledge, and to form some opinions with certainty."}, "And since you have listened attentively to Hortensius, while speaking on the charge\n      respecting the former conspiracy, now, I beg you, listen to this first statement of mine\n      respecting the conspiracy which was formed in my consulship.", {"milestone": [{"@n": "15", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "16", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "17", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "6", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "18", "@unit": "section"}], "pb": {"@n": "380"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "fasces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "falces"}], "#text": "Some commentators propose  instead\n       of  here, and it would certainly make much better\n       sense."}, "#text": "When I was consul I heard many reports, I made many inquiries, I learnt a great many\n      circumstances concerning the extreme peril of the republic.

Perhaps this\n      assertion ought to have great weight when coming from a man who as consul had investigated the\n      plots laid against the republic with prudence, had revealed them with sincerity had chastised\n      them with magnanimity and who says that he himself never heard a word against Publius Sulla\n      and never entertained a suspicion of him. But I do not as yet employ this assertion for the\n      purpose of defending him I rather use it with a view to clear myself in order that Torquatus\n      may cease to wonder that I, who would not appear by the side of Autronius, am now defending\n      Sulla.  For what was the cause of Autronius? and what is the\n      cause of Sulla? The  former tried to disturb and get rid of a prosecution for\n      bribery by raising in the first instance a sedition among gladiators and runaway slaves, and\n      after that as we all saw, by stoning people, and collecting a violent mob. Sulla, if his own\n      modesty and worth could not avail him, sought no other assistance. The former, when he had\n      been convicted, behaved in such a manner, not only in his secret designs and conversation, but\n      in every look and in his whole countenance, as to appear an enemy to the most honourable\n      orders in the state, hostile to every virtuous man, and a foe to his country. The latter\n      considered himself so bowed down, so broken down by that misfortune, that he thought that none\n      of his former dignity was left to him, except what he could retain by his present moderation.\n        And in this conspiracy, what union was ever so close as\n      that between Autronius and Catiline, between Autronius and Lentulus? What combination was\n      there ever between any men for the most virtuous purposes, so intimate as his connection with\n      them for deeds of wickedness, lust and audacity?what crime is there which Lentulus\n      did not plot with Autronius?what atrocity did Catiline ever commit without his\n      assistance? while, in the meantime, Sulla not only abstained from seeking the concealment of\n      night and solitude in their company, but he had never the very slightest intercourse with\n      them, either in conversation or in casual meetings.  The\n      Allobroges, those who gave us the truest information on the most important matters, accused\n      Autronius, and so did the letters of many men, and many private witnesses. All that time no\n      one ever accused Sulla; no one ever mentioned his name. Lastly, after Catiline had been driven\n      out or allowed to depart out of the city, Autronius sent him arms, trumpets, bugles, scythes,\n        standards, legions. He who was left in the city, but expected out of it though\n      checked by the punishment of Lentulus, gave way at times to feelings of fear, but never to any\n      right feelings or good sense. Sulla, on the other hand, was so quiet, that all that time he\n      was at Naples, where it is not supposed that there were any men who were implicated in or\n      suspected of this crime; and the place itself is one not so well calculated to excite the\n      feelings of men in distress, as to console them."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "19", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "20", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "7", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "21", "@unit": "section"}], "pb": {"@n": "382"}, "#text": "On account, therefore, of this great dissimilarity between the men and the cases, I also\n      behaved in a different manner to them both.

He used to enumerate many services which I had done him, and some also\n      which he had done me. By all which circumstances, O judges, I was so much swayed and\n      influenced, that I banished from my recollection all the plots which he had laid against me\n      myself; that I forgot that Caius Cornelius had been lately sent by him for the purpose of\n      killing me in my own house, in the sight of my wife and children. And if he had formed these\n      designs against me alone, such is my softness and lenity of disposition, that I should never\n      have been able to resist his tears and entreaties;  but when\n      the thoughts of my country, of your dangers, of this city, of all those shrines and temples\n      which we see around us, of the infant children, and matrons, and virgins of the city occurred\n      to me, and when those hostile and fatal torches destined for the entire conflagration of the\n      whole city, when the arms which had been collected, when the slaughter and blood of the\n      citizens, when the ashes of my country began to present themselves to my eyes, and to excite\n      my feelings by the recollection, then I resisted him, then I resisted not only that enemy of\n      his country, that parricide himself, but I withstood also his relations the Marcelli, father\n      and son, one of whom was regarded by me with the respect due to a parent, and the other with\n      the affection which one feels towards a son. And I thought that I could not, without being\n      guilty of the very greatest wickedness, defend in their companion the same crimes which I had\n      chastised in the case of others, when I knew him to be guilty.  And, on the same principle, I could not endure to see Publius Sulla coming\n      to me as a suppliant, or these same Marcelli in tears at his danger nor could I resist the\n      entreaties of Marcus Messala, whom you see in court, a most intimate friend of my own. For\n      neither was his cause disagreeable to my natural disposition nor had the man or the facts\n      anything in them at variance with my feelings of clemency his name had never been mentioned,\n      there was no trace whatever of him in the conspiracy; no information had touched him, no\n      suspicion had been breathed of him. I undertook his cause, O Torquatus; I undertook it, and I\n      did so  willingly, in order that, while good men had always, as I hope, thought\n      me virtuous and firm, not even bad men might he able to call me cruel."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "22", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "23", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "8", "@unit": "chapter"}], "pb": {"@n": "383"}, "#text": "This Torquatus then, O judges, says that he cannot endure my kingly power.

In my discharge of that office, O judges, kingly power was not\n      established by me, but put down. Will you say that then, when I had such absolute power and\n      authority over all the military and civil affairs of the state, I was not a king, but that\n      now, when I am only a private individual, I have the power of a king? Under what title?\n      Why, because, says he, those against whom you gave evidence\n      were convicted, and the man whom you defend hopes that he shall be acquitted. Here\n      I make you this reply, as to what concerns my evidence: that if I gave false evidence, you\n      also gave evidence against the same man; if my testimony was true, then I say, that persuading\n      the judges to believe a true statement, which one has made on oath, is a very different thing\n      from being a king. And of the hopes of my client, I only say, that Publius Sulla does not\n      expect from me any exertion of my influence or interest, or, in short, anything except to\n      defend him with good faith.  But unless\n      you, says he, had undertaken his cause, he would never have resisted me,\n      but would have fled without saying a word in his defence. Even if I were to grant\n      to you that Quintus Hortensius, being a man of such wisdom as he is, and that all these men of\n      high character, rely not on their own judgment but on mine; if I were to grant to you, what no\n      one can believe, that these men would not have countenanced Publius Sulla if I had not done so\n      too; still, which is the king, he whom men, though perfectly innocent, cannot resist, or he\n      who does not abandon men in misfortune? But here too, though you had not the least occasion\n      for it, you took a fancy to be witty, when you called me Tarquin, and Numa, and the third\n      foreign king of Rome. I won't say any more about the word king; but I should like to know why\n      you called me a foreigner. For, if I am such, then it is not so marvellous that I should be a\n      king,because, as you say yourself, foreigners have before now been kings at\n      Rome,as that a foreigner should be a consul at Rome. This is what  I mean, says he, that you come from a municipal\n      town.  I confess that I do, and I add, that I\n      come from that municipal town from which salvation to this city and empire has more than once\n      proceeded. But I should like exceedingly to know from you, how it is that those men who come\n      from the municipal towns appear to you to be foreigners. For no one ever made that objection\n      to that great man, Marcus Cato the elder, though he had many enemies, or to Titus Coruncanius,\n      or to Marcus Curius, or even to that great hero of our own times, Caius Marius, through many\n      men envied him.

And if, O judges, it is fit for me and you to be considered\n      foreigners by the rest of the patricians, still nothing ought to be said about this blot by\n      Torquatus.

They say that they themselves inquired of Cassius what Sulla's opinions were. Observe\n      the diligence of the Gauls. They, knowing nothing of the life or character of the man, but\n      only having heard that he and Autronius had met with one common disaster, asked whether his\n      inclinations were the same? what then? Even if Cassius had made answer that Sulla was of the\n      same opinion, and was favourable to their views, still it would not seem to me that that reply\n      ought to be made matter of accusation against him. How so? Because, as it was his object to\n      instigate the barbarians to war, it was no business of his to weaken their expectations, or to\n      acquit those men of whom they did entertain some suspicions.  But yet he did not reply, that Sulla was favourable to their designs. And, in truth, it\n      would have been an absurdity, after he had named every one else of his own accord, to make no\n      mention of Sulla till he was reminded of him and asked about him. Unless you think this\n      probable, that Lucius Cassius had quite forgotten the name of Publius Sulla. Even if the high\n      rank of the man, and his unfortunate condition, and the relics of his ancient dignity had not\n      made him notorious, still the mention of Autronius must have recalled Sulla to his\n      recollection. In truth, it is my opinion that when Cassius was enumerating the authority of\n      the chief men of the conspiracy for the purpose of exciting the minds of the Allobroges as he\n      knew that the foreign nations are especially moved by an illustrious name he could not have\n      named Autronius before Sulla, if he had been able to name Sulla at all.  But no one can be induced to believe this,that the Gauls, the\n      moment that Autronius was named, should have thought, on account of the similarity of their\n      misfortunes, that it was worth their while to make inquiries about Sulla, but that Cassius, if\n      he really was implicated in this wickedness, should never have once recollected Sulla, even\n      after he had named Autronius. However, what was the reply which Cassius made about Sulla? He\n      said that he was not sure. He does not acquit him, says Torquatus. I\n      have said before, that, even if he had accused him, when he was interrogated in this manner,\n      his reply ought not to have been made matter of accusation against Sulla.  But I think that, in judicial proceedings and examinations, the thing to be\n      inquired is, not whether any one is exculpated, but whether any one is inculpated. And in\n      truth, when Cassius says that he does not know, is he seeking to exculpate Sulla, or proving\n      clearly enough that he really does not know? He is unwilling to compromise him with the Gauls.\n      Why so? That they may not mention him in their information? what? If he had supposed that\n      there was any danger of their ever giving any information at all, would he have made that\n      confession respecting himself? He did not know it. I suppose, O judges, Sulla was the only\n      person about whom Cassius was kept in the dark. For he certainly was well informed about every\n      one else; and it was thoroughly proved that a great deal of the conspiracy was hatched at his\n      house. As he did not like to deny that Sulla made one of the conspirators, his object being to\n      give the Gauls as much hope as possible, and as he did not venture to assert what was\n      absolutely false, he said that he did not know. But this is quite evident, that as he, who\n      knew the truth about every one, said that he did not know about Sulla, the same weight is due\n      to this denial of his as if he had said that be did know that he had nothing to do with the\n      conspiracy.  For when it is perfectly certain that a man is acquainted with all\n      the conspirators, his ignorance of any one ought to be considered an acquittal of him. But I\n      am not asking now whether Cassius acquits Sulla; this is quite sufficient for me, that there\n      is not one word to implicate Sulla in the whole information of the Allobroges."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "41", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "42", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "15", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "Torquatus being cut off from this article of his accusation, again turns against me, and\n      accuses me.

If as you say, his statement concerns that crew of Autronius and\n      Catiline, when they intended to commit a massacre in the Campus Martius, at the consular\n       , which were held by me; we saw Autronius that day in the\n      Campus.

If he himself had afterwards learnt something, of which\n      he had been ignorant when consul, still we must pardon those men who had heard nothing since\n      that time. But if the first accusation had weight, it ought not to have had more weight when\n      it was old than when it was fresh. But if your parent, even when he was not without suspicion\n      of danger to himself, was still induced by pity to do honour to the defence of a most\n      worthless man by his curule chair, by his own private dignity, and by that of his office as\n      consul, then what reason is there for reproaching the men of consular rank who gave Catiline\n      the countenance of their presence? But the same men did not countenance those who\n      were tried for their accession to this conspiracy before Sulla. Certainly not; they\n      resolved that no aid, no assistance, no support ought to be given by them to men implicated in\n      such wickedness. And that I may speak for a moment of their constancy and attachment to the\n      republic, whose silent virtue and loyalty bears witness in behalf of every one of them, and\n      needs no ornaments of language from any one,can any one say that any time there\n      were men of consular rank more virtuous, more fearless, or more firm, than those who lived in\n      these critical and perilous times, in which the republic was nearly overwhelmed? Who of them\n      did not, with the greatest openness, and bravery, and earnestness, give his whole thoughts to\n      the common safety? Nor need I confine what I say to the men of consular rank. For this credit\n      is due to all those accomplished men who have been praetors, and indeed to the whole senate in\n      common; so that it is plain that never, in the memory of man, was there more virtue in that\n      order, greater attachment to the republic, or more consummate wisdom, But because the men of\n      consular rank were especially mentioned, I thought I ought to say thus much in their behalf;\n      and that that would be enough, as the recollection of all men would join me in bearing\n      witness, that there was not one man of that rank who did not labour with all his virtue, and\n      energy, and influence, to preserve the republic."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "84", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "85", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "31", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "86", "@unit": "section"}], "pb": {"@n": "408"}, "#text": "But what comes next?

In truth, as men\n      in Greece were in the habit of giving rights of citizenship to many men of very ordinary\n      qualifications, and endowed with no talents at all, or with very moderate ones, without any\n      payment, it is likely, I suppose, that the Rhegians, and Locrians, and Neapolitans, and\n      Tarentines should have been unwilling to give to this man, enjoying the highest possible\n      reputation for genius, what they were in the habit of giving even to theatrical artists. What,\n      when other men, who not only after the freedom of the city had been given, but even after the\n      passing of the Papian law, crept somehow or other into the registers of those municipalities,\n      shall he be rejected who does not avail himself of those other lists in which he is enrolled,\n      because he always wished to be considered a Heraclean?  You\n      demand to see our own censor's returns. I suppose no one knows that at the time of the last\n      census he was with that most illustrious general, Lucius Lucullus, with the army; that at the\n      time of the preceding one he was with the same man when he was in Asia as quaestor; and that\n      in the census before that, when Julius and Crassus were censors, no regular account of the\n      people was taken. But, since the census does not confirm the right of citizenship, but only\n      indicates that he, who is returned in the census, did at that time claim to be considered as a\n      citizen, I say that, at that time, when you say, in your speech for the prosecution, that he\n      did not even himself consider that he had any claim to the privileges of a Roman citizen, he\n      more than once made a will according to our laws, and he entered upon inheritances left him by\n      Roman citizens; and he was made honourable mention of by Lucius Lucullus, both as praetor and\n      as consul, in the archives kept in the treasury."}, {"milestone": {"@n": "12", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "You must rely wholly on what arguments you can find.

Do you think it possible that we\n      could find a supply for our daily speeches, when discussing such a variety of matters, unless\n      we were to cultivate our minds by the study of literature; or that our minds could bear being\n      kept so constantly on the stretch if we did not relax them by that same study? But I confess\n      that I am devoted to those studies, let others be ashamed of them if they have buried\n      themselves in books without being able to produce anything out of them for the common\n      advantage or anything which may bear the eyes of men and the light. But why need I be ashamed,\n      who for many years have lived in such a manner as never to allow my own love of tranquillity\n      to deny me to the necessity or advantage of another or my fondness for pleasure to distract,\n      or even sleep to delay my attention to such claims?  Who\n      then can reproach me or who has any right to be angry with me, if I allow myself as much time\n      for the cultivation of these studies as some take for the performance of their own business,\n      or for celebrating days of festival and games, or for other pleasures, or even for the rest\n      and refreshment of mind and body, or as others devote to early banquets, to playing at dice,\n      or at ball? And this ought to be permitted to me, because by these studies my power of\n      speaking and those faculties are improved, which, as far as they do exist in me, have never\n      been denied to my friends when they have been in peril. And if that ability appears to any one\n      to be but moderate, at all events I know whence I derive those principles which are of the\n      greatest value.  For if I had not persuaded myself from my\n      youth upwards, both by the precepts of many masters and by much reading, that there is nothing\n      in life greatly to be desired, except praise and honour, and that while pursuing those things\n      all tortures of the body, all dangers of death and banishment are to be considered but of\n      small importance, I should never have exposed myself, in defence of your safety, to such\n      numerous and arduous contests, and to these daily attacks of profligate men. But all books are\n      full of such precepts, and all the sayings of philosophers, and all antiquity is full of\n      precedents teaching the same lesson; but all these things would lie buried in darkness, if the\n      light of literature and learning were not applied to them. How many images of the bravest men,\n      carefully elaborated, have both the Greek and Latin writers bequeathed to us, not merely for\n      us to look at and gaze upon, but also for our imitation! And I, always keeping them before my\n      eyes as examples for my own public conduct, have endeavoured to model my mind and views by\n      continually thinking of those excellent men."}, {"pb": {"@n": "418"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "16", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "8", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "17", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Some one will ask, What? were those identical  great men, whose\n      virtues have been recorded in books, accomplished in all that learning which you are extolling\n      so highly?

For when a young man, he touched on our\n      wars against the Cimbri, and gained the favour even of Caius Marius himself, a man who was\n      tolerably proof against this sort of study.  For there was\n      no one so  disinclined to the Muses as not willingly to endure that the praise of\n      his labours should be made immortal by means of verse. They say that the great Themistocles,\n      the greatest man that Athens produced, said, when some one asked him what sound or whose voice\n      he took the greatest delight in hearing, The voice of that by whom his own exploits\n      were best celebrated. Therefore, the great Marius was also exceedingly attached to\n      Lucius Plotius, because he thought that the achievement which he had performed could be\n      celebrated by his genius.  And the whole Mithridatic war,\n      great and difficult as it was, and carried on with so much diversity of fortune by land and\n      sea, has been related at length by him; and the books in which that is sung of, not only make\n      illustrious Lucius Lucullus, that most gallant and celebrated man, but they do honour also to\n      the Roman people. For, while Lucullus was general, the Roman people opened Pontus, though it\n      was defended both by the resources of the king and by the character of the country itself.\n      Under the same general the army of the Roman people, with no very great numbers, routed the\n      countless hosts of the Armenians. It is the glory of the Roman people that, by the wisdom of\n      that same general, the city of the Cyzicenes, most friendly to us, was delivered and preserved\n      from all the attacks of the kind, and from the very jaws as it were of the whole war. Ours is\n      the glory which will be for ever celebrated, which is derived from the fleet of the enemy\n      which was sunk after its admirals had been slain, and from the marvellous naval battle off\n      Tenedos: those trophies belong to us, those monuments are ours, those triumphs are ours.\n      Therefore, I say that the men by whose genius these exploits are celebrated, make illustrious\n      at the same time the glory of the Roman people.  Our\n      countryman, Ennius, was dear to the elder Africanus; and even on the tomb of the Scipios his\n      effigy is believed to be visible, carved in the marble. But undoubtedly it is not only the men\n      who are themselves praised who are done honour to by those praises, but the name of the Roman\n      people also is adorned by them. Cato, the ancestor of this Cato, is extolled to the skies.\n      Great honour is paid to the exploits of the Roman people.

Wherefore, if those achievements which we have performed are limited only by the\n      bounds of the whole world, we ought to desire that, wherever our vigour and our arms have\n      penetrated, our glory and our fame should likewise extend.

How many historians of his exploits\n      is Alexander the Great said to have had with him; and he, when standing on Cape Sigeum at the\n      grave of Achilles, saidO happy youth, to find Homer as the panegyrist of\n      your glory! And he said the truth; for, if the  had not\n      existed, the same tomb which covered his body would have also buried his renown.

Would not he who  thought the industry of a bad poet still worthy of\n      some reward, have sought out the genius, and excellence, and copiousness in writing of this\n      man?  What more need I say? Could he not have obtained the\n      freedom of the city from Quintus Metellus Pius, his own most intimate friend, who gave it to\n      many men, either by his own request, or by the intervention of the Luculli? especially when\n      Metellus was so anxious to have his own deeds celebrated in writing, that he gave his\n      attention willingly to poets born even at Cordova, whose poetry had a very heavy and foreign\n      flavour."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "27", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "28", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "For this should not be concerned, which cannot possibly be kept in the dark, but it might be\n      avowed openly: we are all influenced by a desire of praise, and the best men are the most\n      especially attracted by glory.

Not that I, for my own part,\n      would be more inclined than others to refuse credit to that nation; for if ever there was any\n      one of our countrymen not averse to that race of men, and proving himself so by zeal and\n      good-will, I think that I am that man, and that I was so even more when I had more leisure;\n      but there are in that body many virtuous, many learned, many modest men, and they have not\n      been brought hither to this trial. There are also many impudent, illiterate, worthless\n      persons, and those I see here, impelled by various motives. But I say this of the whole race\n      of Greeks; I allow them learning, I allow them a knowledge of many arts; I do not deny them\n      wit in conversation, acuteness of talents, and fluency in speaking; even if they claim praise\n      for other sorts of ability, I will not make any objection; but a scrupulous regard to truth in\n      giving their evidence is not a virtue that that nation has ever cultivated; they are utterly\n      ignorant what is the meaning of that quality, they know nothing of its authority or of its\n      weight.  Where does that  expression,\n      Give evidence for me, and I will give evidence for you, come from? is it\n      supposed to be a phrase of the Gauls, or of the Spaniards? It belongs wholly to the Greeks; so\n      that even those who do not understand Greek know what form of expression is used by the Greeks\n      for this. Therefore, when they give their evidence, remark with what a countenance, with what\n      confidence they give it; and then you will become aware how scrupulous they are as to what\n      evidence they give.

Marcus Lurco gave\n      evidence against Flaccus, being angry (as he said himself) because his freedman had been\n      condemned by a decision of his involving infamy. He said nothing which could injure him,\n      though he was eager to do so; for his conscientious regard to his oath prevented him.\n        And yet with what modesty, with what trembling and\n      paleness did he say what he did! How ready to give evidence was Publius Septimius; how angry\n      was he about some former trial, and about his steward: yet he hesitated; yet his\n      scrupulousness was at times at variance with his anger. Marcus Caelius was an enemy to\n      Flaccus, because, as Flaccus had thought it wrong for one publican to decide on the case of\n      another publican, though the case was ever so evident he had been removed from the list of\n      judges.

I must then be content with complaining and lamenting, as I have been some time\n      doing, the general iniquity of the whole prosecution, and, in the first place, the whole class\n      of witnesses; for that nation is the witness which is the least scrupulous of all in giving\n      evidence. I come nearer;I say that that is not evidence which you yourself call\n      decrees; but that it is only the grumbling of needy men, and a sort of random movement of a\n      miserable Greek  assembly. I will come in still further,he who has\n      done it is not present; he who is said to have paid the money is not brought hither; no\n      private letters are produced; the public documents have been retained in the power of the\n      prosecutors. The main point of my argument concerns the witnesses. These men are living with\n      our enemies, they come into court with our adversaries, they are dwelling in the same house\n      with our prosecutors.  Do you think that this is an\n      examination and an inquiry into the truth, or an endeavour to fix a stain, and bring ruin upon\n      innocence? for there are many things of such a sort, O judges, that even if they deserve to be\n      neglected, as far as the individual whom they more immediately affect is concerned, are still\n      to be dreaded, because of the state of facts of which they betoken the existence, and because\n      of the precedents which they afford."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "25", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "26", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "12", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "This is not quite true, for Cicero is referring to Publius Valerius, surnamed\n       Publicola, and he was not the first consul; but was elected as a substitute for Collatinus,\n       who, with Brutus, was the first consul."}, "#text": "If I were defending a man of the lowest rank, of no splendour of reputation, and recommended\n      by no innocence of character, still, relying on the rights of common humanity and mercy, I\n      should beg from citizens, on behalf of another citizen, that you would not give up your\n      fellow-citizen and your suppliant to witnesses who are strangers to you; who are urged on to\n      give their evidence; who are the companions, and messmates, and comrades of the prosecutor; to\n      men who from their fickleness are Greeks, but who, as far as cruelty goes, are barbarians: I\n      should entreat you not to leave posterity so dangerous a precedent for their imitation.\n        But when the interests of Lucius Flaccus are at stake, a\n      man of whom I may say that the first man who was made consul of his family  was the first man that was ever consul in this\n      city; a man by whose valour the kings were banished, and liberty was established in this\n      republic; a family which has endured to this time with a continued series of honours and\n      commands, and of glorious achievements; and when Lucius Flaccus has not only not degenerated\n      from this everlasting and well-attested virtue of his ancestors, but as praetor has especially\n      devoted himself to the glory of asserting the liberty of his country, seeing that that was the\n      especial glory and characteristic of his family,can I fear lest any mischievous\n      precedent be established in the case of this defendant when, even if he had committed any\n      slight fault, all good men would think that they ought rather to connive at it?

But if this\n      be a crime, the guilt must consist either in the fact that it was not lawful so to levy money;\n      or in the fact that the ships were not wanted; or in the third alternative, that no fleet put\n      to sea while he was praetor. That you may see that this levy was lawful, listen, I pray you,\n      to what the senate decreed, when I was consul, in which it did not depart at all from the\n      former decrees of many years running. [The resolution of the senate is read.] The next thing\n      is for us to inquire whether there was need of the fleet or not. Is it then the Greeks or any\n      foreign nations who are to be judges of this, or your praetors, your generals, your\n      commanders-in-chief? I indeed think that in a district and province of that sort which is\n      surrounded by the sea, dotted all over with harbours, and girt with islands, a fleet is\n      requisite not only for the sake of protection, but as an ornament of the empire.  For there were these principles and there was this greatness of mind\n      in our ancestors, that while in their private affairs, and as to their own personal expenses,\n      they lived contented with a little, and without the smallest approach to luxury; where the\n      empire and the dignity of the state was concerned, they brought everything up to a high pitch\n      of splendour and magnificence. For in a man's private affairs he desires the credit of\n      moderation, but in public affairs dignity is the object aimed at. But even if he had a fleet\n      for the sake of protection, who will be so unjust as to blame it?There\n      were no pirates.

Say, rather, that you yourself are\n      increasing his difficulties. For he destroyed the fleets of the pirates, their cities, and\n      harbours, and places of refuge. By his surpassing valour and incredible rapidity of motion he\n      established a maritime peace; but this he neither undertook nor ought to have\n      undertaken,namely, to submit to appear worthy of prosecution if a single pirate's\n      boat was anywhere seen. Therefore he himself in Asia, when he had terminated every war, both\n      by land and sea, nevertheless levied a fleet on those self-same cities. And if he then thought\n      that step was necessary, when everything might have been safe and tranquil through fear of his\n      name, while he was still in those countries, what do you think that Flaccus ought to have\n      decided on and to have done after he had departed?"}, "What? did not we decree, by the advice of Pompeius himself, in the consulship of Silanus and\n      Murena, that a fleet should put to sea to sail round Italy?

In what then is it that we look in vain for the diligence of the praetor? Is it in\n      the number of the ships or in the equal division of the expense? He demanded just one half the\n      fleet which Pompeius required. Could he be more economical? And he divided the expense\n      according to the proportions settled by Pompeius, which was adapted to the division made by\n      Sulla, who, when he had arranged all the cities in Asia according to the proportion that they\n      were to bear of the expense imposed on the whole provinces, adopted a rule which Pompeius and\n      Flaccus followed in raising the necessary sums, and even to this day the whole sum is not\n      collected.

Very much against its\n      will, it had paid Castricius some money which had long been due to him. Hence comes all its\n      hatred to Flaccus, and this is his whole offence. And when Laelius had arrived in that city\n      among a set of angry men, and had re-opened their indignation with respect to Castricius by\n      mentioning the subject, the chief men jumped up and left the place, and refused to be present\n      in that assembly, and would not assist in carrying the decree, or in framing the deposition.\n      And to such an extent was that assembly deprived of the presence of the nobles of the city,\n      that Maeandrius was the chief of the chief men present; and it was by his tongue, acting like\n      a sort of fan of sedition, that assembly of needy men was ventilated.  Therefore, now learn the justice of the grief and complaints of a city, a\n      moderate city, as I have always considered it, and a worthy one, as the citizens themselves\n      wish it to be thought.

A town was selected in which, above all others, the money contributed by all Asia\n      for the honours of Lucius Flaccus should be deposited.

And this, forsooth, is the reason why\n      this cause is pleaded near the steps of Aurelius.

You know how numerous that crowd is,\n      how great is its unanimity, and of what weight it is in the popular assemblies. I will speak\n      in a low voice, just so as to let the judges hear me. For men are not wanting who would be\n      glad to excite that people against me and against every eminent man; and I will not assist\n      them and enable them to do so more easily.  As gold, under\n      pretence of being given to the Jews, was accustomed every year to be exported out of Italy and\n      all the provinces to Jerusalem, Flaccus issued an edict establishing a law that it should not\n      be lawful for gold to be exported out of Asia. And who is there, O judges, who cannot honestly\n      praise this measure? The senate had often decided, and when I was consul it came to a most\n      solemn resolution that gold ought not to be exported. But to resist this barbarous\n      superstition were an act of dignity, to despise the multitude of Jews, which at times was most\n      unruly in the assemblies in defence of the interests of the republic, was an act of the\n      greatest wisdom. But Cnaeus Pompeius, after he had taken Jerusalem, though he was a\n      conqueror, touched nothing which was in that temple.  In the first place, he acted wisely, as he did in many other instances, in\n      leaving no room for his detractors to say anything against him, in a city so prone to\n      suspicion and to evil speaking. For I do not suppose that the religion of the Jews, our\n      enemies, was any obstacle to that most illustrious general, but that he was hindered by his\n      own modesty. Where then is the guilt? Since you nowhere impute any theft to us, since you\n      approve of the edict, and confess that it was passed in due form, and did not deny that the\n      gold was openly sought for and produced the facts of the case themselves show that the\n      business was executed by the instrumentality of men of the highest character. There was a\n      hundredweight of gold, more or less openly seized at Apamea, and weighed out in the forum at\n      the feet of the praetor, by Sextus Caesius, a Roman knight, a most excellent and upright man;\n      twenty pounds weight or a little more were seized at Laodicea, by Lucius Peducaeus, who is\n      here in court, one of our judges; some was seized also at Adramyttium, by Cnaeus Domitius, the\n      lieutenant, and a small quantity at Pergamus.  The amount of\n      the gold is known; the gold is in the treasury; no theft is imputed to him; but it is\n      attempted to render him unpopular. The speaker turns away from the judges, and addresses\n      himself to the surrounding multitude. Each city, O Laelius, has its own peculiar religion we\n      have ours. While Jerusalem was flourishing, and while the Jews were in a peaceful state, still\n      the religious ceremonies and observances of that people were very much at variance with the\n      splendour of this empire and the dignity of our name and the institutions of our ancestors.\n      And they are the more odious to us now because that nation has shown by arms what were its\n      feelings towards our supremacy.

You bring a new face, an old name; Tyrian garments, in which respect I envy you, that\n      with only one cloak you look so smart for such a length of time.  However, be it so. You like to practise commerce. Why not at Pergamus? at\n      Smyrna? at Tralles? where there are many Roman citizens, and where magistrates of our own\n      preside in the courts of justice. You are fond of ease: lawsuits, crowds, and praetors are\n      odious to you. You delight in the freedom of the Greeks. Why, then, do you alone treat the\n      people of Apollonides, the allies who of all others are the most attached to the Roman people\n      and the most faithful, in a more miserable manner than either  Mithridates, or\n      than your own father ever treated them? Why do you prevent them from enjoying their own\n      liberty? why do you prevent them from being free? They are of all Asia the most frugal, the\n      most conscientious men, the most remote from the luxury and inconstancy of the Greeks; they\n      are fathers of families, are content with their own, farmers, country-people. They have lands\n      excellent by nature, and improved by diligence and cultivation. In this district you wished to\n      have some farms. I should greatly prefer, (and it would have been more for your interest too,\n      if you wanted some fertile lands,) that you should have got some here somewhere in the\n      district of Crustumii, or in the Capenate country.  However,\n      be it so. It is an old saying of Cato's,that money is balanced by\n      distance. It is a very long way from the Tiber to the Caicus,a place in\n      which Agamemnon himself would have lost his way, if he had not found Telephus for his guide.\n      However, I give up all that.

Clodius, (by the assistance of Julius\n       Caesar, who was offended with Cicero for refusing to support the measures of the\n       triumvirate,) got adopted as a plebeian, in order to be made tribune of the people, so as to\n       have the greater power to annoy Cicero. He was elected tribune A. U. C. 696. And the consuls,\n       Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus and Aulus Gabinius, were also enemies to Cicero. After some\n       preliminary laws, mostly aimed, in Cicero's opinion, at him, Clodius proposed a special law,\n       that whoever had taken away the life of a citizen uncondemned and without a trial,\n       should be prohibited from fire and water. This alluded especially to Cicero's\n       having executed the accomplices of Catiline; and he accordingly changed his dress, as it was\n       usual for people to do in the case of a public impeachment, and appeared in the streets in a\n       mourning robe, and the whole body of the knights and the young nobility, to the number of\n       twenty thousand, as he says himself in his speech to the people after his return, also\n       changed their dress, and accompanied him about the city to protect him from the insults of\n       Clodius's partisans, and to implore the assistance of the people. And all this body went to\n       the consuls to implore their favour for Cicero; but Piso refused to see them, and Gabinius\n       treated them with the greatest insolence, which caused such indignation in the assembly that\n       Ninnius the tribune made a motion (which was carried unanimously) that the senate also should\n       put on mourning robes.

They were not consuls, but dealers in provinces, and sellers of your dignity.\n      One of whom demanded back from me, in the hearing of many, Catiline, his lover; the other\n      reclaimed Cethegus, his cousin;the two most wicked men in the memory of man, who (I\n      will not call them consuls, but robbers) not only deserted, in a cause in which, above all\n      others, the welfare of the republic and the dignity of the consulship was concerned, but\n      betrayed me, and opposed me, and wished to see me stripped of all aid, not only from\n      themselves, but also from you and from the other orders of the state.

For Quintus Metellus, himself an enemy of mine, and a brother of an enemy of mine, as\n      soon as he was assured of your inclinations, laid aside his own private dislike to me  and allowed Publius Servilius, a most illustrious man, and also a most virtuous\n      one, and a most intimate friend of my own, to recall him, by what I may call the divine\n      influence of his authority and eloquence, to the exploits and virtues of his race and of their\n      common family, so as to take to his counsels his brother, in the shades below, the companion\n      of my fortunes, and all the Metelli, those most admirable citizens, summoning them as it were\n      from Acheron; and among them the great conqueror of Numidia, whose departure from his country\n      formerly seemed grievous to all the citizens, but scarcely even vexatious to himself.\n        He, therefore, turns out now, not only a defender of my\n      safety, having been previously to this one kindness of his always my enemy, but even the\n      seconder of my restoration to my dignity. And on that day when you met in the senate to the\n      number of four hundred and seventeen, and when all these magistrates were present one alone\n      dissented; he who thought that the conspirators could by his law be awakened from the shades\n      below. And on that day when in most weighty and copious language you delivered your decision,\n      that the republic had been preserved by my counsels, he as consul again took care that the\n      same things should be said by the chief men of the state in the assembly the next day; and he\n      then spoke on my behalf with the greatest eloquence, and brought the assembly into such a\n      state, all Italy standing by and listening, that no one would listen to the hateful and\n      detested voice of any of my hired or profligate enemies."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "comitia centuriata"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "comitia"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "28", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "29", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "To these acts of his, being not only aids to my safety, but even ornaments of my dignity,\n      you yourselves added the rest that was wanting.

And what he said was, as I have\n      understood, divided under three heads.

Therefore, when Publius Servilius, a man of the greatest dignity, and a\n      most accomplished citizen, had said that it was through my labours that the republic had been\n      handed over to the magistrates in a sound condition, all the rest declared their assent to\n      that statement. But you heard at that time not only the authoritative declaration, but the\n      sworn evidence of a most illustrious man, Lucius Gellius, who, because he was aware that his\n      fleet had been tampered with, and that he himself had been in great danger, said in your\n      assembly that if I had not been consul when I was, the republic would have been utterly\n      destroyed."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "19", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "20", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "21", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "9", "@unit": "chapter"}], "pb": {"@n": "500"}, "#text": "I now, O Romans, having been restored to myself, to my friends, and to the republic, owing\n      to the evidence of so many men, by this authority of the senateby such great\n      unanimity of all Italyby such great zeal on the part of all good menby\n      the particular agency of Publius Lentulus, with the cooperation of all the other\n      magistrateswhile Cnaeus Pompeius was begging for my recall, and while all men\n      favoured it and even the immortal gods showed their approbation of it by the fertility and\n      abundance and cheapness of the crops,promise you, O Romans, all that I can do.

I saw that most brave man, a fellow-citizen of my own municipal town, Caius\n      Marius, since, as if by some fatal necessity, we both had not only to contend with those who\n      wished to destroy all these things, but with fortune alsostill I saw him, when he\n      was in extreme  old age, with a spirit not only not broken on account of the\n      greatness of his misfortunes, but even strengthened and refreshed by it.  And I heard him say that he had been miserable when he was deprived of his\n      country which he had delivered from siege; when he heard that his property was taken\n      possession of and plundered by his enemies; when he saw his young son a sharer of the same\n      calamity; when, up to his neck in the marshes, he only preserved his body and his life by the\n      aid of the Minturnensians, who thronged to the place and pitied him; when, having crossed over\n      to Africa in a little boat, he had arrived as a beggar and a suppliant among those people to\n      whom he himself had given kingdoms; but that now that he had recovered his dignity he would\n      take care, as all those things which he had lost had been restored to him, still to preserve\n      that fortitude of mind which he never had lost. But there is this difference between myself\n      and him, that he used those means in which he was most powerful, namely his arms, in order to\n      revenge himself on his enemies. I, too, will use the instrument to which I am accustomed;\n      since it is in war and sedition that there is room for his qualities, but in peace and\n      tranquillity that there is scope for mine.
