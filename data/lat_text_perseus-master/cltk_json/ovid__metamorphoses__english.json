            "1":"\n\n Before the Sea and Lande were made, and Heaven that all doth hide, \n In all the worlde one onely face of nature did abide, \n Which Chaos hight, a huge rude heape, and nothing else but even \n A heavie lump and clottred clod of seedes togither driven, \n Of things at strife among themselves, for want of order due. \n No sunne as yet with lightsome beames the shapelesse world did vew. \n No Moone in growing did repayre hir hornes with borowed light. \n Nor yet the earth amiddes the ayre did hang by wondrous slight \n Just peysed by hir proper weight. Nor winding in and out \n Did Amphitrytee with hir armes embrace the earth about. \n For where was earth, was sea and ayre, so was the earth unstable. \n The ayre all darke, the sea likewise to beare a ship unable. \n No kinde of thing had proper shape, but ech confounded other. \n For in one selfesame bodie strove the hote and colde togither, \n The moist with drie, the soft with hard, the light with things of weight. \n This strife did God and Nature breake, and set in order streight. \n The earth from heaven, the sea from earth, he parted orderly, \n And from the thicke and foggie ayre, he tooke the lightsome skie. \n Which when he once unfolded had, and severed from the blinde \n And clodded heape, he setting eche from other did them binde \n In endlesse friendship to agree. The fire most pure and bright, \n The substance of the heaven it selfe, bicause it was so light \n Did mount aloft, and set it selfe in highest place of all. \n The second roume of right to ayre, for lightnesse did befall. \n The earth more grosse drew down with it eche weighty kinde of matter, \n And set it selfe in lowest place. Againe, the waving water \n Did lastly chalenge for his place, the utmost coast and bound, \n Of all the compasse of the earth, to close the stedfast ground. \n Now when he in this foresaid wise (what God so ere he was) \n Had broke and into members put this rude confused masse, \n Then first bicause in every part, the earth should equall bee, \n He made it like a mighty ball, in compasse as we see. \n And here and there he cast in seas, to whome he gave a lawe: \n To swell with every blast of winde, and every stormie flawe. \n And with their waves continually to beate upon the shore, \n Of all the earth within their boundes enclosde by them afore. \n Moreover, Springs and mighty Meeres and Lakes he did augment, \n And flowing streames of crooked brookes in winding bankes he pent. \n Of which the earth doth drinke up some, and some with restlesse race \n Do seeke the sea: where finding scope of larger roume and space, \n In steade of bankes, they beate on shores. He did commaund the plaine \n And champion groundes to stretch out wide: and valleys to remaine \n Aye underneath: and eke the woods to hide them decently \n With tender leaves: and stonie hilles to lift themselves on hie. \n And as two Zones doe cut the Heaven upon the righter side, \n And other twaine upon the left likewise the same devide, \n The middle in outragious heat exceeding all the rest: \n Even so likewise through great foresight to God it seemed best, \n The earth encluded in the same should so devided bee, \n As with the number of the Heaven, hir Zones might full agree. \n Of which the middle Zone in heate, the utmost twaine in colde \n Exceede so farre, that there to dwell no creature dare be bolde. \n Betweene these two so great extremes, two other Zones are fixt, \n Where temprature of heate and colde indifferently is mixt. \n Now over this doth hang the Ayre, which as it is more fleightie \n Than earth or water: so againe than fire it is more weightie. \n There hath he placed mist and cloudes, and for to feare mens mindes, \n The thunder and the lightning eke, with colde and blustring windes. \n But yet the maker of the worlde permitteth not alway \n The windes to use the ayre at will. For at this present day, \n Though ech from other placed be in sundry coasts aside, \n The violence of their boystrous blasts, things scarsly can abide. \n They so turmoyle as though they would the world in pieces rende, \n So cruell is those brothers wrath when that they doe contende. \n And therefore to the morning graye, the Realme of Nabathie, \n To Persis and to other lands and countries that doe lie \n Farre underneath the Morning starre, did Eurus take his flight. \n Likewise the setting of the Sunne, and shutting in of night \n Belong to Zephyr. And the blasts of blustring Boreas raigne, \n in Scythia and in other landes set under Charles his waine. \n And unto Auster doth belong the coast of all the South, \n Who beareth shoures and rotten mistes, continuall in his mouth. \n Above all these he set aloft the cleare and lightsome skie, \n Without all dregs of earthly filth or grossenesse utterlie. \n The boundes of things were scarsly yet by him thus pointed out, \n But that appeared in the heaven, starres glistring all about, \n Which in the said confused heape had hidden bene before, \n And to th'intent with lively things eche Region for to store, \n The heavenly soyle, to Gods and Starres and Planets first he gave. \n The waters next both fresh and salt he let the fishes have. \n The suttle ayre to flickring fowles and birdes he hath assignde. \n The earth to beasts both wilde and tame of sundrie sort and kinde. \n Howbeit yet of all this while, the creature wanting was, \n Farre more devine, of nobler minde, which should the residue passe \n In depth of knowledge, reason, wit, and high capacitie, \n And which of all the residue should the Lord and ruler bee. \n Then eyther he that made the worlde, and things in order set, \n Of heavenly seede engendred Man: or else the earth as yet \n Yong, lustie, fresh, and in hir floures, and parted from the skie, \n But late before, the seede thereof as yet held inwardlie. \n The which Prometheus tempring straight with water of the spring, \n Did make in likenesse to the Gods that governe everie thing. \n And where all other beasts behold the ground with groveling eie, \n He gave to Man a stately looke replete with majestie. \n And willde him to behold the Heaven wyth countnance cast on hie, \n To marke and understand what things were in the starrie skie. \n And thus the earth which late before had neyther shape nor hew, \n Did take the noble shape of man, and was transformed new.\n\n \n",
            "2":"\n\n Then sprang up first the golden age, which of it selfe maintainde \n The truth and right of every thing unforct and unconstrainde. \n There was no feare of punishment, there was no threatning lawe \n In brazen tables nayled up, to keepe the folke in awe. \n There was no man would crouch or creepe to Judge with cap in hand, \n They lived safe without a Judge, in everie Realme and lande. \n The loftie Pynetree was not hewen from mountaines where it stood, \n In seeking straunge and forren landes, to rove upon the flood. \n Men knew none other countries yet, than where themselves did keepe: \n There was no towne enclosed yet, with walles and diches deepe. \n No horne nor trumpet was in use, no sword nor helmet worne, \n The worlde was such, that souldiers helpe might easly be forborne. \n The fertile earth as yet was free, untoucht of spade or plough, \n And yet it yeelded of it selfe of every things inough. \n And men themselves contented well with plaine and simple foode, \n That on the earth of natures gift without their travail stoode, \n Did live by Raspis, heppes and hawes, by cornelles, plummes and cherries, \n By sloes and apples, nuttes and peares, and lothsome bramble berries, \n And by the acornes dropt on ground, from Joves brode tree in fielde. \n The Springtime lasted all the yeare, and Zephyr with his milde \n And gentle blast did cherish things that grew of owne accorde, \n The ground untilde, all kinde of fruits did plenteously afforde. \n No mucke nor tillage was bestowde on leane and barren land, \n To make the corne of better head, and ranker for to stand. \n Then streames ran milke, then streames ran wine, and yellow honny flowde \n From ech greene tree whereon the rayes of firie Phebus glowde. \n But when that into Lymbo once Saturnus being thrust, \n The rule and charge of all the worlde was under Jove unjust, \n And that the silver age came in, more somewhat base than golde, \n More precious yet than freckled brasse, immediatly the olde \n And auncient Spring did Jove abridge, and made therof anon, \n Foure seasons: Winter, Sommer, Spring, and Autumne off and on: \n Then first of all began the ayre with fervent heate to swelt. \n Then Isycles hung roping downe: then for the colde was felt \n Men gan to shroud themselves in house. Their houses were the thickes, \n And bushie queaches, hollow caves, or hardels made of stickes. \n Then first of all were furrowes drawne, and corne was cast in ground. \n The simple Oxe with sorie sighes, to heavie yoke was bound. \n Next after this succeded streight, the third and brazen age: \n More hard of nature, somewhat bent to cruell warres and rage. \n But yet not wholy past all grace. Of yron is the last \n In no part good and tractable as former ages past. \n For when that of this wicked Age once opened was the veyne \n Therein all mischief rushed forth: then Fayth and Truth were faine \n And honest shame to hide their heades: for whom crept stoutly in, \n Craft, Treason, Violence, Envie, Pride and wicked Lust to win. \n The shipman hoyst his sailes to wind, whose names he did not knowe: \n And shippes that erst in toppes of hilles and mountaines had ygrowe, \n Did leape and daunce on uncouth waves: and men began to bound \n With dowles and diches drawen in length the free and fertile ground, \n Which was as common as the Ayre and light of Sunne before. \n Not onely corne and other fruites, for sustnance and for store, \n Were now exacted of the Earth: but eft they gan to digge, \n And in the bowels of the ground unsaciably to rigge, \n For Riches coucht and hidden deepe, in places nere to Hell, \n The spurres and stirrers unto vice, and foes to doing well. \n Then hurtfull yron came abrode, then came forth yellow golde, \n More hurtfull than the yron farre, then came forth battle bolde, \n That feightes with bothe, and shakes his sword in cruell bloudy hand. \n Men live by ravine and by stelth: the wandring guest doth stand \n In daunger of his host: the host in daunger of his guest: \n And fathers of their sonne in lawes: yea seldome time doth rest, \n Betweene borne brothers such accord and love as ought to bee. \n The goodman seekes the goodwifes death, and his againe seeks shee. \n The stepdames fell their husbandes sonnes with poyson do assayle. \n To see their fathers live so long the children doe bewayle. \n All godlynesse lies under foote. And Ladie Astrey, last \n Of heavenly vertues, from this earth in slaughter drowned past. \n And to th'intent the earth alone thus should not be opprest, \n And heaven above in slouthfull ease and carelesse quiet rest, \n Men say that Giantes went about the Realme of Heaven to win \n To place themselves to raigne as Gods and lawlesse Lordes therein. \n And hill on hill they heaped up aloft into the skie, \n Till God almighty from the Heaven did let his thunder flie, \n The dint whereof the ayrie tops of high Olympus brake, \n And pressed Pelion violently from under Ossa strake. \n When whelmed in their wicked worke those cursed Caitives lay, \n The Earth their mother tooke their bloud yet warme and (as they say) \n Did give it life. And for bicause some ympes should still remaine \n Of that same stocke, she gave it shape and limmes of men againe. \n This offspring eke against the Gods did beare a native spight, \n In slaughter and in doing wrong was all their whole delight. \n Their deedes declared them of bloud engendred for to bee. \n\n \n",
            "3":"\n\n The which as soone as Saturns sonne from Heaven aloft did see, \n He fetcht a sigh, and therwithall revolving in his thought \n The shamefull act which at a feast Lycaon late had wrought, \n As yet unknowne or blowne abrode: He gan thereat to storme \n And stomacke like an angry Jove. And therfore to reforme \n Such haynous actes, he sommonde streight his Court of Parliament, \n Whereto resorted all the Gods that had their sommons sent. \n Highe in the Welkin is a way apparant to the sight \n In starrie nights, which of his passing whitenesse Milkie hight: \n It is the streete that to the Court and Princely Pallace leades, \n Of mightie Jove whose thunderclaps eche living creature dreades. \n On both the sides of this same waye do stand in stately port \n The sumptuous houses of the Peeres. For all the common sort \n Dwell scattring here and there abrode: the face of all the skie \n The houses of the chiefe estates and Princes doe supplie. \n And sure and if I may be bolde to speake my fancie free \n I take this place of all the Heaven the Pallace for to bee. \n Now when the Goddes assembled were, and eche had tane his place, \n Jove standing up aloft and leaning on his yvorie Mace, \n Right dreadfully his bushie lockes did thrise or four times shake, \n Wherewith he made both Sea and Land and Heaven it self to quake, \n And afterward in wrathfull wordes his angrie minde thus brake: \n I never was in greater care nor more perplexitie, \n How to maintaine my soveraigne state and Princelie royaltie, \n When with their hundreth handes apiece the Adderfooted rout, \n Did practise for to conquere Heaven and for to cast us out. \n For though it were a cruell foe: yet did that warre depende \n Upon one ground, and in one stocke it had his finall ende. \n But now as farre as any sea about the worlde doth winde, \n I must destroy both man and beast and all the mortall kinde. \n I sweare by Styxes hideous streames that run within the ground, \n All other meanes must first be sought: but when there can be found \n No helpe to heale a festred sore, it must away be cut, \n Lest that the partes that yet are sound, in daunger should be put. \n We have a number in the worlde that mans estate surmount, \n Of such whom for their private Gods the countrie folkes account, \n As Satyres, Faunes, and sundry Nymphes, with Silvanes eke beside, \n That in the woods and hillie grounds continually abide. \n Whome into Heaven since that as yet we vouch not safe to take, \n And of the honour of this place copartners for to make, \n Such landes as to inhabite in, we erst to them assignde, \n That they should still enjoye the same, it is my will and minde. \n But can you thinke that they in rest and safetie shall remaine \n When proud Lycaon laye in waite by secret meanes and traine \n To have confounded me your Lorde, who in my hand doe beare \n The dreadfull thunder, and of whom even you doe stand in feare? \n The house was moved at his words and earnestly requirde, \n The man that had so traiterously against their Lord conspirde. \n Even so when Rebels did arise to stroy the Romane name, \n By shedding of our Cesars bloud, the horror of the same \n Did pierce the heartes of all mankinde, and made the world to quake. \n Whose fervent zeale in thy behalfe (O August) thou did take, \n As thankfully as Jove doth heare the loving care of his, \n Who beckning to them with his hand, forbiddeth them to hisse. \n And therewithall through all the house attentive silence is. \n As soone as that his majestie all muttring had alayde, \n He brake the silence once againe, and thus unto them sayde: \n Let passe this carefull thought of yours: for he that did offende, \n Hath dearely bought the wicked Act, the which he did entende. \n Yet shall you heare what was his fault and vengeance for the same. \n A foule report and infamie unto our hearing came \n Of mischiefe used in those times: which wishing all untrew \n I did descend in shape of man, th'infamed Earth to vew. \n It were a processe overlong to tell you of the sinne, \n That did abound in every place where as I entred in. \n The bruit was lesser than the truth, and partiall in report. \n The dreadfull dennes of Menalus where savage beastes resort \n And Cyllen had I overpast, with all the Pynetrees hie \n Of cold Lyceus, and from thence I entred by and by \n The herbroughlesse and cruell house of late th'Arcadian King, \n Such time as twilight on the Earth dim darknesse gan to bring. \n I gave a signe that God was come, and streight the common sort \n Devoutly prayde, whereat Lycaon first did make a sport \n And after said: By open proufe, ere long I minde to see, \n If that this wight a mighty God or mortall creature bee. \n The truth shall trie it selfe: he ment (the sequele did declare) \n To steale upon me in the night, and kyll me unbeware. \n And yet he was not so content: but went and cut the throte, \n Of one that laye in hostage there, which was an Epyrote: \n And part of him he did to rost, and part he did to stewe. \n Which when it came upon the borde, forthwith I overthrew \n The house with just revenging fire upon the owners hed, \n Who seeing that, slipt out of doores amazde for feare, and fled \n Into the wilde and desert woods, where being all alone, \n As he endevorde (but in vaine) to speake and make his mone, \n He fell a howling: wherewithall for verie rage and moode \n He ran me quite out of his wits and waxed furious woode. \n Still practising his wonted lust of slaughter on the poore \n And sielie cattle, thirsting still for bloud as heretofore, \n His garments turnde to shackie haire, his armes to rugged pawes: \n So is he made a ravening Wolfe: whose shape expressely drawes \n To that the which he was before: his skinne is horie graye, \n His looke still grim with glaring eyes, and every kinde of waye \n His cruell heart in outward shape doth well it selfe bewraye. \n Thus was one house destroyed quite, but that one house alone \n Deserveth not to be destroyde: in all the Earth is none, \n But that such vice doth raigne therein, as that ye would beleve, \n That all had sworne and solde themselves to mischiefe us to greve. \n And therefore as they all offende: so am I fully bent, \n That all forthwith (as they deserve) shall have due punishment. \n These wordes of Jove some of the Gods did openly approve, \n And with their sayings more to wrath his angry courage move. \n And some did give assent by signes. Yet did it grieve them all \n That such destruction utterly on all mankinde should fall, \n Demaunding what he purposed with all the Earth to doe, \n When that he had all mortall men so cleane destroyde, and whoe \n On holie Altars afterward should offer frankinsence, \n And whother that he were in minde to leave the Earth fro thence \n To savage beastes to wast and spoyle, bicause of mans offence. \n The king of Gods bade cease their thought and questions in that case, \n And cast the care thereof on him. Within a little space \n He promist for to frame a newe, an other kinde of men \n By wondrous meanes, unlike the first to fill the world agen.\n\n \n",
            "4":"\n\n And now his lightning had he thought on all the earth to throw, \n But that he feared lest the flames perhaps so hie should grow \n As for to set the Heaven on fire, and burne up all the skie. \n He did remember furthermore how that by destinie \n A certaine time should one day come, wherein both Sea and Lond \n And Heaven it selfe shoulde feele the force of Vulcans scorching brond, \n So that the huge and goodly worke of all the worlde so wide \n Should go to wrecke, for doubt whereof forthwith he laide aside \n His weapons that the Cyclops made, intending to correct \n Mans trespasse by a punishment contrary in effect. \n And namely with incessant showres from heaven ypoured downe, \n He did determine with himselfe the mortall kinde to drowne. \n In Aeolus prison by and by he fettred Boreas fast, \n With al such winds as chase the cloudes or breake them with their blast, \n And set at large the Southerne winde: who straight with watry wings \n And dreadfull face as blacke as pitch, forth out of prison flings. \n His beard hung full of hideous stormes, all dankish was his head, \n With water streaming downe his haire that on his shoulders shead. \n His ugly forehead wrinkled was with foggie mistes full thicke, \n And on his fethers and his breast a stilling dew did sticke. \n As soone as he betweene his hands the hanging cloudes had crusht, \n With ratling noyse adowne from heaven the raine full sadly gusht. \n The Rainbow, Junos messenger, bedect in sundrie hue, \n To maintaine moysture in the cloudes, great waters thither drue: \n The corne was beaten to the grounde, the Tilmans hope of gaine, \n For which he toyled all the yeare, lay drowned in the raine. \n Joves indignation and his wrath began to grow so hot \n That for to quench the rage thereof, his Heaven suffised not. \n His brother Neptune with his waves was faine to doe him ease: \n Who straight assembling all the streames that fall into the seas, \n Said to them standing in his house: Sirs get you home apace, \n (You must not looke to have me use long preaching in this case.) \n Poure out your force (for so is neede) your heads ech one unpende, \n And from your open springs, your streames with flowing waters sende. \n He had no sooner said the word, but that returning backe, \n Eche one of them unlosde his spring, and let his waters slacke. \n And to the Sea with flowing streames yswolne above their bankes, \n One rolling in anothers necke, they rushed forth by rankes. \n Himselfe with his threetyned Mace, did lend the earth a blow, \n That made it shake and open wayes for waters forth to flow. \n The flouds at randon where they list, through all the fields did stray, \n Men, beastes, trees, come, and with their gods were Churches washt away. \n If any house were built so strong, against their force to stonde \n Yet did the water hide the top: and turrets in that ponde \n Were overwhelmde: no difference was betweene the sea and ground, \n For all was sea: there was no shore nor landing to be found. \n Some climbed up to tops of hils, and some rowde to and fro \n In Botes, where they not long before, to plough and Cart did go, \n One over come and tops of townes, whome waves did overwhelme, \n Doth saile in ship, an other sittes a fishing in an Elme. \n In meddowes greene were Anchors cast (so fortune did provide) \n And crooked ships did shadow vynes, the which the floud did hide. \n And where but tother day before did feede the hungry Gote, \n The ugly Seales and Porkepisces now to and fro did flote. \n The Sea nymphes wondred under waves the townes and groves to see, \n And Dolphines playd among the tops and boughes of every tree. \n The grim and greedy Wolfe did swim among the siely sheepe, \n The Lion and the Tyger fierce were borne upon the deepe. \n It booted not the foming Boare his crooked tuskes to whet, \n The running Hart coulde in the streame by swiftnesse nothing get. \n The fleeting fowles long having sought for land to rest upon, \n Into the Sea with werie wings were driven to fall anon. \n Th'outragious swelling of the Sea the lesser hillockes drownde, \n Unwonted waves on highest tops of mountaines did rebownde. \n The greatest part of men were drownde, and such as scapte the floode, \n Forlorne with fasting overlong did die for want of foode. \n Against the fieldes of Aonie and Atticke lies a lande \n That Phocis hight, a fertile ground while that it was a lande: \n But at that time a part of Sea, and even a champion fielde \n Of sodaine waters which the floud by forced rage did yeelde, \n Where as a hill with forked top the which Parnasus hight, \n Doth pierce the cloudes and to the starres doth raise his head upright. \n When at this hill (for yet the Sea had whelmed all beside) \n Deucalion and his bedfellow, without all other guide, \n Arrived in a little Barke immediatly they went, \n And to the Nymphes of Corycus with full devout intent \n Did honor due, and to the Gods to whome that famous hill \n Was sacred, and to Themis eke in whose most holie will \n Consisted then the Oracles. In all the world so rounde \n A better nor more righteous man could never yet be founde \n Than was Deucalion, nor againe a woman, mayde nor wife, \n That feared God so much as shee, nor led so good a life. \n When Jove behelde how all the worlde stoode lyke a plash of raine, \n And of so many thousand men and women did remaine \n But one of eche, howbeit those both just and both devout, \n He brake the Cloudes, and did commaund that Boreas with his stout \n And sturdie blasts should chase the floud, that Earth might see the skie \n And Heaven the Earth: the Seas also began immediatly \n Their raging furie for to cease. Their ruler laide awaye \n His dreadfull Mace, and with his wordes their woodnesse did alaye.\n\n \n",
            "5":"\n\n He called Tryton to him straight, his trumpetter, who stoode \n In purple robe on shoulder cast, aloft upon the floode, \n And bade him take his sounding Trumpe and out of hand to blow \n Retreat, that all the streames might heare, and cease from thence to flow. \n He tooke his Trumpet in his hand, hys Trumpet was a shell \n Of some great Whelke or other fishe, in facion like a Bell \n That gathered narrow to the mouth, and as it did descende \n Did waxe more wide and writhen still, downe to the nether ende: \n When that this Trumpe amid the Sea was set to Trytons mouth, \n He blew so loude that all the streames both East, West, North and South, \n Might easly heare him blow retreate, and all that heard the sounde \n Immediatly began to ebbe and draw within their bounde. \n Then gan the Sea to have a shore, and brookes to finde a banke, \n And swelling streames of flowing flouds within hir chanels sanke. \n Then hils did rise above the waves that had them overflow, \n And as the waters did decrease the ground did seeme to grow. \n And after long and tedious time the trees did shew their tops \n All bare, save that upon the boughes the mud did hang in knops. \n The worlde restored was againe, which though Deucalion joyde \n Then to beholde: yet forbicause he saw the earth was voyde \n And silent like a wildernesse, with sad and weeping eyes \n And ruthfull voyce he then did speake to Pyrrha in this wise: \n O sister, O my loving spouse, O sielie woman left, \n As onely remnant of thy sexe that water hath bereft, \n Whome Nature first by right of birth hath linked to me fast \n In that we brothers children bene: and secondly the chast \n And stedfast bond of lawfull bed: and lastly now of all, \n The present perils of the time that latelye did befall. \n On all the Earth from East to West where Phebus shewes his face \n There is no moe but thou and I of all the mortall race. \n The Sea hath swallowed all the rest: and scarsly are we sure, \n That our two lives from dreadfull death in safetie shall endure. \n For even as yet the duskie cloudes doe make my heart adrad. \n Alas poore wretched sielie soule, what heart wouldst thou have had \n To beare these heavie happes, if chaunce had let thee scape alone? \n Who should have bene thy consort then: who should have rewd thy mone? \n Now trust me truly, loving wife, had thou as now bene drownde, \n I would have followde after thee and in the sea bene fownde. \n Would God I could my fathers Arte, of claye to facion men \n And give them life that people might frequent the world agen. \n Mankinde (alas) doth onely now wythin us two consist, \n As mouldes whereby to facion men. For so the Gods doe lyst. \n And with these words the bitter teares did trickle down their cheeke, \n Untill at length betweene themselves they did agree to seeke \n To God by prayer for his grace, and to demaund his ayde \n By aunswere of his Oracle. Wherein they nothing stayde, \n But to Cephisus sadly went, whose streame as at that time \n Began to run within his bankes though thicke with muddie slime, \n Whose sacred liquor straight they tooke and sprinkled with the same \n Their heads and clothes: and afterward to Themis chappell came, \n The roofe whereof with cindrie mosse was almost overgrowne. \n For since the time the raging floud the worlde had overflowne, \n No creature came within the Churche: so that the Altars stood \n Without one sparke of holie fyre or any sticke of wood. \n As soon as that this couple came within the chappell doore, \n They fell downe flat upon the ground, and trembling kist the floore. \n And sayde: If prayer that proceedes from humble heart and minde \n May in the presence of the Gods, such grace and favor finde \n As to appease their worthie wrath, then vouch thou safe to tell \n (O gentle Themis) how the losse that on our kinde befell, \n May now eftsoones recovered be, and helpe us to repaire \n The world, which drowned under waves doth lie in great dispaire. \n The Goddesse moved with their sute, this answere did them make: \n Depart you hence: Go hille your heads, and let your garmentes slake, \n And both of you your Graundames bones behind your shoulders cast. \n They stoode amazed at these wordes, tyll Pyrrha at the last, \n Refusing to obey the hest the which the Goddesse gave, \n Brake silence, and with trembling cheere did meekely pardon crave. \n For sure she saide she was afraide hir Graundames ghost to hurt \n By taking up hir buried bones to throw them in the durt. \n And with the aunswere here upon eftsoones in hand they go, \n The doubtfull wordes wherof they scan and canvas to and fro. \n Which done, Prometheus sonne began by counsell wise and sage \n His cousin germanes fearfulnesse thus gently to asswage: \n Well, eyther in these doubtfull words is hid some misterie, \n Whereof the Gods permit us not the meaning to espie, \n Or questionlesse and if the sence of inward sentence deeme \n Like as the tenour of the words apparantly doe seeme, \n It is no breach of godlynesse to doe as God doth bid. \n I take our Graundame for the earth, the stones within hir hid \n I take for bones, these are the bones the which are meaned here. \n Though Titans daughter at this wise conjecture of hir fere \n Were somewhat movde, yet none of both did stedfast credit geve, \n So hardly could they in their heartes the heavenly hestes beleve. \n But what and if they made a proufe? what harme could come thereby? \n They went their wayes and heild their heades, and did their cotes untie. \n And at their backes did throw the stones by name of bones foretolde. \n The stones (who would beleve the thing, but that the time of olde \n Reportes it for a stedfast truth?) of nature tough and harde, \n Began to warre both soft and smothe: and shortly afterwarde \n To winne therwith a better shape: and as they did encrease, \n A mylder nature in them grew, and rudenesse gan to cease. \n For at the first their shape was such, as in a certaine sort \n Resembled man, but of the right and perfect shape came short. \n Even like to Marble ymages new drawne and roughly wrought, \n Before the Carver by his Arte to purpose hath them brought. \n Such partes of them where any juice or moysture did abound, \n Or else were earthie, turned to flesh: and such as were so sound, \n And harde as would not bow nor bende did turne to bones: againe \n The part that was a veyne before, doth still his name retaine. \n Thus by the mightie powre of God ere lenger time was past, \n The mankinde was restorde by stones, the which a man did cast. \n And likewise also by the stones the which a woman threw, \n The womankinde repayred was and made againe of new. \n Of these are we the crooked ympes, and stonie race in deede, \n Bewraying by our toyling life, from whence we doe proceede.\n\n \n",
            "6":"\n\n The lustie earth of owne accorde soone after forth did bring \n According to their sundrie shapes eche other living thing, \n As soone as that the moysture once caught heate against the Sunne , \n And that the fat and slimie mud in moorish groundes begunne \n To swell through warmth of Phebus beames, and that the fruitfull seede \n Of things well cherisht in the fat and lively soyle in deede, \n As in their mothers wombe, began in length of time to grow, \n To one or other kinde of shape wherein themselves to show. \n Even so when that seven mouthed Nile the watrie fieldes forsooke, \n And to his auncient channel eft his bridled streames betooke, \n So that the Sunne did heate the mud, the which he left behinde, \n The husbandmen that tilde the ground, among the cloddes did finde \n Of sundrie creatures sundrie shapes: of which they spied some, \n Even in the instant of their birth but newly then begonne, \n And some unperfect, wanting brest or shoulders in such wise, \n That in one bodie oftentimes appeared to the eyes \n One halfe thereof alive to be, and all the rest beside \n Both voyde of life and seemely shape, starke earth to still abide. \n For when that moysture with the heate is tempred equally, \n They doe conceyve: and of them twaine engender by and by \n All kinde of things. For though that fire with water aye debateth \n Yet moysture mixt with equall heate all living things createth. \n And so those discordes in their kinde, one striving with the other, \n In generation doe agree and make one perfect mother. \n And therfore when the mirie earth bespred with slimie mud, \n Brought over all but late before by violence of the flud, \n Caught heate by warmnesse of the Sunne , and calmenesse of the skie, \n Things out of number in the worlde, forthwith it did applie. \n Whereof in part the like before in former times had bene, \n And some so straunge and ougly shapes as never erst were sene. \n In that she did such Monsters breede, was greatly to hir woe, \n But yet thou, ougly Python, wert engendred by hir thoe. \n A terror to the newmade folke, which never erst had knowne \n So foule a Dragon in their lyfe, so monstrously foregrowne; \n So great a ground thy poyson paunch did underneath thee hide. \n The God of shooting who no where before that present tide \n Those kinde of weapons put in ure, but at the speckled Deare, \n Or at the Roes so wight of foote, a thousand shaftes well neere, \n Did on that hideous serpent spende: of which there was not one, \n But forced forth the venimd bloud along his sydes to gone. \n So that his quiver almost voyde, he nailde him to the grounde, \n And did him nobly at the last by force of shot confounde. \n And least that time might of this worke deface the worthy fame, \n He did ordeyne in mynde thereof a great and solemne game, \n Which of the serpent that he slue of Pythians bare the name. \n Where who so could the maistrie winne in feates of strength, or sleight \n Of hande or foote or rolling wheele, might claime to have of right, \n An Oken garland fresh and brave. There was not any wheare \n As yet a Bay: by meanes whereof was Phebus faine to weare \n The leaves of every pleasant tree about his golden heare. \n",

It were a better sight, \n To see this kinde of furniture on my two shoulders bright: \n Who when we list with stedfast hand both man and beast can wound, \n Who tother day wyth arrowes keene, have nayled to the ground \n The serpent Python so forswolne, whose filthie wombe did hide \n So many acres of the grounde in which he did abide. \n Content thy selfe sonne, sorie loves to kindle with thy brand, \n For these our prayses to attaine thou must not take in hand. \n To him quoth Venus sonne againe, well Phebus I agree \n Thy bow to shoote at every beast, and so shall mine at thee \n And looke how far that under God eche beast is put by kinde, \n So much thy glorie lesse than ours in shooting shalt thou finde. \n This saide, with drift of fethered wings in broken ayre he flue, \n And to the forkt and shadie top of Mount Parnasus drue. \n There from hys quiver full of shafts two arrowes did he take \n Of sundrie workes: t'one causeth Love, the tother doth it slake. \n That causeth love, is all of golde with point full sharpe and bright, \n That chaseth love is blunt, whose stele with leaden head is dight. \n The God this fired in the Nymph Peneis for the nones: \n The tother perst Apollos heart and overraft his bones. \n Immediatly in smoldring heate of Love the t'one did swelt, \n Againe the tother in hir heart no sparke nor motion felt. \n In woods and forrests is hir joy, the savage beasts to chase, \n And as the price of all hir paine to take the skinne and case. \n Unwedded Phebe doth she haunt and follow as hir guide, \n Unordred doe hir tresses wave scarce in a fillet tide. \n Full many a wooer sought hir love, she lothing all the rout, \n Impacient and without a man walkes all the woods about. \n And as for Hymen, or for love, and wedlocke often sought \n She tooke no care, they were the furthest end of all hir thought. \n Hir father many a time and oft would saye: My daughter deere, \n Thow owest me a sonneinlaw to be thy lawfull feere. \n Hir father many a time and oft would say: My daughter deere, \n Of Nephewes thou my debtour art, their Graundsires heart to cheere. \n She hating as a haynous crime the bonde of bridely bed \n Demurely casting downe hir eyes, and blushing somwhat red, \n Did folde about hir fathers necke with fauning armes: and sed: \n Deare father, graunt me while I live my maidenhead for to have, \n As to Diana here tofore hir father freely gave. \n Thy father ( Daphne ) could consent to that thou doest require, \n But that thy beautie and thy forme impugne thy chaste desire: \n So that thy will and his consent are nothing in this case, \n By reason of the beautie bright that shineth in thy face. \n Apollo loves and longs to have this Daphne to his Feere, \n And as he longs he hopes, but his foredoomes doe fayle him there. \n And as light hame when corne is reapt, or hedges burne with brandes, \n That passers by when day drawes neere throwe loosely fro their handes, \n So into flames the God is gone and burneth in his brest \n And feedes his vaine and barraine love in hoping for the best. \n Hir haire unkembd about hir necke downe flaring did he see, \n O Lord and were they trimd (quoth he) how seemely would she bee? \n He sees hir eyes as bright as fire the starres to represent, \n He sees hir mouth which to have seene he holdes him not content. \n Hir lillie armes mid part and more above the elbow bare, \n Hir handes, hir fingers and hir wrystes, him thought of beautie rare. \n And sure he thought such other parts as garments then did hyde, \n Excelled greatly all the rest the which he had espyde. \n But swifter than the whyrling winde shee flees and will not stay, \n To give the hearing to these wordes the which he had to say: \n I pray thee Nymph Penaeis stay, I chase not as a fo: \n Stay Nymph: the Lambes so flee the Wolves, the Stags the Lions so. \n With flittring feathers sielie Doves so from the Gossehauke flie, \n And every creature from his foe. Love is the cause that I \n Do followe thee: alas alas how would it grieve my heart, \n To see thee fall among the briers, and that the bloud should start \n Out of thy tender legges, I, wretch, the causer of thy smart. \n The place is rough to which thou runst, take leysure I thee pray, \n Abate thy flight, and I my selfe my running pace will stay. \n Yet would I wishe thee take advise, and wisely for to viewe \n What one he is that for thy grace in humble wise doth sewe. \n I am not one that dwelles among the hilles and stonie rockes, \n I am no sheepehearde with a Curre, attending on the flockes: \n I am no Carle nor countrie Clowne, nor neathearde taking charge \n Of cattle grazing here and there within this Forrest large. \n Thou doest not know, poore simple soule, God wote thou dost not knowe, \n From whome thou fleest.

He made no long abod, \n But tyde his feathers to his feete, and tooke his charmed rod. \n (With which he bringeth things asleepe, and fetcheth soules from Hell) \n And put his Hat upon his head: and when that all was well \n He leaped from his fathers towres, and downe to earth he flue \n And there both Hat and winges also he lightly from him thrue, \n Retayning nothing but his staffe, the which he closely helde \n Betweene his elbowe and his side, and through the common fielde \n Went plodding lyke some good plaine soule that had some flocke to feede. \n And as he went he pyped still upon an Oten Reede. \n Queene Junos Heirdman farre in love with this straunge melodie \n Bespake him thus: Good fellow mine, I pray thee heartely \n Come sitte downe by me on this hill, for better feede I knowe \n Thou shalt not finde in all these fieldes, and (as the thing doth showe) \n It is a coole and shadowie plot, for sheepeheirds verie fitte. \n Downe by his elbow by and by did Atlas nephew sit. \n And for to passe the tyme withall for seeming overlong, \n He helde him talke of this and that, and now and than among \n He playd upon his merrie Pipe to cause his watching eyes \n To fall asleepe. Poore Argus did the best he could devise \n To overcome the pleasant nappes: and though that some did sleepe, \n Yet of his eyes the greater part he made their watch to keepe. \n And after other talke he askt (for lately was it founde) \n Who was the founder of that Pype that did so sweetely sounde. \n Then sayde the God: There dwelt sometime a Nymph of noble fame \n Among the hilles of Arcadie , that Syrinx had to name. \n Of all the Nymphes of Nonacris and Fairie farre and neere, \n In beautie and in personage thys Ladie had no peere. \n Full often had she given the slippe both to the Satyrs quicke \n And other Gods that dwell in Woods, and in the Forrests thicke, \n Or in the fruitfull fieldes abrode: It was hir whole desire \n To follow chaste Dianas guise in Maydenhead and attire, \n Whome she did counterfaite so nighe, that such as did hir see \n Might at a blush have taken hir Diana for to bee, \n But that the Nymph did in hir hande a bowe of Cornell holde, \n Whereas Diana evermore did beare a bowe of golde. \n And yet she did deceyve folke so. Upon a certaine day \n God Pan with garland on his heade of Pinetree, sawe hir stray \n From Mount Lyceus all alone, and thus to hir did say: \n Unto a Gods request, O Nymph, voucesafe thou to agree \n That doth desire thy wedded spouse and husband for to bee. \n There was yet more behinde to tell: as how that Syrinx fled, \n Through waylesse woods and gave no eare to that that Pan had sed, \n Untill she to the gentle streame of sandie Ladon came, \n Where, for bicause it was so deepe, she could not passe the same, \n She piteously to chaunge hir shape the water Nymphes besought: \n And how when Pan betweene his armes, to catch the Nymph had thought, \n In steade of hir he caught the Reedes newe growne upon the brooke, \n And as he sighed, with his breath the Reedes he softly shooke \n Which made a still and mourning noyse, with straungnesse of the which \n And sweetenesse of the feeble sounde the God delighted mich, \n Saide: Certesse, Syrinx, for thy sake it is my full intent, \n To make my comfort of these Reedes wherein thou doest lament: \n And how that there of sundrie Reedes with wax together knit, \n He made the Pipe which of hir name the Greekes call Syrinx yet.\n\n \n",
            "11":"\n\n But as Cyllenius would have tolde this tale, he cast his sight \n On Argus, and beholde his eyes had bid him all good night. \n There was not one that did not sleepe, and fast he gan to nodde, \n Immediately he ceast his talke, and with his charmed rodde, \n So stroked all his heavie eyes that earnestly they slept. \n Then with his Woodknife by and by he lightly to him stept, \n And lent him such a perlous blowe, where as the shoulders grue \n Unto the necke, that straight his heade quite from the bodie flue. \n Then tombling downe the headlong hill his bloudie coarse he sent, \n That all the way by which he rolde was stayned and besprent. \n There lyest thou Argus under foote, with all thy hundreth lights, \n And all the light is cleane extinct that was within those sights. \n One endelesse night thy hundred eyes hath nowe bereft for aye, \n Yet would not Juno suffer so hir Heirdmans eyes decay: \n But in hir painted Peacocks tayle and feathers did them set, \n Where they remayne lyke precious stones and glaring eyes as yet. \n She tooke his death in great dispight and as hir rage did move, \n Determinde for to wreeke hir wrath upon hir husbandes Love. \n Forthwith she cast before hir eyes right straunge and ugly sightes, \n Compelling hir to thinke she sawe some Fiendes or wicked sprightes. \n And in hir heart such secret prickes and piercing stings she gave hir, \n As through the worlde from place to place with restlesse sorrow drave hir. \n Thou Nylus wert assignd to stay hir paynes and travails past, \n To which as soone as Io came with much adoe at last, \n With wearie knockles on thy brim she kneeled sadly downe, \n And stretching foorth hir faire long necke and christall horned crowne, \n Such kinde of countnaunce as she had she lifted to the skie, \n And there with sighing sobbes and teares and lowing doolefully \n Did seeme to make hir mone to Jove, desiring him to make \n Some ende of those hir troublous stormes endured for his sake. \n He tooke his wife about the necke, and sweetely kissing prayde, \n That Ios penance yet at length might by hir graunt be stayde. \n Thou shalt not neede to feare (quoth he) that ever she shall grieve thee \n From this day forth. And in this case the better to beleve mee, \n The Stygian waters of my wordes unparciall witnesse beene. \n As soone as Juno was appeasde, immediately was seene \n That Io tooke hir native shape in which she first was borne, \n And eke became the selfesame thing the which she was beforne. \n For by and by she cast away hir rough and hairie hyde, \n Insteede whereof a soft smouth skinne with tender fleshe did byde. \n Hir hornes sank down, hir eies and mouth were brought in lesser roome, \n Hir handes, hir shoulders, and hir armes in place againe did come. \n Hir cloven Clees to fingers five againe reduced were, \n On which the nayles lyke pollisht Gemmes did shine full bright and clere. \n In fine, no likenesse of a Cow save whitenesse did remaine \n So pure and perfect as no snow was able it to staine. \n She vaunst hir selfe upon hir feete which then was brought to two. \n And though she gladly would have spoke: yet durst she not so do, \n Without good heede, for feare she should have lowed like a Cow. \n And therefore softly with hir selfe she gan to practise how \n Distinctly to pronounce hir wordes that intermitted were.\n\n \n",

This noble ympe nowe joyntly with his mother, \n Through all the Cities of that lande have temples t'one with toother. \n There was his match in heart and yeares, the lustie Phaeton, \n A stalworth stripling strong and stout, the golden Phoebus sonne. \n Whome making proude and stately vauntes of his so noble race, \n And unto him in that respect in nothing giving place, \n The sonne of Io coulde not beare: but sayde unto him thus: \n No marvell though thou be so proude and full of wordes ywus. \n For everie fonde and trifling tale the which thy mother makes, \n Thy gyddie wit and hairebrainde heade forthwith for gospell takes. \n Well, vaunt thy selfe of Phoebus still, for when the truth is seene, \n Thou shalt perceyve that fathers name a forged thing to beene. \n At this reproch did Phaeton wax as red as any fire: \n Howbeit for the present tyme did shame represse his ire. \n Unto his mother Clymen straight he goeth to detect \n The spitefull wordes that Epaphus against him did object. \n Yes mother (quoth he) and which ought your greater griefe to bee, \n I who at other tymes of talke was wont to be so free \n And stoute, had neere a worde to say, I was ashamde to take \n So fowle a foyle: the more because I could none answere make. \n But if I be of heavenly race exacted as ye say, \n Then shewe some token of that highe and noble byrth I pray. \n And vouche me for to be of heaven. With that he gently cast \n His armes about his mothers necke, and clasping hir full fast, \n Besought hir as she lovde his life, and as she lovde the lyfe \n Of Merops, and had kept hir selfe as undefiled wyfe, \n And as she wished welthily his sisters to bestowe, \n She would some token give whereby his rightfull Sire to knowe. \n It is a doubtful matter whither Clymen moved more \n With this hir Phaetons earnest sute, exacting it so sore, \n Or with the slaunder of the bruit layde to hir charge before, \n Did holde up both hir handes to heaven, and looking on the Sunne , \n My right deare childe I safely sweare (quoth she to Phaeton) \n That of this starre the which so bright doth glister in thine eye: \n Of this same Sunne that cheares the world with light indifferently \n Wert thou begot: and if I fayne, then with my heart I pray, \n That never may I see him more unto my dying day. \n But if thou have so great desire thy father for to knowe, \n Thou shalt not neede in that behalfe much labour to bestowe. \n The place from whence he doth arise adjoyneth to our lande. \n And if thou thinke thy heart will serve, then go and understande \n The truth of him. When Phaeton heard his mother saying so, \n He gan to leape and skip for joye. He fed his fansie tho, \n Upon the Heaven and heavenly things: and so with willing minde, \n From Aethiop first his native home, and afterwarde through Inde \n Set underneath the morning starre he went so long, till as \n He founde me where his fathers house and dayly rising was. \n"

For there a perfect plat \n Had Vulcane drawne of all the worlde: Both of the sourges that \n Embrace the earth with winding waves, and of the stedfast ground, \n And of the heaven it selfe also that both encloseth round. \n And first and formest in the Sea the Gods thereof did stande: \n Loude sounding Tryton with his shirle and writhen Trumpe in hande: \n Unstable Protew chaunging aye his figure and his hue, \n From shape to shape a thousande sithes as list him to renue: \n Aegeon leaning boystrously on backes of mightie Whales \n And Doris with hir daughters all: of which some cut the wales \n With splaied armes, some sate on rockes and dride their goodly haire, \n And some did ryde uppon the backes of fishes here and theare. \n Not one in all poyntes fully lyke an other coulde ye see, \n Nor verie farre unlike, but such as sisters ought to bee. \n The Earth had townes, men, beasts and Woods with sundrie trees and rods, \n And running Ryvers with their Nymphes and other countrie Gods. \n Directly over all these same the plat of heaven was pight, \n Upon the two doore leaves, the signes of all the Zodiak bright, \n Indifferently six on the left and six upon the right. \n When Clymens sonne had climbed up at length with weerie pace, \n And set his foote within his doubted fathers dwelling place, \n Immediately he preaced forth to put him selfe in sight, \n And stoode aloofe. For neere at hande he could not bide the light. \n In purple Robe and royall Throne of Emeraudes freshe and greene \n Did Phoebus sitte, and on eche hande stoode wayting well beseene, \n Dayes, Monthes, yeares, ages, seasons, times, and eke the equall houres. \n There stoode the springtime with a crowne of fresh and fragrant floures. \n There wayted Sommer naked starke all save a wheaten Hat: \n And Autumne smerde with treading grapes late at the pressing Vat. \n And lastly quaking for the colde, stood Winter all forlorne, \n With rugged heade as white as Dove, and garments all to torne, \n Forladen with the Isycles that dangled up and downe \n Uppon his gray and hoarie bearde and snowie frozen crowne. \n The Sunne thus sitting in the middes did cast his piercing eye, \n (With which full lightly when he list he all thinges doth espye) \n Upon his childe that stood aloofe, agast and trembling sore \n At sight of such unwonted things, and thus bespake him thore: \n O noble ympe, O Phaeton which art not such (I see) \n Of whome thy father should have cause ashamed for to bee: \n Why hast thou traveld to my court? what is thy will with mee? \n Then answerde he: Of all the worlde O onely perfect light, \n O Father Phoebus, (if I may usurpe that name of right, \n And that my mother for to save hir selfe from worldely shame, \n Hyde not hir fault with false pretence and colour of thy name) \n Some signe apparant graunt whereby I may be knowne thy Sonne, \n And let mee hang no more in doubt. He had no sooner donne, \n But that his father putting off the bright and fierie beames \n That glistred rounde about his heade like cleare and golden streames, \n Commaunded him to draw him neere, and him embracing sayde: \n To take mee for thy rightfull Sire thou neede not be afrayde. \n Thy mother Clymen of a truth from falshood standeth free. \n And for to put thee out of doubt aske what thou wilt of mee, \n And I will give thee thy desire, the Lake whereby of olde \n We Gods do sweare (the which mine eyes did never yet beeholde) \n Beare witnesse with thee of my graunt. He scarce this tale had tolde, \n But that the foolish Phaeton straight for a day did crave \n The guyding of his winged Steedes, and Chariot for to have. \n Then did his Father by and by forethinke him of his oth. \n And shaking twentie tymes his heade, as one that was full wroth, \n Bespake him thus: Thy wordes have made me rashly to consent \n To that which shortly both of us (I feare mee) shall repent. \n Oh that I might retract my graunt, my sonne I doe protest \n I would denie thee nothing else save this thy fond request. \n I may disswade, there lyes herein more perill than thou weene: \n The things the which thou doest desire of great importance beene: \n More than thy weakenesse well can wielde, a charge (as well appeares) \n Of greater weight, than may agree with these thy tender yeares. \n Thy state is mortall, weake and frayle, the thing thou doest desire \n Is such, whereto no mortall man is able to aspire. \n Yea, foolish boy, thou doest desire (and all for want of wit) \n A greater charge than any God coulde ever have as yet. \n For were there any of them all so overseene and blinde, \n To take upon him this my charge, full quickly should he finde \n That none but I could sit upon the fierie Axeltree. \n No not even he that rules this wast and endlesse space we see, \n Not he that darts with dreadfull hande the thunder from the Skie, \n Shall drive this chare. And yet what thing in all the world perdie \n Is able to compare with Jove? Now first the morning way \n Lyes steepe upright, so that the steedes in coolest of the day \n And beeing fresh have much adoe to climbe against the Hyll. \n Amiddes the heaven the gastly heigth augmenteth terror still. \n My heart doth waxe as colde as yse full many a tyme and oft \n For feare to see the Sea and land from that same place aloft. \n The Evening way doth fall plump downe requiring strength to guide, \n That Tethis who doth harbrowgh mee within hir sourges wide \n Doth stand in feare lest from the heaven I headlong down should slide. \n Besides all this the Heaven aye swimmes and wheeles about full swift \n And with his rolling dryves the starres their proper course to shift. \n Yet doe I keepe my native course against this brunt so stout, \n Not giving place as others doe: but boldely bearing out \n The force and swiftnesse of that heaven that whyrleth so about. \n Admit thou had my winged Steedes and Chariot in thine hande: \n What couldste thou doe? dost thinke thy selfe well able to withstande \n The swiftnesse of the whyrled Poles, but that their brunt and sway \n (Yea doe the best and worst thou can) shall beare thee quite away? \n Perchaunce thou dost imagine there some townes of Gods to finde, \n With groves and Temples richt with giftes as is among mankinde. \n Thou art deceyved utterly: thou shalt not finde it so. \n By blinde bywayes and ugly shapes of monsters must thou go. \n And though thou knewe the way so well as that thou could not stray, \n Betweene the dreadful bulles sharp hornes yet must thou make thy way. \n Agaynst the cruell Bowe the which the Aemonian archer drawes: \n Against the ramping Lyon armde with greedie teeth and pawes: \n Against the Scorpion stretching farre his fell and venymd clawes: \n And eke the Crab that casteth forth his crooked clees awrie \n Not in such sort as th'other doth, and yet as dreadfully. \n Againe thou neyther hast the powre nor yet the skill I knowe \n My lustie coursers for to guide that from their nostrilles throwe \n And from their mouthes the fierie breath that breedeth in their brest. \n For scarcely will they suffer mee who knowes their nature best \n When that their cruell courages begin to catch a heate, \n That hardely should I deale with them, but that I know the feate. \n But lest my gift should to thy griefe and utter perill tend \n My Sonne beware and (whyle thou mayst) thy fonde request amend. \n Bycause thou woulde be knowne to bee my childe thou seemst to crave \n A certaine signe: what surer signe I pray thee canst thou have \n Than this my feare so fatherly the which I have of thee \n Which proveth me most certainly thy father for to bee? \n Beholde and marke my countenaunce. would to God thy sight \n Could pierce within my wofull brest, to see the heavie plight, \n And heapes of cares within my heart.

This onely one request \n That thou hast made I heartely beseech thee to relent, \n Which for to tearme the thing aright is even a punishment, \n And not an honour as thou thinkest: my Phaeton thou dost crave \n In stead of honour even a scourge and punishment for to have. \n Thou fondling thou, what dost thou meane with fawning armes about \n My necke thus flattringly to hang?

For be thou sure, \n And if thou mount above thy boundes, the starres thou burnest cleane. \n Againe beneath thou burnst the Earth: most safetie is the meane. \n And least perchaunce thou overmuch the right hand way should take, \n And so misfortune should thee drive upon the writhen Snake, \n Or else by taking overmuche upon the lefter hand \n Unto the Aultar thou be driven that doth against it stand: \n Indifferently betweene them both I wish thee for to ride. \n The rest I put to fortunes will, who be thy friendly guide, \n And better for thee than thy selfe as in this case provide. \n Whiles that I prattle here with thee, behold the dankish night \n Beyond all Spaine hir utmost bound is passed out of sight. \n We may no lenger tariance make: my wonted light is cald, \n The Morning with hir countnance cleare the darknesse hath appald. \n Take raine in hand, or if thy minde by counsell altred bee, \n Refuse to meddle with my Wayne: and while thou yet art free, \n And doste at ease within my house in safegarde well remaine, \n Of this thine unadvised wish not feeling yet the paine, \n Let me alone with giving still the world his wonted light, \n And thou thereof as heretofore enjoy the harmelesse sight. \n Thus much in vaine: for Phaeton both yong in yeares and wit, \n Into the Chariot lightly lept, and vauncing him in it \n Was not a little proud that he the brydle gotten had. \n He thankt his father whom it grievde to see his childe so mad. \n While Phebus and his rechelesse sonne were entertalking this, \n Aeous, Aethon, Phlegon, and the firie Pyrois, \n The restlesse horses of the Sunne, began to ney so hie \n Wyth flaming breath, that all the heaven might heare them perfectly. \n And with their hoves they mainly beate upon the lattisde grate. \n The which when Tethis (knowing nought of this hir cousins fate) \n Had put aside, and given the steedes the free and open scope \n Of all the compasse of the Skie within the heavenly Cope: \n They girded forth, and cutting through the Cloudes that let their race, \n With splayed wings they overflew the Easterne winde apace. \n The burthen was so lyght as that the Genets felt it not. \n The wonted weight was from the Waine, the which they well did wot. \n For like as ships amids the Seas that scant of ballace have, \n Doe reele and totter with the wynde, and yeeld to every wave: \n Even so the Waine for want of weight it erst was wont to beare, \n Did hoyse aloft and scayle and reele, as though it empty were. \n Which when the Cartware did perceyve, they left the beaten way \n And taking bridle in the teeth began to run astray. \n The rider was so sore agast, he knew no use of Rayne , \n Nor yet his way: and though he had, yet had it ben in vayne, \n Because he wanted powre to rule the horses and the Wayne . \n Then first did sweat cold Charles his Wain through force of Phebus rayes \n And in the Sea forbidden him, to dive in vaine assayes. \n The Serpent at the frozen Pole both colde and slow by kinde, \n Through heat waxt wroth, and stird about a cooler place to finde. \n And thou Bootes though thou be but slow of footemanship, \n Yet wert thou faine (as Fame reports) about thy Waine to skip. \n Now when unhappy Phaeton from top of all the Skie \n Behelde the Earth that underneath a great way off did lie, \n He waxed pale for sodaine feare, his joynts and sinewes quooke, \n The greatnesse of the glistring light his eyesight from him tooke. \n Now wisht he that he never had his fathers horses see: \n It yrkt him that he thus had sought to learne his piedegre. \n It grievde him that he had prevailde in gaining his request. \n To have bene counted Merops sonne he thought it now the best. \n Thus thinking was he headlong driven, as when a ship is borne \n By blustring windes, hir saileclothes rent, hir sterne in pieces torne, \n And tacling brust, the which the Pilote trusting all to prayre \n Abandons wholy to the Sea and fortune of the ayre. \n What should he doe? much of the heaven he passed had behinde \n And more he saw before: both whiche he measurde in his minde, \n Eft looking forward to the West which to approch as then \n Might not betide, and to the East eft looking backe agen. \n He wist not what was best to doe, his wittes were ravisht so. \n For neither could he hold the Reynes, nor yet durst let them go. \n And of his horses names was none that he remembred tho. \n Straunge uncoth Monsters did he see dispersed here and there \n And dreadfull shapes of ugly beasts that in the Welkin were.\n\n \n",

One while they coursing went \n Upon the top of all the skie: anon againe full round \n They troll me downe to lower wayes and nearer to the ground, \n So that the Moone was in a Maze to see hir brothers Waine \n Run under hirs: the singed cloudes began to smoke amaine. \n Eche ground the higher that it was and nearer to the Skie \n The sooner was it set on fire, and made therewith so drie \n That every where it gan to chinke. The Medes and Pastures greene \n Did seare away: and with the leaves, the trees were burned cleene. \n The parched corne did yeelde wherewith to worke his owne decaie. \n Tushe, these are trifles. Mightie townes did perish that same daie. \n Whose countries with their folke were burnt: and forests ful of wood \n Were turnde to ashes with the rocks and mountains where they stood. \n Then Athe, Cilician, Taure and Tmole and Oeta flamed hie, \n And Ide erst full of flowing springs was then made utter drie. \n The learned virgins daily haunt, the sacred Helicon , \n And Thracian Hemus (not as yet surnamde Oeagrion,) \n Did smoke both twaine: and Aetna hote of nature aye before, \n Encreast by force of Phebus flame now raged ten times more. \n The forkt Parnasus, Eryx , Cynth, and Othrys then did swelt \n And all the snow of Rhodope did at that present melt. \n The like outrage Mount Dindymus, and Mime and Micale felt. \n Cytheron borne to sacred use with Osse , and Pindus hie \n And Olymp greater than them both did burne excessively. \n The passing colde that Scithie had defended not the same \n But that the barren Caucasus was partner of this flame. \n And so were eke the Airie Alpes and Appennyne beside, \n For all the Cloudes continually their snowie tops doe hide. \n Then wheresoever Phaeton did chaunce to cast his vew, \n The world was all on flaming fire. The breath the which he drew, \n Came smoking from his scalding mouth as from a seething pot. \n His Chariot also under him began to waxe red hot. \n He could no lenger dure the sparkes and cinder flyeng out, \n Againe the culme and smouldring smoke did wrap him round about, \n The pitchie darkenesse of the which so wholy had him hent \n As that he wist not where he was nor yet which way he went. \n The winged horses forcibly did draw him where they wolde. \n The Aethiopians at that time (as men for truth upholde) \n (The bloud by force of that same heate drawne to the outer part \n And there adust from that time forth) became so blacke and swart. \n The moysture was so dried up in Lybie land that time \n That altogither drie and scorcht continueth yet that Clyme. \n The Nymphes with haire about their eares bewayld their springs and lakes. \n Beotia for hir Dyrces losse great lamentation makes. \n For Amimone Argos wept, and Corinth for the spring \n Pyrene, at whose sacred streame the Muses usde to sing. \n The Rivers further from the place were not in better case, \n For Tanais in his deepest streame did boyle and steme apace, \n Old Penew and Caycus of the countrie Teuthranie, \n And swift Ismenos in their bankes by like misfortune frie. \n Then burnde the Psophian Erymanth: and (which should burne ageine) \n The Trojan Xanthus and Lycormas with his yellow veine, \n Meander playing in his bankes aye winding to and fro, \n Migdonian Melas with his waves as blacke as any slo. \n Eurotas running by the foote of Tenare boyled tho. \n Then sod Euphrates cutting through the middes of Babilon. \n Then sod Orontes, and the Scithian swift Thermodoon. \n Then Ganges, Colchian Phasis, and the noble Istre \n Alpheus and Sperchius bankes with flaming fire did glistre. \n The golde that Tagus streame did beare did in the chanell melt. \n Amid Cayster of this fire the raging heat was felt \n Among the quieres of singing Swannes that with their pleasant lay \n Along the bankes of Lidian brakes from place to place did stray. \n And Nyle for feare did run away into the furthest Clyme \n Of all the world, and hid his heade, which to this present tyme \n Is yet unfound: his mouthes all seven cleane voyde of water beene, \n Like seven great valleys where (save dust) could nothing else be seene. \n By like misfortune Hebrus dride and Strymon, both of Thrace . \n The Westerne Rivers Rhine and Rhone and Po were in like case: \n And Tyber unto whome the Goddes a faithfull promise gave \n Of all the world the Monarchie and soveraigne state to have. \n The ground did cranie everie where and light did pierce to hell \n And made afraide the King and Queene that in that Realme doe dwell. \n The Sea did shrinke and where as waves did late before remaine, \n Became a Champion field of dust and even a sandy plaine. \n The hilles erst hid farre under waves like Ilelandes did appeare \n So that the scattred Cyclades for the time augmented were. \n The fishes drew them to the deepes: the Dolphines durst not play \n Above the water as before, the Seales and Porkpis lay \n With bellies upward on the waves starke dead: and fame doth go \n That Nereus with his wife and daughters all were faine as tho \n To dive within the scalding waves.

His shoulders though full strong, \n Unneth are able to uphold the sparkling Extree long. \n If Sea and Land doe go to wrecke, and heaven it selfe doe burne \n To olde confused Chaos then of force we must returne. \n Put to thy helping hand therfore to save the little left \n If ought remaine before that all be quite and cleane bereft.\n\n \n",
            "3":"\n\n When ended was this piteous plaint, the Earth did hold hir peace. \n She could no lenger dure the heate but was compelde to cease. \n Into hir bosome by and by she shrunke hir cinged heade \n More nearer to the Stygian caves, and ghostes of persones deade. \n The Sire of Heaven protesting all the Gods and him also \n That lent the Chariot to his child, that all of force must go \n To havocke if he helped not, went to the highest part \n And top of all the Heaven from whence his custome was to dart \n His thunder and his lightning downe. But neyther did remaine \n A Cloude wherewith to shade the Earth, nor yet a showre of raine. \n Then with a dreadfull thunderclap up to his eare he bent \n His fist, and at the Wagoner a flash of lightning sent, \n Which strake his bodie from the life and threw it over wheele \n And so with fire he quenched fire. The Steedes did also reele \n Upon their knees, and starting up sprang violently, one here, \n And there another, that they brast in pieces all their gere. \n They threw the Collars from their neckes, and breaking quite asunder \n The Trace and Harnesse flang away: here lay the bridles: yonder \n The Extree plucked from the Naves: and in another place \n The shevered spokes of broken wheeles: and so at every pace \n The pieces of the Chariot torne lay strowed here and there. \n But Phaeton (fire yet blasing stil among his yellow haire) \n Shot headlong downe, and glid along the Region of the Ayre \n Like to a starre in Winter nights (the wether cleare and fayre) \n Which though it doe not fall in deede, yet falleth to our sight, \n Whome almost in another world and from his countrie quite \n The River Padus did receyve, and quencht his burning head. \n The water Nymphes of Italie did take his carkasse dead \n And buried it yet smoking still, with Joves threeforked flame, \n And wrate this Epitaph in the stone that lay upon the same: \n Here lies the lusty Phaeton which tooke in hand to guide \n His fathers Chariot, from the which although he chaunst to slide: \n Yet that he gave a proud attempt it cannot be denide. \n Wyth ruthfull cheere and heavie heart his father made great mone \n And would not shew himselfe abrode, but mournd at home alone. \n And if it be to be beleved, as bruited is by fame \n A day did passe without the Sunne . The brightnesse of the flame \n Gave light: and so unto some kinde of use that mischiefe came. \n But Clymen having spoke, as much as mothers usually \n Are wonted in such wretched case, discomfortablely, \n And halfe beside hir selfe for wo, with torne and scratched brest, \n Sercht through the universall world, from East to furthest West, \n First seeking for hir sonnes dead coarse, and after for his bones. \n She found them by a forren streame, entumbled under stones. \n There fell she groveling on his grave, and reading there his name, \n Shed teares thereon, and layd hir breast all bare upon the same. \n The daughters also of the Sunne no lesse than did their mother, \n Bewaild in vaine with flouds of teares, the fortune of their brother: \n And beating piteously their breasts, incessantly did call \n The buried Phaeton day and night, who heard them not at all, \n About whose tumbe they prostrate lay. Foure times the Moone had filde \n The Circle of hir joyned hornes, and yet the sisters hilde \n Their custome of lamenting still: (for now continuall use \n Had made it custome.) Of the which the eldest, Phaetuse, \n About to kneele upon the ground, complaynde hir feete were nom. \n To whome as fayre Lampetie was rising for to com, \n Hir feete were held with sodaine rootes. The third about to teare \n Hir ruffled lockes, filde both hir handes with leaves in steade of heare. \n One wept to see hir legges made wood: another did repine \n To see hir armes become long boughes. And shortly to define, \n While thus they wondred at themselves, a tender barke began \n To grow about their thighes and loynes, which shortly overran \n Their bellies, brestes, and shoulders eke, and hands successively, \n That nothing (save their mouthes) remainde, aye calling piteously \n Upon the wofull mothers helpe. What could the mother doe \n But runne now here now there, as force of nature drue hir to \n And deale hir kisses while she might? She was not so content: \n But tare their tender braunches downe: and from the slivers went \n Red drops of bloud as from a wound. The daughter that was rent \n Cride: Spare us mother spare I pray, for in the shape of tree \n The bodies and the flesh of us your daughters wounded bee. \n And now farewell. That word once said, the barke grew over all. \n Now from these trees flow gummy teares that Amber men doe call, \n Which hardened with the heate of sunne as from the boughs they fal \n The trickling River doth receyve, and sendes as things of price \n To decke the daintie Dames of Rome and make them fine and nice. \n Now present at this monstruous hap was Cygnus, Stenels son, \n Who being by the mothers side akinne to Phaeton \n Was in condicion more akinne. He leaving up his charge \n (For in the land of Ligurie his Kingdome stretched large) \n Went mourning all along the bankes and pleasant streame of Po \n Among the trees encreased by the sisters late ago. \n Annon his voyce became more small and shrill than for a man. \n Gray fethers muffled in his face: his necke in length began \n Far from his shoulders for to stretche: and furthermore there goes \n A fine red string acrosse the joyntes in knitting of his toes: \n With fethers closed are his sides: and on his mouth there grew \n A brode blunt byll: and finally was Cygnus made a new \n And uncoth fowle that hight a Swan, who neither to the winde, \n The Ayre, nor Jove betakes himselfe, as one that bare in minde \n The wrongfull fire sent late against his cousin Phaeton. \n In Lakes and Rivers is his joy: the fire he aye doth shon, \n And chooseth him the contrary continually to won. \n Forlorne and altogether voyde of that same bodie shene \n Was Phaetons father in that while which erst had in him bene, \n Like as he looketh in Th'eclypse. He hates the yrkesome light, \n He hates him selfe, he hates the day, and settes his whole delight \n In making sorrow for his sonne, and in his griefe doth storme - \n And chaufe denying to the worlde his dutie to performe. \n My lot (quoth he) hath had inough of this unquiet state \n From first beginning of the worlde. It yrkes me (though too late) \n Of restlesse toyles and thankelesse paines. Let who so will for me \n Go drive the Chariot in the which the light should caried be. \n If none dare take the charge in hand, and all the Gods persist \n As insufficient, he himselfe go drive it if he list, \n That at the least by venturing our bridles for to guide \n His lightning making childlesse Sires he once may lay aside. \n By that time that he hath assayde the unappalled force \n That doth remaine and rest within my firiefooted horse, \n I trow he shall by tried proufe be able for to tell \n How that he did not merit death that could not rule them well. \n The Goddes stoode all about the Sunne thus storming in his rage \n Beseching him in humble wise his sorrow to asswage. \n And that he would not on the world continuall darkenesse bring, \n Jove eke excusde him of the fire the which he chaunst to sling, \n And with entreatance mingled threates as did become a King. \n Then Phebus gathered up his steedes that yet for feare did run \n Like flaighted fiendes, and in his moode without respect begun \n To beate his whipstocke on their pates and lash them on the sides. \n It was no neede to bid him chaufe; for ever as he rides \n He still upbraides them with his sonne, and layes them on the hides.\n\n \n",
            "4":"\n\n And Jove almighty went about the walles of heaven to trie \n If ought were perisht with the fire, which when he did espie \n Continuing in their former state, all strong and safe and sound, \n He went to vew the workes of men, and things upon the ground. \n Yet for his land of Arcadie he tooke most care and charge. \n The Springs and streames that durst not run he set againe at large. \n He clad the earth with grasse, the trees with leaves both fresh and greene \n Commaunding woods to spring againe that erst had burned bene. \n Now as he often went and came it was his chaunce to light \n Upon a Nymph of Nonacris whose forme and beautie bright \n Did set his heart on flaming fire. She used not to spinne \n Nor yet to curle hir frisled haire with bodkin or with pinne. \n A garment with a buckled belt fast girded did she weare \n And in a white and slender Call slight trussed was hir heare. \n Sometimes a dart sometime a bow she used for to beare. \n She was a knight of Phebes troope. There came not at the mount \n Of Menalus of whome Diana made so great account. \n But favor never lasteth long. The Sunne had gone that day \n A good way past the poynt of Noone: when werie of hir way \n She drue to shadowe in a wood that never had bene cut. \n Here off hir shoulder by and by hir quiver did she put, \n And hung hir bow unbent aside, and coucht hir on the ground, \n Hir quiver underneth hir head. Whom when that Jove had found \n Alone and wearie: Sure (he said) my wife shall never know \n Of this escape, and if she do, I know the worst I trow. \n She can but chide, shall feare of chiding make me to forslow? \n He counterfeiteth Phebe streight in countnance and aray. \n And says: O virgine of my troope, where didst thou hunt to day? \n The Damsell started from the ground and said: Hayle Goddesse deare, \n Of greater worth than Jove (I thinke) though Jove himselfe did heare. \n Jove heard hir well and smylde thereat, it made his heart rejoyce \n To heare the Nymph preferre him thus before himselfe in choyce. \n He fell to kissing: which was such as out of square might seeme, \n And in such sort as that a mayde coulde nothing lesse beseeme. \n And as she would have told what woods she ranged had for game, \n He tooke hir fast betweene his armes, and not without his shame, \n Bewrayed plainly what he was and wherefore that he came. \n The wench against him strove as much as any woman could: \n I would that Juno had it seene. For then I know thou would \n Not take the deede so heynously: with all hir might she strove. \n But what poore wench or who alive could vanquish mighty Jove? \n Jove having sped flue straight to heaven. She hateth in hir hart \n The guiltlesse fields and wood where Jove had playd that naughty part, \n Alwaye she goes in such a griefe as that she had welnie \n Forgot hir quiver with hir shaftes and bow that hanged by. \n Dictynna, garded with hir traine and proude of killing Deere, \n In raunging over Menalus, espying, cald hir neere. \n The Damsell hearing Phebe call did run away amaine, \n She feared lest in Phebes shape that Jove had come againe, \n But when she saw the troope of Nymphes that garded hir about, \n She thought there was no more deceyt, and came among the rout. \n Oh Lord how hard a matter ist for guiltie hearts to shift \n And kepe their countnance? from the ground hir eyes scarce durst she lift. \n She prankes not by hir mistresse side, she preases not to bee \n The foremost of the companie, as when she erst was free. \n She standeth muet: and by chaunging of hir colour ay \n The treading of hir shooe awrie she plainely doth bewray, \n Diana might have founde the fault but that she was a May. \n A thousand tokens did appeare apparant to the eye, \n By which the Nymphes themselves (they say) hir fault did well espie. \n Nine times the Moone full to the worlde had shewde hir horned face \n When fainting through hir brothers flames and hunting in the chace. \n She found a coole and shadie lawnde through midst whereof she spide \n A shallow brooke with trickling streame on gravell bottom glide. \n And liking well the pleasant place, upon the upper brim \n She dipt hir foote, and finding there the water coole and trim, \n Away (she sayd) with standers by: and let us bath us here. \n Then Parrhasis cast downe hir head with sad and bashfull chere. \n The rest did strip them to their skinnes. She only sought delay, \n Untill that would or would she not hir clothes were pluckt away. \n Then with hir naked body straight hir crime was brought to light. \n Which yll ashamde as with hir hands she would have hid from sight, \n Fie beast (quoth Cynthia) get thee hence, thou shalt not here defile \n This sacred Spring, and from hir traine she did hir quite exile.\n\n \n",
            "5":"\n\n The Matrone of the thundring Jove had inckling of the fact, \n Delaying till convenient time the punishment to exact. \n There is no cause of further stay.

Oh how oft she daring not abide \n Alone among the desert woods, full many a time and tide \n Would stalke before hir house in grounds that were hir owne erewhile? \n How oft oh did she in the hilles the barking houndes beguile \n And in the lawndes where she hir selfe had chased erst hir game, \n Now flie hirselfe to save hir life when hunters sought the same? \n Full oft at sight of other beastes she hid hir head for feare, \n Forgetting what she was hir selfe. For though she were a Beare, \n Yet when she spied other Beares she quooke for verie paine: \n And feared Wolves although hir Sire among them did remaine. \n Beholde Lycaons daughters sonne that Archas had to name \n About the age of fiftene yeares within the forrest came \n Of Erymanth, not knowing ought of this his mothers case. \n There after pitching of his toyles, as he the stagges did chase, \n Upon his mother sodenly it was his chaunce to light, \n Who for desire to see hir sonne did stay hirselfe from flight. \n And wistly on him cast hir looke as one that did him know. \n But he not knowing what she was began his heeles to show. \n And when he saw hir still persist in staring on his face, \n He was afrayde, and from hir sight withdrew himselfe apace, \n But when he coulde not so be rid, he tooke an armed pike, \n In full intent hir through the heart with deadly wound to strike. \n But God almighty held his hand, and lifting both away \n Did disapoint the wicked Act. For straight he did convay \n Them through the Ayre with whirling windes to top of all the skie, \n And there did make them neighbour starres about the Pole on hie. \n When Juno shining in the heaven hir husbands minion found, \n She swelde for spight: and downe she comes to watry Tethys round \n And unto olde Oceanus, whome even the Gods aloft \n Did reverence for their just deserts full many a time and oft, \n To whome demaunding hir the cause: And aske ye (quoth she) why \n That I which am the Queene of Goddes come hither from the sky? \n Good cause there is I warrant you. Another holdes my roome. \n For never trust me while I live, if when the night is coome, \n And overcasteth all the world with shadie darknesse whole, \n Ye see not in the heigth of heaven hard by the Northren Pole \n Whereas the utmost circle runnes about the Axeltree \n In shortest circuit, gloriously enstalled for to bee \n In shape of starres the stinging woundes that make me yll apayde. \n Now is there (trow ye) any cause why folke should be afrayde \n To do to Juno what they list, or dread hir wrathfull mood, \n Which only by my working harme doe turne my foes to good? \n O what a mightie act is done? How passing is my powre! \n I have bereft hir womans shape, and at this present howre \n She is become a Goddesse. Loe this is the scourge so sowre \n Wherewith I strike mine enimies. Loe here is all the spight \n That I can doe: this is the ende of all my wondrous might, \n No force. I would he should (for me) hir native shape restore, \n And take away hir brutish shape, like as he hath before \n Done by his other Paramour, that fine and proper piece \n Of Argos whom he made a Cow, I meane Phononeus Niece. \n Why makes he not a full devorce from me, and in my stead \n Straight take his Sweetheart to his wife, and coll hir in my bed? \n He can not doe a better deede (I thinke) than for to take \n Lycaon to his fatherinlaw. But if that you doe make \n Accompt of me your foster childe, then graunt that for my sake, \n The Oxen and the wicked Waine of starres in number seven, \n For whoredome sake but late ago receyved into heaven, \n May never dive within your waves. Ne let that strumpet vyle \n By bathing of hir filthie limmes your waters pure defile.\n\n \n",
            "6":"\n\n The Gods did graunt hir hir request: and straight to heaven she flue, \n In handsome Chariot through the Ayre, which painted peacocks drue \n As well beset with blasing eyes late tane from Argus hed, \n As thou thou prating Raven white by nature being bred, \n Hadst on thy fethers justly late a coly colour spred. \n For this same birde in auncient time had fethers faire and whight \n As ever was the driven snow, or silver cleare and bright. \n He might have well comparde himself in beautie with the Doves \n That have no blemish, or the Swan that running water loves: \n Or with the Geese that afterward should with their gagling out \n Preserve the Romaine Capitoll beset with foes about. \n His tongue was cause of all his harme, his tatling tongue did make \n His colour which before was white, become so foule and blake. \n Coronis of Larissa was the fairest maide of face, \n In all the land of Thessalie . Shee stoode in Phebus grace \n As long as that she kept hir chast, or at the least as long \n As that she scaped unespide in doing Phebus wrong. \n But at the last Apollos birde hir privie packing spide, \n Whome no entreatance could persuade but that he swiftly hide \n Him to his maister, to bewray the doings of his love. \n Now as he flue, the pratling Crow hir wings apace did move: \n And overtaking fell in talke and was inquisitive \n For what intent and to what place he did so swiftly drive. \n And when she heard the cause thereof, she said: Now trust me sure, \n This message on the whiche thou goste no goodnesse will procure. \n And therefore hearken what I say: disdaine thou not at all, \n To take some warning by thy friende in things that may befall. \n Consider what I erst have bene and what thou seest me now: \n And what hath bene the ground hereof. I boldly dare avow, \n That thou shalt finde my faithfulnesse imputed for a crime. \n For Pallas in a wicker chest had hid upon a time \n A childe calde Ericthonius, whome never woman bare, \n And tooke it unto Maidens three that Cecrops daughters were, \n Not telling them what was within, but gave them charge to keepe \n The Casket shut, and for no cause within the same to peepe. \n I standing close among the leaves upon an Elme on hie, \n Did marke their doings and their wordes, and there I did espie \n How Pandrosos and Herse kept their promise faithfully. \n Aglauros calles them Cowardes both, and makes no more adoe, \n But takes the Casket in hir hand and doth the knots undooe. \n And there they saw a childe whose partes beneath were like a snake. \n Straight to the Goddesse of this deede a just report I make. \n For which she gave me this reward that never might I more \n Accompt hir for my Lady and my Mistresse as before. \n And in my roume she put the fowle that flies not but by night, \n A warning unto other birdes my lucke should be of right \n To holde their tongues for being shent. But you will say perchaunce \n I came unsentfor of my selfe, she did me not advaunce. \n I dare well say though Pallas now my heavie Mistresse stand \n Yet if perhaps ye should demaund the question at hir hand, \n As sore displeased as she is, she would not this denie: \n But that she chose me first hir selfe to beare hir companie. \n For (well I know) my father was a Prince of noble fame, \n Of Phocis King by long discent, Coronew was his name: \n I was his darling and his joy, and many a welthie Piere \n (I would not have you thinke disdaine) did seeke me for their Fere. \n My forme and beautie did me hurt. For as I leysurely \n Went jetting up and downe the shore upon the gravell drie, \n As yet I customably doe, the God that rules the Seas \n Espying me fell straight in love. And when he saw none ease \n In sute, but losse of wordes and time, he offred violence, \n And after me he runnes apace. I skudde as fast fro thence, \n From sand to shore from shore to sand, still playing Foxe to hole, \n Untill I was so tirde that he had almost got the gole. \n Then cald I out on God and man. But (as it did appeare) \n There was no man so neare at hand that could my crying heare. \n A Virgin Goddesse pitied me bicause I was a mayde: \n And at the utter plunge and pinche did send me present ayde. \n I cast mine armes to heaven, mine armes waxt light with fethers black, \n I went about to cast in hast my garments from my back, \n And all was fethers. In my skinne the rooted fethers stack. \n I was about with violent hand to strike my naked breast, \n But nether had I hand nor breast that naked more did reast. \n I ran, but of my feete as erst remained not the print. \n Me thought I glided on the ground. Anon with sodaine dint, \n I rose and hovered in the Ayre. And from that instant time \n Did wait on Pallas faithfully without offence or crime. \n But what availes all this to me, and if that in my place \n The wicked wretch Nyctyminee (who late for lacke of grace \n Was turned to an odious birde) to honor called bee? \n I pray thee didst thou never heare how false Nyctyminee \n (A thing all over Lesbos knowne) defilde hir fathers couch? \n The beast is now become a birde, whose lewdnesse doth so touch \n And pricke hir guiltie conscience that she dares not come in sight, \n Nor shewe hirselfe abrode a dayes, but fleeteth in the night \n For shame lest folke should see hir fault: and every other birde \n Doth in the Ayre and Ivie toddes with wondring at hir girde. \n A mischiefe take thy tatling tongue, the Raven answerde tho. \n Thy vaine forspeaking moves me not. And so he forth did go \n And tels his Lorde Apollo how he saw Coronis lie \n Wyth Isthyis, a Gentleman that dwelt in Thessalie . \n When Phebus heard his lovers fault, he fiersly gan to frowne, \n And cast his garlond from his head, and threw his violl downe. \n His colour chaungde, his face lookt pale, and as the rage of yre \n That boyled in his belking breast had set his heart on fyre, \n He caught me up his wonted tooles, and bent his golden bow \n And by and by with deadly stripe of unavoyded blow \n Strake through the breast the which his owne had toucht so oft afore. \n She wounded gave a piteous shrike, and (drawing from the sore \n The deadly Dart the which the bloud pursuing after fast \n Upon hir white and tender limmes a scarlet colour cast) \n Saide: Phebus , well, thou might have wreakt this trespasse on my head \n And yet forborne me till the time I had bene brought abed. \n Now in one body by thy meanes a couple shall be dead. \n Thus muche she saide: and with the bloud hir life did fade away. \n The bodie being voyde of soule became as colde as clay. \n Than all too late, alas too late gan Phebus to repent \n That of his lover he had tane so cruell punishment. \n He blames himselfe for giving eare so unadvisedly. \n He blames himselfe in that he tooke it so outragiously. \n He hates and bannes his faithfull birde bicause he did enforme \n Him of his lovers naughtinesse that made him so to storme. \n He hates his bow, he hates his shaft that rashly from it went: \n And eke he hates his hasty hands by whom the bow was bent. \n He takes hir up betweene his armes endevoring all too late \n By plaister made of precious herbes to stay hir helplesse fate. \n But when he saw there was no shift: but that she needes must burne, \n And that the solemne sacred fire was prest to serve the turne, \n Then from the bottome of his heart full sorie sighes he fet, \n (For heavenly powres with watrie teares their cheekes may never wet) \n In case as when a Cow beholdes the cruell butcher stand \n With launching Axe embrewd with bloud and lifting up his hand \n Aloft to snatch hir sucking Calfe that hangeth by the heeles \n And of the Axe the deadly dint upon his forehead feeles. \n Howbeit after sweete perfumes bestowde upon hir corse \n And much embracing, having sore bewailde hir wrong divorse, \n He followed to the place assignde hir bodie for to burne. \n There coulde he not abide to see his seede to ashes turne. \n But tooke the baby from hir wombe and from the firie flame, \n And unto double Chyrons den conveyed straight the same. \n The Raven hoping for his truth to be rewarded well, \n He maketh blacke, forbidding him with whiter birdes to dwell. \n\n \n",
            "7":"\n\n The Centaure Chyron in the while was glad of Phebus boy, \n And as the burthen brought some care the honor brought him joy. \n Upon a time with golden lockes about hir shoulders spread, \n A daughter of the Centaurs (whome a certaine Nymph had bred \n About the brooke Caycus bankes) that hight Ocyroe \n Came thither. This same fayre yong Nymph could not contented be \n To learne the craft of Surgerie as perfect as hir Sire, \n But that to learne the secret doomes of Fate she must aspire. \n And therfore when the furious rage of frenzie had hir cought, \n And that the spright of Prophecie enflamed had hir thought, \n She lookt upon the childe and saide: Sweete babe the Gods thee make \n A man. For all the world shall fare the better for thy sake. \n All sores and sicknesse shalt thou cure: thy powre shall eke be syche, \n To make the dead alive again. For doing of the whiche \n Against the pleasure of the Gods, thy Graundsire shall thee strike \n So with his fire, that never more thou shalt performe the like. \n And of a God a bludlesse corse, and of a corse (full straunge) \n Thou shalt become a God againe, and twice thy nature chaunge. \n And thou my father liefe and deare, who now by destinie, \n Art borne to live for evermore and never for to die, \n Shalt suffer such outragious paine throughout thy members all, \n By wounding of a venimde dart that on thy foote shall fall, \n That oft thou shalt desire to die, and in the latter end \n The fatall dames shall breake thy threede and thy desire thee send. \n There was yet more behinde to tell, when sodenly she fet \n A sore deepe sigh, and downe hir cheekes the teares did trickle wet. \n Mine owne misfortune (quoth she) now hath overtake me sure. \n I cannot utter any more, for words waxe out of ure. \n My cunning was not worth so much as that it should procure \n The wrath of God. I feele by proufe far better had it bene: \n If that the chaunce of things to come I never had foreseene. \n For now my native shape withdrawes. Me thinkes I have delight \n To feede on grasse and fling in fieldes: I feele my selfe so light. \n I am transformed to a Mare like other of my kinne. \n But wherfore should this brutish shape all over wholy winne? \n Considering that although both horse and man my father bee: \n Yet is his better part a man as plainly is to see. \n The latter ende of this complaint was fumbled in such wise, \n As what she meant the standers by could scarcely well devise. \n Anon she neyther semde to speake nor fully for to ney, \n But like to one that counterfeites in sport the Mare to play. \n Within a while she neyed plaine, and downe hir armes were pight \n Upon the ground all clad with haire, and bare hir bodie right. \n Hir fingers joyned all in one, at ende wherof did grow \n In stede of nayles a round tough hoofe of welked horne bylow. \n Hir head and necke shot forth in length, hir kirtle trayne became \n A faire long taile. Hir flaring haire was made a hanging Mane. \n And as hir native shape and voyce most monstrously did passe, \n So by the uncoth name of Mare she after termed was.\n\n \n",
            "8":"\n\n The Centaure Chyron wept hereat: and piteously dismaide \n Did call on thee (although in vaine) thou Delphian God for ayde. \n For neyther lay it in thy hande to breake Joves mighty hest, \n And though it had, yet in thy state as then thou did not rest. \n In Elis did thou then abide and in Messene lande. \n It was the time when under shape of shepehierde with a wande \n Of Olyve and a pipe of reedes thou kept Admetus sheepe. \n Now in this time that (save of Love) thou tooke none other keepe, \n And madste thee merrie with thy pipe, the glistring Maias sonne \n By chaunce abrode the fields of Pyle spide certaine cattle runne \n Without a hierde, the which he stole and closely did them hide \n Among the woods. This pretie slight no earthly creature spide, \n Save one old churle that Battus hight. This Battus had the charge \n Of welthie Neleus feeding groundes, and all his pastures large, \n And kept a race of goodly Mares. Of him he was afraide. \n And lest by him his privie theft should chaunce to be bewraide, \n He tooke a bribe to stop his mouth, and thus unto him saide: \n My friend I pray thee if perchaunce that any man enquire \n This cattell say thou saw them not. And take thou for thy hire \n This faire yong Bullocke. Tother tooke the Bullocke at his hand, \n And shewing him a certaine stone that lay upon the lande, \n Sayd, go thy way: Assoone this stone thy doings shall bewray, \n As I shall doe. So Mercurie did seeme to go his way. \n Annon he commes me backe againe, and altred both in speche \n And outward shape, saide: Countrieman Ich heartely bezeche, \n And if thou zawest any kie come royling through this grounde, \n Or driven away, tell what he was and where they may be vownde. \n And I chill gethee vor thy paine an Hecfar and hir match. \n The Carle perceyving double gaine, and greedy for to catch, \n Sayde: Under yon same hill they were, and under yon same hill \n Cham zure they are, and with his hand he poynted thereuntill. \n At that Mercurius laughing saide: False knave: and doste bewray \n Me to my selfe? doste thou bewray me to my selfe I say? \n And with that word strayt to a stone he turnde his double heart, \n In which the slaunder yet remaines without the stones desart.\n\n \n",
            "9":"\n\n The Bearer of the charmed Rod, the suttle Mercurie, \n This done, arose with waving wings and from that place did flie. \n And as he hovered in the Ayre he viewde the fieldes bylow \n Of Atticke and the towne it selfe with all the trees that grow \n In Lycey where the learned Clarkes did wholsome preceptes show. \n By chaunce the verie selfesame day the virgins of the towne \n Of olde and auncient custome bare in baskets on their crowne \n Beset with garlands fresh and gay and strowde with flowres sweete \n To Pallas towre such sacrifice as was of custome meete. \n The winged God beholding them returning in a troupe \n Continued not directly forth, but gan me downe to stoupe, \n And fetch a wyndlasse round about. And as the hungry kite \n Beholding unto sacrifice a Bullocke redie dight, \n Doth sore about his wished pray desirous for to snatche \n But that he dareth not for such as stand about and watch: \n So Mercurie with nimble wings doth keepe a lower gate \n About Minervas loftie towres in round and wheeling rate. \n As far as doth the Morning starre in cleare and streaming light \n Excell all other starres in heaven: as far also as bright \n Dame Phebe dimmes the Morning starre, so far did Herses face \n Staine all the Ladies of hir troupe: she was the verie grace \n And beautie of that solemne pompe, and all that traine so fayre. \n Joves sonne was ravisht with the sight, and hanging in the ayre \n Began to swelt within himselfe, in case as when the poulder \n Hath driven the Pellet from the Gunne, the Pellet ginnes to smoulder: \n And in his flying waxe more hote. In smoking brest he shrowdes \n His flames not brought from heaven above but caught beneath the clouds. \n He leaves his jorney toward heaven and takes another race \n Not minding any lenger time to hide his present case. \n So great a trust and confidence his beautie to him gave \n Which though it seemed of it selfe sufficient force to have, \n Yet was he curious for to make himselfe more fine and brave. \n He kembd his head and strokt his beard, and pried on every side \n To see that in his furniture no wrinkle might be spide. \n And forbicause his Cloke was fringde and garded brode with golde, \n He cast it on his shoulder up most seemely to beholde. \n He takes in hand his charmed rod that bringeth things asleepe \n And wakes them when he list againe. And lastly taketh keepe \n That on his faire welformed feete his golden shooes sit cleene, \n And that all other things therto well correspondent beene. \n In Cecrops Court were Chambers three set far from all resort \n With yvorie beddes all furnished in far most royall sort. \n Of which Aglauros had the left and Pandrose had the right, \n And Herse had the middlemost. She that Aglauros hight \n First markt the comming of the God, and asking him his name \n Demaunded him for what entent and cause he thither came. \n Pleiones Nephew, Maias sonne, did make hir aunswere thus: \n I am my fathers messenger, his pleasure to discusse \n To mortall folke and hellish fiendes as list him to commaund. \n My father is the mightie Jove. To that thou doste demaund \n I will not feyne a false excuse. I aske no more but graunt \n To keepe thy sisters counsell close, and for to be the Aunt \n Of such the issue as on hir my chaunce shalbe to get. \n Thy sister Herse is the cause that hath me hither fet. \n I pray thee beare thou with my love that is so firmely set. \n Aglauros cast on Mercurie hir scornfull eyes aside, \n With which against Minervas will hir secretes late she spide, \n Demaunding him in recompence a mighty masse of Golde: \n And would not let him enter in until the same were tolde. \n The warlike Goddesse cast on hir a sterne and cruell looke, \n And fetched such a cutting sigh that forcibly it shooke \n Both brest and brestplate, wherewithall it came unto hir thought \n How that Aglauros late ago against hir will had wrought \n In looking on the Lemman childe contrarie to hir othe, \n The whiche she tooke hir in the chest, for which she waxed wrothe. \n Againe she saw hir cancred heart maliciously repine \n Against hir sister and the God. And furthermore in fine \n How that the golde which Mercurie had given hir for hir meede, \n Would make hir both in welth and pride all others to exceede. \n She goes me straight to Envies house, a foule and irksome cave, \n Replete with blacke and lothly filth and stinking like a grave. \n It standeth in a hollow dale where neyther light of Sunne \n Nor blast of any winde or Ayre may for the deepenesse come. \n A dreyrie sad and dolefull den ay full of slouthfull colde \n As which ay dimd with smoldring smoke doth never fire beholde, \n When Pallas , that same manly Maide, approched nere this plot, \n She staide without, for to the house in enter might she not, \n And with hir Javelin point did give a push against the doore. \n The doore flue open by and by and fell me in the floore. \n There saw she Envie sit within fast gnawing on the flesh \n Of Snakes and Todes, the filthie foode that keepes hir vices fresh. \n It lothde hir to beholde the sight. Anon the Elfe arose \n And left the gnawed Adders flesh, and slouthfully she goes \n With lumpish laysure like a Snayle, and when she saw the face \n Of Pallas and hir faire attire adournde with heavenly grace, \n She gave a sigh, a sorie sigh, from bottome of hir heart. \n Hir lippes were pale, hir cheekes were wan, and all hir face was swart: \n Hir bodie leane as any Rake. She looked eke askew. \n Hir teeth were furde with filth and drosse, hir gums were waryish blew. \n The working of hir festered gall had made hir stomacke greene. \n And all bevenimde was hir tongue. No sleepe hir eyes had seene. \n Continuall Carke and cankred care did keepe hir waking still: \n Of laughter (save at others harmes) the Helhound can no skill. \n It is against hir will that men have any good successe, \n And if they have, she frettes and fumes within hir minde no lesse \n Than if hir selfe had taken harme. In seeking to annoy \n And worke distresse to other folke, hir selfe she doth destroy. \n Thus is she torment to hir selfe. Though Pallas did hir hate, \n Yet spake she briefly these few wordes to hir without hir gate: \n Infect thou with thy venim one of Cecrops daughters three, \n It is Aglauros whome I meane, for so it needes must bee. \n This said, she pight hir speare in ground, and tooke hir rise thereon. \n And winding from that wicked wight did take hir flight anon. \n The Caitife cast hir eye aside, and seeing Pallas gon, \n Began to mumble with hir selfe the Divels Paternoster, \n And fretting at hir good successe, began to blow and bluster. \n She takes a crooked staffe in hand bewreathde with knubbed prickes, \n And covered with a coly cloude, where ever that she stickes \n Hir filthie feete, she tramples downe and seares both grasse and corne: \n That all the fresh and fragrant fieldes seeme utterly forlorne. \n And with hir staffe she tippeth off the highest poppie heades. \n Such poyson also every where ungraciously she sheades, \n That every Cottage where she comes and every Towne and Citie \n Doe take infection at hir breath. At length (the more is pitie) \n She found the faire Athenian towne that flowed freshly then \n In feastfull peace and joyfull welth and learned witts of men. \n And forbicause she nothing saw that might provoke to weepe, \n It was a corsie to hir heart hir hatefull teares to keepe. \n Now when she came within the Court, she went without delay \n Directly to the lodgings where King Cecrops daughters lay, \n There did she as Minerva bad. She laide hir scurvie fist \n Besmerde with venim and with filth upon Aglauros brist, \n The whiche she filde with hooked thornes: and breathing on hir face \n Did shead the poyson in hir bones: which spred it selfe apace, \n As blacke as ever virgin pitch through Lungs and Lights and all. \n And to th'intent that cause of griefe abundantly should fall, \n She placed ay before hir eyes hir sisters happie chaunce \n In being wedded to the God, and made the God to glaunce \n Continually in heavenly shape before hir wounded thought. \n And all these things she painted out, which in conclusion wrought \n Such corsies in Aglauros brest that sighing day and night \n She gnawde and fretted in hir selfe for very cancred spight. \n And like a wretche she wastes hir selfe with restlesse care and pine \n Like as the yse whereon the Sunne with glimering light doth shine. \n Hir sister Herses good successe doth make hir heart to yerne, \n In case as when that fire is put to greenefeld wood or fearne \n Whych giveth neyther light nor heate, but smulders quite away: \n Sometime she minded to hir Sire hir sister to bewray, \n Who (well she knew) would yll abide so lewde a part to play. \n And oft she thought with wilfull hande to brust hir fatall threede, \n Bicause she woulde not see the thing that made hir heart to bleede. \n At last she sate hir in the doore and leaned to a post \n To let the God from entring in. To whome now having lost \n Much talke and gentle wordes in vayne, she said: Sir, leave I pray \n For hence I will not (be you sure) onlesse you go away. \n I take thee at thy word (quoth he) and therewithall he pusht \n His rod against the barred doore, and wide it open rusht. \n She making proffer for to rise, did feele so great a waight \n Through all hir limmes, that for hir life she could not stretch hir straight. \n She strove to set hirself upright: but striving booted not. \n Hir hamstrings and hir knees were stiffe, a chilling colde had got \n In at hir nayles, through all hir limmes. And eke hir veynes began \n For want of bloud and lively heate, to waxe both pale and wan. \n And as the freting Fistula forgrowne and past all cure \n Runnes in the flesh from place to place, and makes the sound and pure \n As bad or worser than the rest, even so the cold of death \n Strake to hir heart, and closde hir veines, and lastly stopt hir breath: \n She made no profer for to speake, and though she had done so \n It had bene vaine.

When in that while hir Sire \n Not knowing where she was become, sent after to enquire \n Hir brother Cadmus , charging him his sister home to bring, \n Or never for to come againe: wherein he did a thing, \n For which he might both justly kinde and cruell called bee. \n When Cadmus over all the world had sought, (for who is hee \n That can detect the thefts of Jove?) and no where could hir see, \n Then as an outlaw (to avoyde his fathers wrongfull yre) \n He went to Phebus Oracle most humbly to desire \n His heavenly counsell, where he would assigne him place to dwell. \n An Heifer all alone in field (quoth Phebus) marke hir well, \n Which never bare the pinching yoke, nor drew the plough as yit, \n Shall meete thee. Follow after hir, and where thou seest hir sit, \n There builde a towne, and let thereof Beotia be the name. \n Downe from Parnasus stately top scarce fully Cadmus came, \n When royling softly in the vale before the herde alone \n He saw an Heifer on whose necke of servage print was none. \n He followde after leysurly as hir that was his guide, \n And thanked Phebus in his heart that did so well provide. \n Now had he past Cephisus forde, and eke the pleasant groundes \n About the Citie Panope conteinde within those boundes. \n The Heifer staide, and lifting up hir forehead to the skie \n Full seemely for to looke upon with homes like braunches hie \n Did with hir lowing fill the Ayre: and casting backe hir eie \n Upon the rest that came aloofe, as softly as she could \n Kneelde downe and laide hir hairie side against the grassie mould. \n Then Cadmus gave Apollo thankes, and falling flat bylow \n Did kisse the ground and haile the fields which yet he did not know. \n He was about to sacrifice to Jove the Heavenly King, \n And bad his servants goe and fetch him water of the spring. \n An olde forgrowne unfelled wood stoode neare at hand thereby, \n And in the middes a queachie plot with Sedge and Osiers hie, \n Where courbde about with peble stone in likenesse of a bow \n There was a spring with silver streames that forth thereof did flow. \n Here lurked in his lowring den God Mars his griesly Snake \n With golden scales and firie eyes beswolne with poyson blake. \n Three spirting tongues, three rowes of teeth within his head did sticke. \n No sooner had the Tirian folke set foote within this thicke \n And queachie plot, and deped downe their bucket in the well, \n But that to buscle in his den began this Serpent fell, \n And peering with a marble head right horribly to hisse. \n The Tirians let their pitchers slip for sodaine feare of this, \n And waxing pale as any clay, like folke amazde and flaight, \n Stoode trembling like an Aspen leafe. The specled serpent straight \n Commes trailing out in waving linkes, and knottie rolles of scales, \n And bending into bunchie boughts his bodie forth he hales. \n And lifting up above the wast himselfe unto the Skie, \n He overlooketh all the wood, as huge and big welnie \n As is the Snake that in the Heaven about the Nordren Pole \n Devides the Beares. He makes no stay but deales his dreadfull dole \n Among the Tirians. Whether they did take them to their tooles, \n Or to their heeles, or that their feare did make them stand like fooles, \n And helpe themselves by none of both, he snapt up some alive, \n And swept in others with his taile, and some he did deprive \n Of life with rankenesse of his breath, and other some againe \n He stings and poysons unto death till all at last were slaine. \n Now when the Sunne was at his heigth and shadowes waxed short, \n And Cadmus saw his companie make tarience in that sort, \n He marveld what should be their let, and went to seeke them out. \n His harnesse was a Lions skin that wrapped him about. \n His weapons were a long strong speare with head of yron tride, \n And eke a light and piercing Dart. And thereunto beside \n Worth all the weapons in the world a stout and valiant hart. \n When Cadmus came within the wood and saw about that part \n His men lie slaine upon the ground, and eke their cruell fo \n Of bodie huge stand over them, and licking with his blo \n And blasting tongue their sorie woundes: Well trustie friendes (quoth he) \n I eyther of your piteous deathes will streight revenger be, \n Or else will die my selfe therefore. With that he raughting fast \n A mightie Milstone, at the Snake with all his might it cast. \n The stone with such exceding force and violence forth was driven, \n As of a fort the bulwarkes strong and walles it would have riven. \n And yet it did the Snake no harme: his scales as hard and tough \n As if they had bene plates of mayle did fence him well inough, \n So that the stone rebounded backe against his freckled slough. \n But yet his hardnesse savde him not against the piercing dart. \n For hitting right betweene the scales that yeelded in that part \n Whereas the joynts doe knit the backe, it thirled through the skin, \n And pierced to his filthy mawe and greedy guts within. \n He fierce with wrath wrings backe his head, and looking on the stripe, \n The Javeling steale that sticked out, betwene his teeth doth gripe. \n The which with wresting to and fro at length he forth did winde, \n Save that he left the head therof among his bones behinde. \n When of his courage through the wound more kindled was the ire, \n His throteboll swelde with puffed veines, his eyes gan sparkle fire. \n There stoode about his smeared chaps a lothly foming froth. \n His skaled brest ploughes up the ground, the stinking breath that goth \n Out from his blacke and hellish mouth infectes the herbes full fowle. \n Sometime he windes himselfe in knots as round as any Bowle. \n Sometime he stretcheth out in length as straight as any beame. \n Anon againe with violent brunt he rusheth like a streame \n Encreast by rage of latefalne raine, and with his mightie sway \n Beares downe the wood before his breast that standeth in his way. \n Agenors sonne retiring backe doth with his Lions spoyle \n Defend him from his fierce assaults, and makes him to recoyle \n Aye holding at the weapons point. The Serpent waxing wood \n Doth crashe the steele betwene his teeth, and bites it till the blood, \n Dropt mixt with poyson from his mouth, did die the greene grasse blacke, \n But yet the wound was verie light bicause he writhed backe \n And puld his head still from the stroke: and made the stripe to die \n By giving way, untill that Cadmus following irefully \n The stroke, with all his powre and might did through the throte him rive, \n And naylde him to an Oke behind the which he eke did clive. \n The Serpents waight did make the tree to bend.

This Lady bare a sonne \n Whose beautie at his verie birth might justly love have wonne. \n -Narcissus did she call his name. Of whome the Prophet sage, \n -Demaunded if the childe should live to many yeares of age, \n Made aunswere: Yea full long, so that him selfe he doe not know. \n The Soothsayers wordes seemde long but vaine, untill the end did show \n His saying to be true in deede by straungenesse of the rage, \n And straungenesse of the kinde of death that did abridge his age. \n For when yeares three times five and one he fully lyved had, \n So that he seemde to stande beetwene the state of man and Lad, \n The hearts of dyvers trim yong men his beautie gan to move \n And many a Ladie fresh and faire was taken in his love. \n But in that grace of Natures gift such passing pride did raigne, \n That to be toucht of man or Mayde he wholy did disdaine. \n A babling Nymph that Echo hight, who hearing others talke, \n By no meanes can restraine hir tongue but that it needes must walke, \n Nor of hir selfe hath powre to ginne to speake to any wight, \n Espyde him dryving into toyles the fearefull stagges of flight. \n This Echo was a body then and not an onely voyce. \n Yet of hir speach she had that time no more than now the choyce, \n That is to say, of many wordes the latter to repeate. \n The cause thereof was Junos wrath. For when that with the feate \n She might have often taken Jove in daliance with his Dames, \n And that by stealth and unbewares in middes of all his games, \n This elfe would with hir tatling talke deteine hir by the way, \n Untill that Jove had wrought his will and they were fled away. \n The which when Juno did perceyve, she said with wrathfull mood: \n This tongue that hath deluded me shall doe thee little good, \n For of thy speach but simple use hereafter shalt thou have. \n The deede it selfe did straight confirme the threatnings that she gave. \n Yet Echo of the former talke doth double oft the ende \n And backe againe with just report the wordes earst spoken sende. \n Now when she sawe Narcissus stray about the Forrest wyde, \n She waxed warme and step for step fast after him she hyde. \n The more she followed after him and neerer that she came, \n The hoter ever did she waxe as neerer to hir flame. \n Lyke as the lively Brimstone doth which dipt about a match, \n And put but softly to the fire, the flame doth lightly catch. \n O Lord how often woulde she faine (if nature would have let) \n Entreated him with gentle wordes some favour for to get? \n But nature would not suffer hir nor give hir leave to ginne. \n Yet (so farre forth as she by graunt at natures hande could winne) \n As readie with attentive eare she harkens for some sounde, \n Whereto she might replie hir wordes, from which she is not bounde. \n By chaunce the stripling being strayde from all his companie, \n Sayde: Is there any body nie? Straight Echo answerde: I. \n Amazde he castes his eye aside, and looketh round about, \n And Come (that all the Forrest roong) aloud he calleth out. \n And Come (sayth she:) he looketh backe, and seeing no man followe, \n Why fliste, he cryeth once againe: and she the same doth hallowe. \n He still persistes and wondring much what kinde of thing it was \n From which that answering voyce by turne so duely seemde to passe, \n Said: Let us joyne. She (by hir will desirous to have said \n In fayth with none more willingly at any time or stead) \n Said: Let us joyne. And standing somewhat in hir owne conceit, \n Upon these wordes she left the Wood, and forth she yeedeth streit, \n To coll the lovely necke for which she longed had so much, \n He runnes his way and will not be imbraced of no such, \n And sayth: I first will die ere thou shalt take of me thy pleasure. \n She aunswerde nothing else thereto, but Take of me thy pleasure. \n Now when she saw hir selfe thus mockt, she gate hir to the Woods, \n And hid hir head for verie shame among the leaves and buddes. \n And ever sence she lyves alone in dennes and hollow Caves, \n Yet stacke hir love still to hir heart, through which she dayly raves \n The more for sorrowe of repulse. Through restlesse carke and care \n Hir bodie pynes to skinne and bone, and waxeth wonderous bare. \n The bloud doth vanish into ayre from out of all hir veynes, \n And nought is left but voyce and bones: the voyce yet still remaynes: \n Hir bones they say were turnde to stones. From thence she lurking still \n In Woods, will never shewe hir head in field nor yet on hill. \n Yet is she heard of every man: it is hir onely sound, \n And nothing else that doth remayne alive above the ground. \n Thus had he mockt this wretched Nymph and many mo beside, \n That in the waters, Woods and groves, or Mountaynes did abyde. \n Thus had he mocked many men. Of which one miscontent \n To see himselfe deluded so, his handes to Heaven up bent, \n And sayd: I pray to God he may once feele fierce Cupids fire \n As I doe now, and yet not joy the things he doth desire. \n The Goddesse Ramnuse (who doth wreake on wicked people take) \n Assented to his just request for ruth and pities sake. \n There was a spring withouten mudde as silver cleare and still, \n Which neyther sheepeheirds, nor the Goates that fed upon the hill, \n Nor other cattell troubled had, nor savage beast had styrd, \n Nor braunch nor sticke, nor leafe of tree, nor any soule nor byrd. \n The moysture fed and kept aye fresh the grasse that grew about, \n And with their leaves the trees did keepe the heate of Phoebus out. \n The stripling wearie with the heate and hunting in the chace, \n And much delighted with the spring and coolenesse of the place, \n Did lay him downe upon the brim: and as he stooped lowe \n To staunche his thurst, another thurst of worse effect did growe. \n For as he dranke, he chaunst to spie the Image of his face, \n The which he did immediately with fervent love embrace. \n He feedes a hope without cause why. For like a foolishe noddie \n He thinkes the shadow that he sees, to be a lively boddie. \n Astraughted like an ymage made of Marble stone he lyes, \n There gazing on his shadowe still with fixed staring eyes. \n Stretcht all along upon the ground, it doth him good to see \n His ardant eyes which like two starres full bright and shyning bee, \n And eke his fingars, fingars such as Bacchus might beseeme, \n And haire that one might worthely Apollos haire it deeme, \n His beardlesse chinne and yvorie necke, and eke the perfect grace \n Of white and red indifferently bepainted in his face. \n All these he woondreth to beholde, for which (as I doe gather) \n Himselfe was to be woondred at, or to be pitied rather. \n He is enamored of himselfe for want of taking heede, \n And where he lykes another thing, he lykes himselfe in deede. \n He is the partie whome he wooes, and suter that doth wooe, \n He is the flame that settes on fire, and thing that burneth tooe. \n O Lord how often did he kisse that false deceitfull thing? \n How often did he thrust his armes midway into the spring \n To have embraste the necke he saw and could not catch himselfe? \n He knowes not what it was he sawe. And yet the foolish elfe \n Doth burne in ardent love thereof. The verie selfsame thing \n That doth bewitch and blinde his eyes, encreaseth all his sting. \n Thou fondling thou, why doest thou raught the fickle image so? \n The thing thou seekest is not there. And if aside thou go, \n The thing thou lovest straight is gone. It is none other matter \n That thou doest see, than of thy selfe the shadow in the water. \n The thing is nothing of it selfe: with thee it doth abide, \n With thee it would departe if thou withdrew thy selfe aside.\n\n \n",

Yet for a little space \n He turnes and settes himselfe upright, and holding up his hands \n With piteous voyce unto the wood that round about him stands, \n Cryes out and ses: Alas ye Woods, and was there ever any \n That loovde so cruelly as I? you know: for unto many \n A place of harbrough have you beene, and fort of refuge strong. \n Can you remember any one in all your tyme so long \n That hath so pinde away as I?

I have not long to live, \n But in the floure of youth must die. To die it doth not grieve. \n For that by death shall come the ende of all my griefe and paine \n I would this yongling whome I love might lenger life obtaine: \n For in one soule shall now decay we stedfast Lovers twaine. \n This saide in rage he turnes againe unto the forsaide shade, \n And rores the water with the teares and sloubring that he made, \n That through his troubling of the Well his ymage gan to fade. \n Which when he sawe to vanish so: Oh whither dost thou flie? \n Abide I pray thee heartely, aloud he gan to crie. \n Forsake me not so cruelly that loveth thee so deere, \n But give me leave a little while my dazled eyes to cheere \n With sight of that which for to touch is utterly denide, \n Thereby to feede my wretched rage and furie for a tide. \n As in this wise he made his mone, he stripped off his cote \n And with his fist outragiously his naked stomacke smote. \n A ruddie colour where he smote rose on his stomacke sheere, \n Lyke Apples which doe partly white and striped red appeere, \n Or as the clusters ere the grapes to ripenesse fully come: \n An Orient purple here and there beginnes to grow on some. \n Which things as soon as in the spring he did beholde againe, \n He could no longer beare it out. But fainting straight for paine, \n As lith and supple waxe doth melt against the burning flame, \n Or morning dewe against the Sunne that glareth on the same: \n Even so by piecemale being spent and wasted through desire, \n Did he consume and melt away with Cupids secret fire. \n His lively hue of white and red, his cheerefulnesse and strength \n And all the things that lyked him did wanze away at length. \n So that in fine remayned not the bodie which of late \n The wretched Echo loved so. Who when she sawe his state, \n Although in heart she angrie were, and mindefull of his pride, \n Yet ruing his unhappie case, as often as he cride \n Alas, she cride, Alas likewise with shirle redoubled sound. \n And when he beate his breast, or strake his feete against the ground, \n She made like noyse of clapping too. These are the woordes that last \n Out of his lippes beholding still his woonted ymage past: \n Alas sweete boy belovde in vaine, farewell. And by and by \n With sighing sound the selfesame wordes the Echo did reply. \n With that he layde his wearie head against the grassie place \n And death did doze his gazing eyes that woondred at the grace \n And beautie which did late adorne their Masters heavenly face. \n And afterward when into Hell receyved was his spright \n He goes me to the Well of Styx , and there both day and night \n Standes tooting on his shadow still as fondely as before. \n The water Nymphes, his sisters, wept and wayled for him sore \n And on his bodie strowde their haire clipt off and shorne therefore. \n The Wood nymphes also did lament. And Echo did rebound \n To every sorrowfull noyse of theirs with like lamenting sound. \n The fire was made to burne the corse, and waxen Tapers light. \n A Herce to lay the bodie on with solemne pompe was dight. \n But as for bodie none remaind: in stead thereof they found \n A yellow floure with milke white leaves new sprong upon the ground.\n\n \n",

His wordes prove true in deede, \n For as the Prophet did forespeake so fell it out with speede. \n Anon this newefound Bacchus commes: the woods and fieldes rebound \n With noyse of shouts and howling out, and such confused sound. \n The folke runne flocking out by heapes, men, Mayds and wives togither \n The noble men and rascall sorte ran gadding also thither, \n The Orgies of this unknowne God full fondely to performe, \n The which when Penthey did perceyve, he gan to rage and storme. \n And sayde unto them: O ye ympes of Mars his snake by kinde \n What ayleth you? what fiend of hell doth thus enrage your minde? \n Hath tinking sound of pottes and pannes, hath noyse of crooked home, \n Have fonde illusions such a force that them whome heretoforne \n No arming sworde, no bloudie trumpe, no men in battail ray \n Could cause to shrinke, no sheepish shriekes of simple women fray, \n And dronken woodnesse wrought by wine and roughts of filthie freakes \n And sound of toying timpanes dauntes, and quite their courage breakes? \n Shall I at you, yee auncient men which from the towne of Tyre \n To bring your housholde Gods by Sea, in safetie did aspyre, \n And setled*hem within this place the which ye nowe doe yeelde \n In bondage quite without all force and fighting in the fielde, \n Or woonder at you yonger sorte approching unto mee \n More neare in courage and in yeares? whome meete it were to see \n With speare and not with thirse in hande, with glittring helme on hed, \n And not with leaves. Now call to minde of whome ye all are bred, \n And take the stomackes of that Snake, which being one alone, \n Right stoutly in his owne defence confounded many one. \n He for his harbrough and his spring his lyfe did nobly spend. \n Doe you no more but take a heart your Countrie to defende. \n He put to death right valeant knightes.

And though he scarcely stayd \n From putting him to tormentes strait, O wretched man (he sayde) \n Who by thy worthie death shalt be a sample unto other, \n Declare to me the names of thee, thy father and thy mother, \n And in what Countrie thou wert borne, and what hath caused thee, \n Of these straunge rites and sacrifice, a follower for to bee.\n\n \n",

And wyth that word he takes \n My roume, and leaving Naxus quite to other countries makes. \n The God then dalying with these mates, as though he had at last \n Begon to smell their suttle craft, out of the foredecke cast \n His eye upon the Sea: and then as though he seemde to weepe, \n Sayd: Sirs, to bring me on this coast ye doe not promise keepe. \n I see that this is not the land the which I did request. \n For what occasion in this sort deserve I to be drest? \n What commendation can you win, or praise thereby receyve, \n If men a Lad, if many one ye compasse to deceyve? \n I wept and sobbed all this while, the wicked villaines laught, \n And rowed forth with might and maine, as though they had bene straught. \n Now even by him (for sure than he in all the worlde so wide \n There is no God more neare at hand at every time and tide) \n I sweare unto you that the things the which I shall declare, \n Like as they seeme incredible, even so most true they are. \n The ship stoode still amid the Sea as in a dustie docke. \n They wondring at this miracle, and making but a mocke, \n Persist in beating with their Ores, and on with all their sayles. \n To make their Galley to remove, no Art nor labor fayles. \n But Ivie troubled so their Ores that forth they could not row: \n And both with Beries and with leaves their sailes did overgrow. \n And he himselfe with clustred grapes about his temples round, \n Did shake a Javeling in his hand that round about was bound \n With leaves of Vines: and at his feete there seemed for to couch \n Of Tygers, Lynx, and Panthers shapes most ougly for to touch. \n I cannot tell you whether feare or woodnesse were the cause, \n But every person leapeth up and from his labor drawes. \n And there one Medon first of all began to waxen blacke, \n And having lost his former shape did take a courbed backe. \n What Monster shall we have of thee (quoth Licab) and with that \n This Licabs chappes did waxen wide, his nosetrils waxed flat, \n His skin waxt tough, and scales thereon began anon to grow. \n And Libis as he went about the Ores away to throw, \n Perceived how his hands did shrinke and were become so short, \n That now for finnes and not for hands he might them well report. \n Another as he would have claspt his arme about the corde: \n Had nere an arme, and so bemaimd in bodie, over boord \n He leapeth downe among the waves, and forked is his tayle \n As are the homes of Phebes face when halfe hir light doth fayle. \n They leape about and sprinkle up much water on the ship, \n One while they swim above, and downe againe anon they slip. \n They fetch their friskes as in a daunce, and wantonly they writhe \n Now here now there among the waves their bodies bane and lithe. \n And with their wide and hollow nose the water in they snuffe, \n And by their noses out againe as fast they doe it puffe. \n Of twentie persons (for our ship so many men did beare) \n I only did remaine nigh straught and trembling still for feare. \n The God could scarce recomfort me, and yet he said: Go too, \n Feare not but saile to Dia ward. His will I gladly doe. \n And so as soone as I came there with right devout intent, \n His Chaplaine I became. And thus his Orgies I frequent.\n\n \n",

            "1":"\n\n Within the towne (of whose huge walles so monstrous high and thicke \n The fame is given Semyramis for making them of bricke) \n Dwelt hard together two yong folke in houses joynde so nere \n That under all one roofe well nie both twaine conveyed were. \n The name of him was Pyramus, and Thisbe calde was she. \n So faire a man in all the East was none alive as he, \n Nor nere a woman, maide nor wife in beautie like to hir. \n This neighbrod bred acquaintance first, this neyghbrod first did stirre \n The secret sparkes, this neighbrod first an entrance in did showe, \n For love to come to that to which it afterward did growe. \n And if that right had taken place they had bene man and wife, \n But still their Parents went about to let which (for their life) \n They could not let. For both their heartes with equall flame did burne. \n No man was privie to their thoughts. And for to serve their turne \n In steade of talke they used signes. The closelier they supprest - \n The fire of love, the fiercer still it raged in their brest. \n The wall that parted house from house had riven therein a crany \n Which shronke at making of the wall. This fault not markt of any \n Of many hundred yeares before (what doth not love espie) \n These lovers first of all found out, and made a way whereby \n To talke togither secretly, and through the same did goe \n Their loving whisprings verie light and safely to and fro. \n Now as at one side Pyramus and Thisbe on the tother \n Stoode often drawing one of them the pleasant breath from other: \n O thou envious wall (they sayd) why letst thou lovers thus? \n What matter were it if that thou permitted both of us \n In armes eche other to embrace? Or if thou thinke that this \n Were overmuch, yet mightest thou at least make roume to kisse. \n And yet thou shalt not finde us churles: we thinke our selves in det \n For this same piece of courtesie, in vouching safe to let \n Our sayings to our friendly eares thus freely come and goe. \n Thus having where they stoode in vaine complayned of their woe, \n When night drew nere, they bade adew and eche gave kisses sweete \n Unto the parget on their side, the which did never meete. \n Next morning with hir cherefull light had driven the starres aside \n And Phebus with his burning beames the dewie grasse had dride. \n These lovers at their wonted place by foreappointment met. \n Where after much complaint and mone they covenanted to get \n Away from such as watched them and in the Evening late \n To steale out of their fathers house and eke the Citie gate. \n And to th'intent that in the fieldes they strayde not up and downe \n They did agree at Ninus Tumb to meete without the towne, \n And tarie underneath a tree that by the same did grow \n Which was a faire high Mulberie with fruite as white as snow, \n Hard by a coole and trickling spring. This bargaine pleasde them both \n And so daylight (which to their thought away but slowly goth) \n Did in the Ocean fall to rest, and night from thence doth rise. \n As soone as darkenesse once was come, straight Thisbe did devise \n A shift to wind hir out of doores, that none that were within \n Perceyved hir: and muffling hir with clothes about hir chin, \n That no man might discerne hir face, to Ninus Tumb she came \n Unto the tree, and sat hir downe there underneath the same. \n Love made hir bold. But see the chaunce, there comes besmerde with blood \n About the chappes a Lionesse all foming from the wood \n From slaughter lately made of kine to staunch hir bloudie thurst \n With water of the foresaid spring. Whome Thisbe spying furst, \n Afarre by moonelight, thereupon with fearfull steppes gan flie, \n And in a darke and yrkesome cave did hide hirselfe thereby. \n And as she fled away for hast she let hir mantle fall \n The whych for feare she left behind not looking backe at all. \n Now when the cruell Lionesse hir thurst had stanched well, \n In going to the Wood she found the slender weede that fell \n From Thisbe, which with bloudie teeth in pieces she did teare. \n The night was somewhat further spent ere Pyramus came there \n Who seeing in the suttle sande the print of Lions paw, \n Waxt pale for feare. But when also the bloudie cloke he saw \n All rent and tome: One night (he sayd) shall lovers two confounde, \n Of which long life deserved she of all that live on ground. \n My soule deserves of this mischaunce the perill for to beare. \n I, wretch, have bene the death of thee, which to this place of feare \n Did cause thee in the night to come, and came not here before. \n My wicked limmes and wretched guttes with cruell teeth therfore \n Devour ye, O ye Lions all that in this rocke doe dwell. \n But Cowardes use to wish for death. The slender weede that fell \n From Thisbe up he takes, and streight doth beare it to the tree, \n Which was appointed erst the place of meeting for to bee. \n And when he had bewept and kist the garment which he knew, \n Receyve thou my bloud too (quoth he) and therewithall he drew \n His sworde, the which among his guttes he thrust, and by and by \n Did draw it from the bleeding wound beginning for to die, \n And cast himselfe upon his backe, the bloud did spin on hie \n As when a Conduite pipe is crackt, the water bursting out \n Doth shote it selfe a great way off and pierce the Ayre about. \n The leaves that were upon the tree besprincled with his blood \n Were died blacke. The roote also bestained as it stoode, \n A deepe darke purple colour straight upon the Berries cast. \n Anon scarce ridded of hir feare with which she was agast, \n For doubt of disapointing him commes Thisbe forth in hast, \n And for hir lover lookes about, rejoycing for to tell \n How hardly she had scapt that night the daunger that befell. \n And as she knew right well the place and facion of the tree \n (As whych she saw so late before): even so when she did see \n The colour of the Berries turnde, she was uncertaine whither \n It were the tree at which they both agreed to meete togither. \n While in this doubtfull stounde she stoode, she cast hir eye aside \n And there beweltred in his bloud hir lover she espide \n Lie sprawling with his dying limmes: at which she started backe, \n And looked pale as any Box, a shuddring through hir stracke, \n Even like the Sea which sodenly with whissing noyse doth move, \n When with a little blast of winde it is but toucht above. \n But when approching nearer him she knew it was hir love, \n She beate hir brest, she shricked out, she tare hir golden heares, \n And taking him betweene hir armes did wash his wounds with teares, \n She meynt hir weeping with his bloud, and kissing all his face \n (Which now became as colde as yse) she cride in wofull case: \n Alas what chaunce, my Pyramus , hath parted thee and mee? \n Make aunswere O my Pyramus : it is thy Thisb', even shee \n Whome thou doste love most heartely, that speaketh unto thee. \n Give eare and rayse thy heavie heade. He hearing Thisbes name, \n Lift up his dying eyes and having seene hir closde the same. \n But when she knew hir mantle there and saw his scabberd lie \n Without the swoorde: Unhappy man thy love hath made thee die: \n Thy love (she said) hath made thee sley thy selfe. This hand of mine \n Is strong inough to doe the like. My love no lesse than thine \n Shall give me force to worke my wound. I will pursue the dead. \n And wretched woman as I am, it shall of me be sed \n That like as of thy death I was the only cause and blame, \n So am I thy companion eke and partner in the same, \n For death which only coulde alas asunder part us twaine, \n Shall never so dissever us but we will meete againe. \n And you the Parentes of us both, most wretched folke alyve, \n Let this request that I shall make in both our names bylive \n Entreate you to permit that we whome chaste and stedfast love \n And whome even death hath joynde in one, may as it doth behove \n In one grave be together layd. And thou unhappie tree \n Which shroudest now the corse of one, and shalt anon through mee \n Shroude two, of this same slaughter holde the sicker signes for ay, \n Blacke be the colour of thy fruite and mourning like alway, \n Such as the murder of us twaine may evermore bewray. \n This said, she tooke the sword yet warme with slaughter of hir love \n And setting it beneath hir brest, did to hir heart it shove. \n Hir prayer with the Gods and with their Parentes tooke effect. \n For when the frute is throughly ripe, the Berrie is bespect \n With colour tending to a blacke. And that which after fire \n Remained, rested in one Tumbe as Thisbe did desire.\n\n \n",
            "2":"\n\n This tale thus tolde a little space of pawsing was betwist, \n And then began Leucothoe thus, hir sisters being whist: \n This Sunne that with his streaming light al worldly things doth cheare \n Was tane in love. Of Phebus loves now list and you shall heare. \n It is reported that this God did first of all espie, \n (For everie thing in Heaven and Earth is open to his eie) \n How Venus with the warlike Mars advoutrie did commit. \n It grieved him to see the fact and so discovered it, \n He shewed hir husband Junos sonne th'advoutrie and the place \n In which this privie scape was done. Who was in such a case \n That heart and hand and all did faile in working for a space. \n Anon he featly forgde a net of Wire so fine and slight, \n That neyther knot nor nooze therein apparant was to sight. \n This piece of worke was much more fine than any handwarpe oofe \n Or that whereby the Spider hanges in sliding from the roofe. \n And furthermore the suttlenesse and slight thereof was such, \n It followed every little pull and closde with every touch, \n And so he set it handsomly about the haunted couch. \n Now when that Venus and hir mate were met in bed togither \n Hir husband by his newfound snare before convayed thither \n Did snarle them both togither fast in middes of all theyr play \n And setting ope the Ivorie doores, callde all the Gods streight way \n To see them: they with shame inough fast lockt togither lay. \n A certaine God among the rest disposed for to sport \n Did wish that he himselfe also were shamed in that sort. \n The resdue laught and so in heaven there was no talke a while, \n But of this Pageant how the Smith the lovers did beguile. \n Dame Venus highly stomacking this great displeasure, thought \n To be revenged on the part by whome the spight was wrought. \n And like as he hir secret loves and meetings had bewrayd, \n So she with wound of raging love his guerdon to him payd. \n What now avayles (Hyperions sonne) thy forme and beautie bright? \n What now avayle thy glistring eyes with cleare and piercing sight? \n For thou that with thy gleames art wont all countries for to burne, \n Art burnt thy selfe with other gleames that serve not for thy turne. \n And thou that oughtst thy cherefull looke on all things for to shew \n Alonly on Leucothoe doste now the same bestow. \n Thou fastnest on that Maide alone the eyes that thou doste owe \n To all the worlde. Sometime more rathe thou risest in the East, \n Sometime againe thou makste it late before thou fall to reast. \n And for desire to looke on hir, thou often doste prolong \n Our winter nightes. And in thy light thou faylest eke among. \n The fancie of thy faultie minde infectes thy feeble sight, \n And so thou makste mens hearts afrayde by daunting of thy light, \n Thou looxte not pale bycause the globe of Phebe is betweene \n The Earth and thee: but love doth cause this colour to be seene. \n Thou lovest this Leucothoe so far above all other, \n That neyther now for Clymene, for Rhodos , nor the mother \n Of Circe, nor for Clytie (who at that present tyde \n Rejected from thy companie did for thy love abide \n Most grievous torments in hir heart) thou seemest for to care. \n Thou mindest hir so much that all the rest forgotten are. \n Hir mother was Eurynome of all the fragrant clime \n Of Arabie esteemde the flowre of beautie in hir time. \n But when hir daughter came to age the daughter past the mother \n As far in beautie, as before the mother past all other. \n Hir father was king Orchamus and rulde the publike weale \n Of Persey, counted by descent the seventh from auncient Bele. \n Far underneath the Westerne clyme of Hesperus doe runne \n The pastures of the firie steedes that draw the golden Sunne . \n There are they fed with Ambrosie in stead of grasse all night \n Which doth refresh their werie limmes and keepeth them in plight \n To beare their dailie labor out: now while the steedes there take \n Their heavenly foode and night by turne his timely course doth make, \n The God disguised in the shape of Queene Eurynome \n Doth prease within the chamber doore of faire Leucothoe \n His lover, whome amid twelve Maides he found by candlelight \n Yet spinning on hir little Rocke, and went me to hir right. \n And kissing hir as mothers use to kisse their daughters deare, \n Saide: Maydes, withdraw your selves a while and sit not listning here. \n I have a secret thing to talke. The Maides avoyde eche one, \n The God then being with his love in chamber all alone, \n Said: I am he that metes the yeare, that all things doe beholde, \n By whome the Earth doth all things see, the Eye of all the worlde. \n Trust me I am in love with thee. The Ladie was so nipt \n With sodaine feare that from hir hands both rocke and spindle slipt. \n Hir feare became hir wondrous well. He made no mo delayes, \n But turned to his proper shape and tooke hys glistring rayes. \n The damsell being sore abasht at this so straunge a sight, \n And overcome with sodaine feare to see the God so bright, \n Did make no outcrie nor no noyse, but helde hir pacience still, \n And suffred him by forced powre his pleasure to fulfill. \n Hereat did Clytie sore repine. For she beyond all measure \n Was then enamoured of the Sunne : and stung with this displeasure \n That he another Leman had, for verie spight and yre \n She playes the blab, and doth defame Leucothoe to hir Syre . \n He cruell and unmercifull would no excuse accept, \n But holding up hir handes to heaven when tenderly she wept, \n And said it was the Sunne that did the deede against hir will: \n Yet like a savage beast full bent his daughter for to spill, \n He put hir deepe in delved ground, and on hir bodie laide \n A huge great heape of heavie sand. The Sunne full yll appaide \n Did with his beames disperse the sand and made an open way \n To bring thy buried face to light, but such a weight there lay \n Upon thee, that thou couldst not raise thine hand aloft againe, \n And so a corse both voide of bloud and life thou didst remaine. \n There never chaunst since Phaetons fire a thing that grievde so sore \n The ruler of the winged steedes as this did. And therfore \n He did attempt if by the force and vertue of his ray \n He might againe to lively heate hir frozen limmes convay. \n But forasmuch as destenie so great attempts denies, \n He sprincles both the corse it selfe and place wherein it lyes \n With fragrant Nectar. And therewith bewayling much his chaunce \n Sayd: Yet above the starrie skie thou shalt thy selfe advaunce. \n Anon the body in this heavenly liquor steeped well \n Did melt, and moisted all the earth with sweete and pleasant smell. \n And by and by first taking roote among the cloddes within \n By little and by little did with growing top begin \n A pretie spirke of Frankinsence above the Tumbe to win. \n Although that Clytie might excuse hir sorrow by hir love \n And seeme that so to play the blab hir sorrow did hir move, \n Yet would the Author of the light resort to hir no more \n But did withholde the pleasant sportes of Venus usde before. \n The Nymph not able of hir selfe the franticke fume to stay, \n With restlesse care and pensivenesse did pine hir selfe away. \n Bareheaded on the bare cold ground with flaring haire unkempt \n She sate abrode both night and day: and clearly did exempt \n Hirselfe by space of thrise three dayes from sustnance and repast \n Save only dewe and save hir teares with which she brake hir fast. \n And in that while she never rose but stared on the Sunne \n And ever turnde hir face to his as he his corse did runne. \n Hir limmes stacke fast within the ground, and all hir upper part \n Did to a pale ashcolourd herbe cleane voyde of bloud convart. \n The floure whereof part red part white beshadowed with a blew \n Most like a Violet in the shape hir countnance overgrew. \n And now (though fastned with a roote) she turnes hir to the Sunne \n And keepes (in shape of herbe) the love with which she first begunne.\n\n \n",
            "3":"\n\n She made an ende: and at hir tale all wondred: some denide \n Hir saying to be possible: and other some replide \n That such as are in deede true Gods may all things worke at will: \n But Bacchus is not any such. Thys arguing once made still, \n To tell hir tale as others had Alcithoes turne was come. \n Who with hir shettle shooting through hir web within the Loome, \n Said: Of the shepeheird Daphnyes love of Ida whom erewhile \n A jealouse Nymph (bicause he did with Lemans hir beguile) \n For anger turned to a stone (such furie love doth sende: ) \n I will not speake: it is to knowe: ne yet I doe entende \n To tell how Scython variably digressing from his kinde, \n Was sometime woman, sometime man, as liked best his minde. \n And Celmus also wyll I passe, who for bicause he cloong \n Most faithfully to Jupiter when Jupiter was yoong, \n Is now become an Adamant. So will I passe this howre \n To shew you how the Curets were engendred of a showre: \n Or how that Crocus and his love faire Smylax turned were \n To little flowres. With pleasant newes your mindes now will I chere. \n Learne why the fountaine Salmacis diffamed is of yore, \n Why with his waters overstrong it weakeneth men so sore \n That whoso bathes him there commes thence a perfect man no more. \n The operation of this Well is knowne to every wight. \n But few can tell the cause thereof, the which I will recite. \n The waternymphes did nurce a sonne of Mercuries in Ide \n Begot on Venus, in whose face such beautie did abide, \n As well therein his father both and mother might be knowne, \n Of whome he also tooke his name. As soone as he was growne \n To fiftene yeares of age, he left the Countrie where he dwelt \n And Ida that had fostered him. The pleasure that he felt \n To travell Countries, and to see straunge rivers with the state \n Of forren landes, all painfulnesse of travell did abate. \n He travelde through the lande of Lycie to Carie that doth bound \n Next unto Lycia . There he saw a Poole which to the ground \n Was Christall cleare. No fennie sedge, no barren reeke, no reede \n Nor rush with pricking poynt was there, nor other moorish weede. \n The water was so pure and shere a man might well have seene \n And numbred all the gravell stones that in the bottome beene. \n The utmost borders from the brim environd were with clowres \n Beclad with herbes ay fresh and greene and pleasant smelling flowres. \n A Nymph did haunt this goodly Poole: but such a Nymph as neyther \n To hunt, to run, nor yet to shoote, had any kinde of pleasure. \n Of all the Waterfairies she alonly was unknowne \n To swift Diana. As the bruit of fame abrode hath blowne, \n Hir sisters oftentimes would say: take lightsome Dart or bow, \n And in some painefull exercise thine ydle time bestow. \n But never could they hir persuade to runne, to shoote or hunt, \n Or any other exercise as Phebes knightes are wont. \n Sometime hir faire welformed limbes she batheth in hir spring: \n Sometime she downe hir golden haire with Boxen combe doth bring. \n And at the water as a glasse she taketh counsell ay \n How every thing becommeth hir. Erewhile in fine aray \n On soft sweete hearbes or soft greene leaves hir selfe she nicely layes: \n Erewhile againe a gathering flowres from place to place she strayes. \n And (as it chaunst) the selfesame time she was a sorting gayes \n To make a Poisie, when she first the yongman did espie, \n And in beholding him desirde to have his companie. \n But though she thought she stoode on thornes untill she went to him: \n Yet went she not before she had bedect hir neat and trim, \n And pride and peerd upon hir clothes that nothing sat awrie, \n And framde hir countnance as might seeme most amrous to the eie. \n Which done she thus begon: O childe most worthie for to bee \n Estemde and taken for a God, if (as thou seemste to mee) \n Thou be a God, to Cupids name thy beautie doth agree. \n Or if thou be a mortall wight, right happie folke are they, \n By whome thou camste into this worlde, right happy is (I say) \n Thy mother and thy sister too (if any bee): good hap \n That woman had that was thy Nurce and gave thy mouth hir pap. \n But farre above all other, far more blist than these is shee \n Whome thou vouchsafest for thy wife and bedfellow for to bee. \n Now if thou have alredy one, let me by stelth obtaine \n That which shall pleasure both of us. Or if thou doe remaine \n A Maiden free from wedlocke bonde, let me then be thy spouse, \n And let us in the bridelie bed our selves togither rouse. \n This sed, the Nymph did hold hir peace, and therewithall the boy \n Waxt red: he wist not what love was: and sure it was a joy \n To see it how exceeding well his blushing him became. \n For in his face the colour fresh appeared like the same \n That is in Apples which doe hang upon the Sunnie side: \n Or Ivorie shadowed with a red: or such as is espide \n Of white and scarlet colours mixt appearing in the Moone \n When folke in vaine with sounding brasse would ease unto hir done. \n When at the last the Nymph desirde most instantly but this, \n As to his sister brotherly to give hir there a kisse, \n And therewithall was clasping him about the Ivorie necke: \n Leave off (quoth he) or I am gone and leave thee at a becke \n With all thy trickes. Then Salmacis began to be afraide, \n And, To your pleasure leave I free this place, my friend, she sayde. \n Wyth that she turnes hir backe as though she would have gone hir way: \n But evermore she looketh backe, and (closely as she may) \n She hides hir in a bushie queach, where kneeling on hir knee \n She alwayes hath hir eye on him. He as a childe and free, \n And thinking not that any wight had watched what he did \n Romes up and downe the pleasant Mede: and by and by amid \n The flattring waves he dippes his feete, no more but first the sole \n And to the ancles afterward both feete he plungeth whole. \n And for to make the matter short, he tooke so great delight \n In coolenesse of the pleasant spring, that streight he stripped quight \n His garments from his tender skin. When Salmacis behilde \n His naked beautie, such strong pangs so ardently hir hilde, \n That utterly she was astraught. And even as Phebus beames \n Against a myrrour pure and clere rebound with broken gleames: \n Even so hir eys did sparcle fire. Scarce could she tarience make: \n Scarce could she any time delay hir pleasure for to take: \n She wolde have run, and in hir armes embraced him streight way: \n She was so far beside hir selfe, that scarsly could she stay. \n He clapping with his hollow hands against his naked sides, \n Into the water lithe and baine with armes displayed glydes. \n And rowing with his hands and legges swimmes in the water cleare: \n Through which his bodie faire and white doth glistringly appeare, \n As if a man an Ivorie Image or a Lillie white \n Should overlay or close with glasse that were most pure and bright. \n The prize is won (cride Salmacis aloud) he is mine owne. \n And therewithall in all post hast she having lightly throwne \n Hir garments off, flew to the Poole and cast hir thereinto \n And caught him fast between hir armes, for ought that he could doe: \n Yea maugre all his wrestling and his struggling to and fro, \n She held him still, and kissed him a hundred times and mo. \n And willde he nillde he with hir handes she toucht his naked brest: \n And now on this side now on that (for all he did resist \n And strive to wrest him from hir gripes) she clung unto him fast: \n And wound about him like a Snake which snatched up in hast \n And being by the Prince of Birdes borne lightly up aloft, \n Doth writhe hir selfe about his necke and griping talants oft: \n And cast hir taile about his wings displayed in the winde: \n Or like as Ivie runnes on trees about the utter rinde: \n Or as the Crabfish having caught his enmy in the Seas, \n Doth claspe him in on every side with all his crooked cleas. \n But Atlas Nephew still persistes, and utterly denies \n The Nymph to have hir hoped sport: she urges him likewise. \n And pressing him with all hir weight, fast cleaving to him still, \n Strive, struggle, wrest and writhe (she said) thou froward boy thy fill: \n Doe what thou canst thou shalt not scape. Ye Goddes of Heaven agree \n That this same wilfull boy and I may never parted bee.\n\n \n",
            "4":"\n\n The Gods were pliant to hir boone. The bodies of them twaine \n Were mixt and joyned both in one. To both them did remaine \n One countnance: like as if a man should in one barke beholde \n Two twigges both growing into one and still togither holde. \n Even so when through hir hugging and hir grasping of the tother \n The members of them mingled were and fastned both togither, \n They were not any lenger two: but (as it were) a toy \n Of double shape. Ye could not say it was a perfect boy \n Nor perfect wench: it seemed both and none of both to beene. \n Now when Hermaphroditus saw how in the water sheene \n To which he entred in a man, his limmes were weakened so \n That out fro thence but halfe a man he was compelde to go, \n He lifteth up his hands and said (but not with manly reere): \n O noble father Mercurie, and Venus mother deere, \n This one petition graunt your son which both your names doth beare, \n That whoso commes within this Well may so be weakened there, \n That of a man but halfe a man he may fro thence retire. \n Both Parentes moved with the chaunce did stablish this desire \n The which their doubleshaped sonne had made: and thereupon \n Infected with an unknowne strength the sacred spring anon. \n Their tales did ende and Mineus daughters still their businesse plie \n In spight of Bacchus whose high feast they breake contemptuously. \n When on the sodaine (seeing nought) they heard about them round \n Of tubbish Timbrels perfectly a hoarse and jarring sound, \n With shraming shalmes and gingling belles, and furthermore they felt \n A cent of Saffron and of Myrrhe that verie hotly smelt. \n And (which a man would ill beleve) the web they had begun \n Immediatly waxt fresh and greene, the flaxe the which they spun \n Did flourish full of Ivie leaves. And part thereof did run \n Abrode in Vines. The threede it selfe in braunches forth did spring. \n Yong burgeons full of clustred grapes their Distaves forth did bring. \n And as the web they wrought was dide a deepe darke purple hew, \n Even so upon the painted grapes the selfesame colour grew. \n The day was spent, and now was come the time which neyther night \n Nor day, but even the bound of both a man may terme of right. \n The house at sodaine seemde to shake, and all about it shine \n With burning lampes, and glittering fires to flash before their eyen, \n And Likenesses of ougly beastes with gastfull noyses yeld. \n For feare whereof in smokie holes the sisters were compeld \n To hide their heades, one here and there another, for to shun \n The glistring light. And while they thus in corners blindly run, \n Upon their little pretie limmes a fine crispe filme there goes, \n And slender finnes in stead of handes their shortned armes enclose. \n But how they lost their former shape of certaintie to know \n The darknesse would not suffer them. No feathers on them grow, \n And yet with shere and velume wings they hover from the ground \n And when they goe about to speake they make but little sound, \n According as their bodies give, bewayling their despight \n By chirping shirlly to themselves. In houses they delight \n And not in woods: detesting day they flitter towards night: \n Wherethrough they of the Evening late in Latin take their name, \n And we in English language Backes or Reermice call the same.\n\n \n",
            "5":"\n\n Then Bacchus name was reverenced through all the Theban coast, \n And Ino of hir Nephewes powre made every where great boast. \n Of Cadmus daughters she alone no sorowes tasted had, \n Save only that hir sisters haps perchaunce had made hir sad. \n Now Juno noting how she waxt both proud and full of scorne, \n As well by reason of the sonnes and daughters she had borne, \n As also that she was advaunst by mariage in that towne \n To Athamas, King Aeolus sonne, a Prince of great renowne, \n But chiefly that hir sisters sonne who nourced was by hir \n Was then exalted for a God: began thereat to stir, \n And freating at it in hirselfe said: Coulde this harlots burd \n Transforme the Lydian watermen, and drowne them in the foord? \n And make the mother teare the guttes in pieces of hir sonne? \n And Mineus al three daughters clad with wings, bicause they sponne \n Whiles others howling up and down like frantick folke did ronne? \n And can I Juno nothing else save sundrie woes bewaile? \n Is that sufficient? can my powre no more than so availe? \n He teaches me what way to worke. A man may take (I see) \n Example at his enmies hand the wiser for to bee. \n He shewes inough and overmuch the force of furious wrath \n By Pentheys death: why should not Ine be taught to tread the path \n The which hir sisters heretofore and kinred troden hath? \n There is a steepe and irksome way obscure with shadow fell \n Of balefull yewgh, all sad and still, that leadeth downe to hell. \n The foggie Styx doth breath up mistes: and downe this way doe wave \n The ghostes of persons lately dead and buried in the grave. \n Continuall colde and gastly feare possesse this queachie plot \n On eyther side: the siely Ghost new parted knoweth not \n The way that doth directly leade him to the Stygian Citie \n Or where blacke Pluto keepes his Court that never sheweth pitie. \n A thousand wayes, a thousand gates that alwayes open stand, \n This Citie hath: and as the Sea the streames of all the lande \n Doth swallow in his gredie gulfe, and yet is never full: \n Even so that place devoureth still and hideth in his gull \n The soules and ghostes of all the world: and though that nere so many \n Come thither, yet the place is voyd as if there were not any. \n The ghostes without flesh, bloud, or bones, there wander to and fro, \n Of which some haunt the judgement place: and other come and go \n To Plutos Court: and some frequent the former trades and Artes \n The which they used in their life: and some abide the smartes \n And torments for their wickednesse and other yll desartes. \n So cruell hate and spightfull wrath did boyle in Junos brest, \n That in the high and noble Court of Heaven she coulde not rest: \n But that she needes must hither come: whose feet no sooner toucht \n The thresholde, but it gan to quake. And Cerberus erst coucht \n Start sternely up with three fell heades which barked all togither. \n She callde the daughters of the night, the cruell furies, thither: \n They sate a kembing foule blacke Snakes from off their filthie heare \n Before the dungeon doore, the place where Caitives punisht were, \n The which was made of Adamant. When in the darke in part \n They knew Queene Juno, by and by upon their feete they start. \n There Titius stretched out (at least) nine acres full in length, \n Did with his bowels feede a Grype that tare them out by strength. \n The water fled from Tantalus that toucht his neather lip, \n And Apples hanging over him did ever from him slip. \n There also laborde Sisyphus that drave against the hill \n A rolling stone that from the top came tumbling downeward still. \n Ixion on his restlesse wheele to which his limmes were bound \n Did flie and follow both at once in turning ever round. \n And Danaus daughters forbicause they did their cousins kill, \n Drew water into running tubbes which evermore did spill. \n When Juno with a louring looke had vewde them all through- out, \n And on Ixion specially before the other rout, \n She turnes from him to Sisyphus, and with an angry cheere \n Sayes: Wherefore should this man endure continuall penance here, \n And Athamas his brother reigne in welth and pleasure free \n Who through his pride hath ay disdainde my husband Jove and mee? \n And therewithall she poured out th'occasion of hir hate, \n And why she came and what she would. She would that Cadmus state \n Should with the ruine of his house be brought to swyft decay, \n And that to mischiefe Athamas the Fiendes should force some way. \n She biddes, she prayes, she promises, and all is with a breth, \n And moves the furies earnestly: and as these things she seth, \n The hatefull Hag Tisiphone with horie ruffled heare, \n Removing from hir face the Snakes that loosely dangled there, \n Sayd thus: Madame there is no neede long circumstance to make. \n Suppose your will already done. This lothsome place forsake, \n And to the holsome Ayre of heaven your selfe agayne retire. \n Queene Juno went right glad away with graunt of hir desire. \n And as she woulde have entred heaven, the Ladie Iris came \n And purged hir with streaming drops. \n\n \n",
            "6":"\n\n Anon upon the same \n The furious Fiende Tisiphone doth cloth hir out of hand \n In garment streaming gorie bloud, and taketh in hir hand \n A burning Cresset steepte in bloud, and girdeth hir about \n With wreathed Snakes and so goes forth. And at hir going out, \n Feare, terror, grief and pensivenesse for companie she tooke, \n And also madnesse with his flaight, and gastly staring looke. \n Within the house of Athamas no sooner foote she set, \n But that the postes began to quake and doores looke blacke as Jet. \n The sonne withdrew him, Athamas and eke his wife were cast \n With ougly sightes in such a feare, that out of doores agast \n They would have fled. There stoode the Fiend, and stopt their passage out, \n And splaying forth hir filthie armes beknit with Snakes about, \n Did tosse and wave hir hatefull head. The swarme of scaled snakes \n Did make an irksome noyse to heare as she hir tresses shakes. \n About hir shoulders some did craule: some trayling downe hir brest \n Did hisse and spit out poyson greene, and spirt with tongues infest. \n Then from amyd hir haire two snakes with venymd hand she drew \n Of which shee one at Athamas and one at Ino threw. \n The snakes did craule about their breasts, inspiring in their heart \n Most grievous motions of the minde: the bodie had no smart \n Of any wound: it was the minde that felt the cruell stings. \n A poyson made in Syrup wise, shee also with hir brings. \n The filthie fome of Cerberus, the casting of the Snake \n Echidna, bred among the Fennes about the Stygian Lake: \n Desire of gadding foorth abroad: forgetfulnesse of minde: \n Delight in mischiefe: woodnesse: teares: and purpose whole inclinde \n To cruell murther: all the which shee did together grinde: \n And mingling them with new shed bloud had boyled them in brasse, \n And stird them with a Hemblock stalke. Now whyle that Athamas \n And Ino stood and quakte for feare, this poyson ranke and fell \n Shee tourned into both their breastes and made their heartes to swell. \n Then whisking often round about hir head hir balefull brand, \n She made it soone by gathering winde to kindle in hir hand. \n Thus as it were in triumph wise accomplishing hir hest, \n To Duskie Plutos emptie Realme shee gettes hir home to rest, \n And putteth off the snarled Snakes that girded in hir brest. \n Immediatly King Aeolus sonne starke madde comes crying out \n Through all the court: What meane yee Sirs? why go yee not about \n To pitch our toyles within this chace? I saw even nowe here ran \n A Lyon with hir two yong whelpes. And there withall he gan \n To chase his wyfe as if in deede shee had a Lyon beene \n And lyke a Bedlem boystouslie he snatcheth from betweene \n The mothers armes h's little babe Loearchus smyling on him \n And reaching foorth his preatie armes, and floong him fiercely from him \n A twice or thrice as from a slyng: and dasht his tender head \n Against a hard and rugged stone until he sawe him dead. \n The wretched mother (whither griefe did move hir thereunto \n Or that the poyson spred within did force hir so to doe) \n Howld out and frantikly with scattered haire about hir eares \n And with hir little Melicert whome hastely shee beares \n In naked armes she cryeth out, Hoe Bacchus. At the name \n Of Bacchus Juno gan to laugh and scorning sayde in game: \n This guerden loe thy foster child requiteth for the same. \n There hangs a rocke about the Sea the foote whereof is eate \n So hollow with the saltish waves which on the same doe beate, \n That like a house it keepeth off the moysting showers of rayne. \n The toppe is rough and shootes his front amiddes the open mayne. \n Dame Ino (madnesse made hir strong) did climb this cliffe anon \n And headlong downe (without regarde of hurt that hoong thereon) \n Did throwe hir burden and hir selfe, the water where shee dasht \n In sprincling upwarde glisterd red. But Venus sore abasht \n At this hir Neeces great mischaunce without offence or fault, \n Hir Uncle gently thus bespake: O ruler of the hault \n And swelling Seas, O noble Neptune whose dominion large \n Extendeth to the Heaven, whereof the mightie Jove hath charge, \n The thing is great for which I sue. But shewe thou for my sake \n Some mercie on my wretched friends whome in thine endlesse lake \n Thou seest tossed to and fro. Admit thou them among \n The Goddes. Of right even here to mee some favour doth belong \n At least wise if amid the Sea engendred erst I were \n Of Froth, as of the which yet still my pleasaunt name I beare. \n Neptunus graunted hir request, and by and by bereft them \n Of all that ever mortall was. Insted wherof he left them \n A hault and stately majestie: and altring them in hew \n With shape and names most meete for Goddes he did them both endew. \n Leucothoe was the mothers name, Palemon was the sonne. \n The Thebane Ladies following hir as fast as they could runne, \n Did of hir feete perceive the print upon the utter stone. \n And taking it for certaine signe that both were dead and gone, \n In making mone for Cadmus house, they wrang their hands and tare \n Their haire, and rent their clothes, and railde on Juno out of square, \n As nothing just, but more outragious farre than did behove \n In so revenging of hir selfe upon hir husbands love. \n The Goddesse Juno could not beare their railing. And in faith: \n You also will I make to be as witnesses (she sayth) \n Of my outragious crueltie. And so shee did in deede. \n For shee that loved Ino best was following hir with speede \n Into the Sea. But as shee would hir selfe have downeward cast, \n She could not stirre, but to the rock as nailed sticked fast. \n The second as shee knockt hir breast, did feele hir armes wax stiffe. \n Another as shee stretched out hir hands upon the cliffe, \n Was made a stone, and there stoode still ay stretching forth hir hands \n Into the water as before. And as an other standes \n A tearing of hir ruffled lockes, hir fingers hardened were \n And fastned to hir frisled toppe still tearing of hir heare, \n And looke what gesture eche of them was taken in that tide, \n Even in the same transformde to stones, they fastned did abide. \n And some were altered into birds which Cadmies called bee \n And in that goolfe with flittering wings still to and fro doe flee.\n\n \n",
            "7":"\n\n Nought knoweth Cadmus that his daughter and hir little childe \n Admitted were among the Goddes that rule the surges wilde. \n Compellde with griefe and great mishappes that had ensewd togither, \n And straunge foretokens often seene since first his comming thither, \n He utterly forsakes his towne the which he builded had, \n As though the fortune of the place so hardly him bestad, \n And not his owne. And fleeting long like pilgrims, at the last \n Upon the coast of Illirie his wife and he were cast. \n Where ny forpind with cares and yeares, while of the chaunces past \n Upon their house, and of their toyles and former travails tane \n They sadly talkt betweene themselves: Was my speare head the bane \n Of that same ougly Snake of Mars (quoth Cadmus ) when I fled \n From Sidon ? or did I his teeth in ploughed pasture spred? \n If for the death of him the Goddes so cruell vengeaunce take, \n Drawen out in length upon my wombe then traile I like a snake. \n He had no sooner sayde the worde but that he gan to glide \n Upon his belly like a Snake. And on his hardened side \n He felt the scales new budding out, the which was wholy fret \n With speccled droppes of blacke and gray as thicke as could be set. \n He falleth groveling on his breast, and both his shankes doe growe \n In one round spindle Bodkinwise with sharpned point below. \n His armes as yet remayned still: his armes that did remayne, \n He stretched out, and sayde with teares that plentuously did raine \n Adowne his face, which yet did keepe the native fashion sownd: \n Come hither wyfe, come hither wight most wretched on the ground, \n And whyle that ought of mee remaynes vouchsafe to touche the same. \n Come take mee by the hand as long as hand may have his name, \n Before this snakish shape doe whole my body over runne. \n He would have spoken more when sodainely his tongue begunne \n To split in two and speache did fayle: and as he did attempt \n To make his mone, he hist: for nature now had cleane exempt \n All other speach. His wretched wyfe hir naked stomack beete \n And cryde: What meaneth this? deare Cadmus , where are now thy feete? \n Where are thy shoulders and thy handes? thy hew and manly face? \n With all the other things that did thy princely person grace \n Which nowe I overpasse? But why yee Goddes doe you delay \n My bodie into lyke misshape of Serpent to convay? \n When this was spoken, Cadmus lickt his wyfe about the lippes: \n And (as a place with which he was acquaynted well) he slippes \n Into hir boosome, lovingly embracing hir, and cast \n Himselfe about hir necke, as oft he had in tyme forepast. \n Such as were there (their folke were there) were flaighted at the sight, \n For by and by they sawe their neckes did glister slicke and bright. \n And on their snakish heades grew crests: and finally they both \n Were into verie Dragons tournd, and foorth together goth \n T'one trayling by the tothers side, untill they gaynd a wood, \n The which direct against the place where as they were then stood. \n And now remembring what they were themselves in tymes forepast, \n They neyther shonne nor hurten men with stinging nor with blast.\n\n \n",

And as he overflew \n The Lybicke sandes, the droppes of bloud that from the head did sew \n Of Gorgon being new cut off, upon the ground did fal. \n Which taking them (and as it were conceyving therwithall) \n Engendred sundrie Snakes and wormes: by meanes wherof that clyme \n Did swarme with Serpents ever since, even to this present tyme. \n From thence he lyke a watrie cloud was caried with the weather, \n Through all the heaven, now here, now there as light as any feather. \n And from aloft he viewes the earth that underneath doth lie, \n And swiftly over all the worlde doth in conclusion flie, \n Three times the chilling Beares, three times the Crabbes fel cleas he saw: \n Oft times to Weast, oftimes to East did drive him many a flaw. \n Now at such time as unto rest the sonne began to drawe, \n Bicause he did not thinke it good to be abroad all night, \n Within King Atlas western Realme he ceased from his flight, \n Requesting that a little space of rest enjoy he might, \n Untill such tyme as Lucifer should bring the morning gray, \n And morning bring the lightsome Sunne that guides the cherefull day. \n This Atlas, Japets Nephewe, was a man that did excell \n In stature everie other wight that in the worlde did dwell. \n The utmost coast of all the earth and all that Sea wherein \n The tyred steedes and wearied Wayne of Phoebus dived bin, \n Were in subjection to this King. A thousande flockes of sheepe, \n A thousand heirdes of Rother beastes he in his fields did keepe: \n And not a neighbor did anoy his ground by dwelling nie. \n To him the wandring Persey thus his language did applie: \n If high renowne of royall race thy noble heart may move, \n I am the sonne of Jove himselfe: or if thou more approve \n The valiant deedes and hault exploytes, thou shalt perceive in mee \n Such doings as deserve with prayse extolled for to bee. \n I pray thee of thy courtesie receive mee as thy guest, \n And let mee only for this night within thy palace rest. \n King Atlas called straight to minde an auncient prophesie \n Made by Parnassian Themys, which this sentence did implie: \n The time shall one day, Atlas, come in which thy golden tree \n Shall of hir fayre and precious fruite dispoyld and robbed bee. \n And he shall be the sonne of Jove that shall enjoy the pray. \n For feare hereof he did enclose his Orchard everie way \n With mightie hilles, and put an ougly Dragon in the same \n To keepe it. Further he forbad that any straunger came \n Within his Realme, and to this knight he sayde presumtuouslie: \n Avoyd my land, onlesse thou wilt by utter perill trie \n That all thy glorious actes whereof thou doest so loudly lie \n And Jove thy father be too farre to helpe thee at thy neede. \n To these his wordes he added force, and went about in deede \n To drive him out by strength of hand. To speake was losse of winde \n For neyther could intreating faire nor stoutnesse tourne his minde. \n Well then (quoth Persey ) sith thou doest mine honour set so light, \n Take here a present: and with that he turnes away his sight, \n And from his left side drewe mee out Medusas lothly head. \n As huge and big as Atlas was he tourned in that stead \n Into a mountaine: into trees his beard and locks did passe: \n His hands and shoulders made the ridge: that part which lately was \n His head, became the highest top of all the hill: his bones \n Were turnd to stones: and therewithall he grew mee all at once \n Beyond all measure up in heighth (for so God thought it best) \n So farre that Heaven with all the starres did on his shoulders rest. \n In endlesse prison by that time had Aeolus lockt the wind \n And now the cheerely morning starre that putteth folke in mind \n To rise about their daylie worke shone brightly in the skie. \n Then Persey unto both his feete did streight his feathers tie \n And girt his Woodknife to his side, and from the earth did stie. \n And leaving nations nomberlesse beneath him everie way \n At last upon King Cepheyes fields in Aethiop did he stay. \n Where cleane against all right and law by Joves commaundement \n Andromad for hir mothers tongue did suffer punishment. \n Whome to a rocke by both the armes when fastned hee had seene, \n He would have thought of Marble stone shee had some image beene, \n But that hir tresses to and fro the whisking winde did blowe, \n And trickling teares warme from hir eyes adowne hir cheeks did flow, \n Unwares hereat gan secret sparkes within his breast to glow. \n His wits were straught at sight thereof and ravisht in such wise, \n That how to hover with his wings he scarsly could devise. \n As soone as he had stayd himselfe: O Ladie faire (quoth hee) \n Not worthie of such bands as these, but such wherewith we see \n Togither knit in lawfull bed the earnest lovers bee, \n I pray thee tell mee what thy selfe and what this lande is named \n And wherefore thou dost weare these Chains. The Ladie ill ashamed \n Was at the sodaine striken domb: and lyke a fearfull maid \n Shee durst not speake unto a man. Had not hir handes beene staid \n She would have hid hir bashfull face. Howbeit as she might \n With great abundance of hir teares shee stopped up hir sight \n But when that Persey oftentimes was earnestly in hand \n To learne this matter, for bicause shee would not seeme to stand \n In stubborne silence of hir faultes, shee tolde him what the land \n And what she hight: and how hir mother for hir beauties sake \n Through pride did unadvisedly too much upon hir take. \n And ere shee full had made an ende, the water gan to rore: \n An ougly monster from the deepe was making to the shore \n Which bare the Sea before his breast. The Virgin shrieked out. \n Hir father and hir mother both stood mourning thereabout, \n In wretched ease both twaine, but not so wretched as the maid \n Who wrongly for hir mothers fault the bitter raunsome paid. \n They brought not with them any help: but (as the time and cace \n Requird) they wept and wrang their hands, and streightly did embrace \n Hir bodie fastened to the rock. Then Persey them bespake, \n And sayde: The time may serve too long this sorrow for to make: \n But time of helpe must eyther now or never else be take. \n Now if I, Persey , sonne of hir whome in hir fathers towre \n The mightie Jove begat with childe in shape of golden showre, \n Who cut off ougly Gorgons head bespred with snakish heare, \n And in the ayre durst trust these winges my body for to beare, \n perchaunce should save your daughters life, I think ye should as then \n Accept mee for your sonne in lawe before all other men. \n To these great thewes (by the help of God) I purpose for to adde \n A just desert in helping hir that is so hard bestadde. \n I covenaunt with you by my force and manhod for to save hir, \n Conditionly that to my wife in recompence I have hir. \n Hir parents tooke his offer streight: for who would sticke thereat? \n And praid him faire, and promisde him that for performing that \n They would endow him with the ryght of al their Realme beeside.\n\n \n",
            "9":"\n\n Like as a Gally with hir nose doth cut the waters wide, \n Enforced by the sweating armes of Rowers wyth the tide \n Even so the monster with his brest did beare the waves aside, \n And was now come as neere the rocke as well a man myght fling \n Amid the pure and vacant aire a pellet from a sling. \n When on the sodaine Persey pusht his foote against the ground, \n And stied upward to the clouds his shadow did rebound \n Upon the sea: the beast ran fierce upon the passing shade. \n And as an Egle when he sees a Dragon in a glade \n Lie beaking of his blewish backe against the sunnie rayes, \n Doth seize upon him unbeware, and with his talants layes \n Sure holde upon his scalie necke lest writhing back his head \n His cruell teeth might doe him harme: so Persey in that stead \n Discending downe the ayre amaine with all his force and might \n Did seize upon the monsters backe: and underneath the right \n Finne hard unto the verie hilt his hooked sworde did smight. \n The monster being wounded sore did sometime leape aloft, \n And sometime under water dive, bestirring him full oft \n As doth a chaufed Boare beset with barking Dogges about. \n But Persey with his lightsome wings still keeping him without \n The monsters reach, with hooked sword doth sometime hew his back \n Where as the hollow scales give way: and sometime he doth hacke \n The ribbes on both his maled sides: and sometime he doth wound \n His spindle tayle where into fish it growes most smal and round. \n The Whale at Persey from his mouth such waves of water cast, \n Bemixed with the purple bloud, that all bedreint at last \n His feathers verie heavie were: and doubting any more \n To trust his wings now waxing wet, he straight began to sore \n Up to a rocke which in the calme above the water stood: \n But in the tempest evermore was hidden with the flood. \n And leaning thereunto and with his left hand holding just \n The top thereof a dozen times his weapon he did thrust \n Among his guttes. The joyfull noyse and clapping of their hands \n The which were made for loosening of Andromad from hir bands, \n Filde all the coast and heaven it selfe. The parents of the Maide \n Cassiope and Cepheus were glad and well appayde: \n And calling him their sonne in law confessed him to bee \n The helpe and savegarde of their house. Andromade the fee \n And cause of Perseys enterprise from bondes now beyng free, \n He washed his victorious hands. And lest the Snakie heade \n With lying on the gravell hard should catch some harme, he spred \n Soft leaves and certaine tender twigs that in the water grew, \n And laid Medusas head thereon: the twigs yet being new \n And quicke and full of juicie pith full lightly to them drew \n The nature of this monstrous head. For both the leafe and bough \n Full straungely at the touch thereof became both hard and tough. \n The Sea nymphes tride this wondrous fact in divers other roddes \n And were full glad to see the chaunge, bicause there was no oddes \n Of leaves or twigs or of the seedes new shaken from the coddes. \n For still like nature ever since is in our Corall founde: \n That looke how soone it toucheth Ayre it waxeth hard and sounde, \n And that which under water was a sticke, above is stone. \n Three altars to as many Gods he makes of Turfe anon: \n Upon the left hand Mercuries: Minervas on the right: \n And in the middle Jupiters: to Pallas he did dight \n A Cow: a Calfe to Mercurie: a Bull to royall Jove. \n Forthwith he tooke Andromade the price for which he strove \n Endowed with hir fathers Realme. For now the God of Love \n And Hymen unto mariage his minde in hast did move. \n Great fires were made of sweete perfumes, and curious garlandes hung \n About the house, which every where of mirthful musicke rung \n The gladsome signe of merie mindes. The Pallace gates were set \n Wide open. None from comming in were by the Porters let. \n All Noblemen and Gentlemen that were of any port \n To this same great and royall feast of Cephey did resort. \n When having taken their repast as well of meate as wine \n Their hearts began to pleasant mirth by leysure to encline, \n The valiant Persey of the folke and facions of the land \n Began to be inquisitive. One Lincide out of hand \n The rites and manners of the folke did doe him t'understand. \n Which done he sayd: O worthie knight I pray thee tell us by \n What force or wile thou gotst the head with haires of Adders slie. \n Then Persey tolde how underneath colde Atlas lay a plaine \n So fenced in on every side with mountaines high, that vaine \n Were any force to win the same. In entrance of the which \n Two daughters of King Phorcis dwelt whose chaunce and hap was such \n That one eye served both their turnes: whereof by wilie slight \n And stealth in putting forth his hand he did bereve them quight, \n As they from t'one to tother were delivering of the same. \n From whence by long blind crooked wayes unhandsomly he came \n Through gastly groves by ragged cliffes unto the drerie place \n Whereas the Gorgons dwelt: and there he saw (a wretched case) \n The shapes as well of men as beasts lie scattered everie where \n In open fields and common wayes, the which transformed were \n From living things to stones at sight of foule Medusas heare, \n But yet that he through brightnesse of his monstrous brazen shield \n The which he in his left hand bare, Medusas face beheld. \n And while that in a sound dead sleepe were all hir Snakes and she, \n He softly pared off hir head: and how that he did see \n Swift Pegasus the winged horse and eke his brother grow \n Out of their mothers new shed bloud. Moreover he did show \n A long discourse of all his happes and not so long as trew: \n As namely of what Seas and landes the coasts he overflew, \n And eke what starres with stying wings he in the while did vew. \n But yet his tale was at an ende ere any lookt therefore. \n Upon occasion by and by of wordes reherst before \n There was a certaine noble man demaunded him wherefore \n Shee only of the sisters three haire mixt with Adders bore. \n Sir (aunswerde Persey ) sith you aske a matter worth report \n I graunt to tell you your demaunde. She both in comly port \n And beautie, every other wight surmounted in such sort, \n That many suters unto hir did earnestly resort. \n And though that whole from top to toe most bewtifull she were, \n In all hir bodie was no part more goodly than hir heare. \n I know some parties yet alive, that say they did hir see. \n It is reported how she should abusde by Neptune bee \n In Pallas Church: from which fowle facte Joves daughter turnde hir eye, \n And with hir Target hid hir face from such a villanie. \n And lest it should unpunisht be, she turnde hir seemely heare \n To lothly Snakes: the which (the more to put hir foes in feare) \n Before hir brest continually she in her shield doth beare. \n"

This sodaine chaunge from feasting unto fray \n Might well be likened to the Sea: whych standing at a stay \n The woodnesse of the windes makes rough by raising of the wave. \n King Cepheys brother Phyney was the man that rashly gave \n The first occasion of this fray. Who shaking in hys hand \n A Dart of Ash with head of steele, sayd: Loe: loe here I stand \n To chalenge thee that wrongfully my ravisht spouse doste holde. \n Thy wings nor yet thy forged Dad in shape of feyned golde \n Shall now not save thee from my handes. As with that word he bent \n His arme aloft, the foresaid Dart at Persey to have sent, \n What doste thou brother (Cephey cride) what madnesse moves thy minde \n To doe so foule a deede? is this the friendship he shall finde \n Among us for his good deserts? And wilt thou needes requite \n The saving of thy Neeces life with such a foule despight? \n Whome Persey hath not from thee tane: but (if thou be advisde) \n But Neptunes heavie wrath bicause his Sea nymphes were despisde: \n But horned Hammon : but the beast which from the Sea arrived \n On my deare bowels for to feede. That time wert thou deprived \n Of thy betroothed, when hir life upon the losing stoode: \n Onlesse perchaunce to see hir lost it woulde have done thee good, \n And easde thy heart to see me sad. And may it not suffice \n That thou didst see hir to the rocke fast bound before thine eyes \n And didst not helpe hir beyng both hir husband and hir Eame? \n Onlesse thou grudge that any man should come within my Realme \n To save hir life, and seeke to rob him of his just rewarde? \n Which if thou thinke to be so great, thou shouldst have had regarde \n Before, to fetch it from the rocke to which thou sawste it bound. \n I pray thee, brother, seeing that by him the meanes is found \n That in mine age without my childe I go not to the grounde, \n Permit him to enjoy the price for which we did compounde, \n And which he hath by due desert of purchace deerely bought. \n For brother, let it never sinke nor enter in thy thought \n That I set more by him than thee: but this may well be sed \n I rather had to give hir him than see my daughter dead. \n He gave him not a worde againe: but looked eft on him, \n And eft on Persey irefully with countnance stoure and grim, \n Not knowing which were best to hit: and after little stay \n He shooke his Dart, and flung it forth with all the powre and sway \n That Anger gave at Perseys head. But harme it did him none, \n It sticked in the Bedsteddes head that Persey sate upon. \n Then Persey sternely starting up and pulling out the Dart \n Did throw it at his foe agayne, and therewithall his hart \n Had cliven asunder, had he not behinde an Altar start. \n The Altar (more the pitie was) did save the wicked wight. \n Yet threw he not the Dart in vaine: it hit one Rhetus right \n Amid the foreheade: who therewith sanke downe, and when the steele \n Was plucked out, he sprawlde about and spurned with his heele, \n And all berayd the boorde with bloud. Then all the other rout \n As fierce as fire flang Dartes: and some there were that cried out \n That Cephey with his sonne in lawe was worthy for to die. \n But he had wound him out of doores protesting solemly \n As he was just and faithfull Prince, and swearing eke by all \n The Gods of Hospitalitie, that that same broyle did fall \n Full sore against his will. At hand was warlie Pallas streight \n And shadowed Persey with hir shielde, and gave him heart in feight. \n There was one Atys borne in Inde , (of faire Lymniace \n The River Ganges daughter thought the issue for to be), \n Of passing beautie which with rich aray he did augment. \n He ware that day a scarlet Cloke, about the which there went \n A garde of golde: a cheyne of golde he ware about his necke: \n And eke his haire perfumde with Myrrhe a costly crowne did decke. \n Full sixtene yeares he was of age: such cunning skill he coulde \n In darting, as to hit his marke farre distant when he would. \n Yet how to handle Bow and shaftes much better did he know. \n Now as he was about that time to bende his horned Bowe, \n A firebrand Persey raught that did upon the Aultar smoke, \n And dasht him overtwhart the face with such a violent stroke, \n That all bebattred was his head, the bones asunder broke. \n When Lycabas of Assur lande, his moste assured friend \n And deare companion, being no dissembler of his miend, \n Which most entierly did him love, behelde him on the ground \n Lie weltring with disfigurde face, and through that grievous wound \n Now gasping out his parting ghost, his death he did lament, \n And taking hastly up the Bow that Atys erst had bent: \n Encounter thou with me (he saide) thou shalt not long enjoy \n Thy triumphing in braverie thus, for killing of this boy, \n By which thou getst more spight than praise. All this was scarsly sed, \n But that the arrow from the string went streyned to the head. \n Howbeit Persey (as it hapt) so warely did it shunne, \n As that it in his coteplights hung. Then to him did he runne \n With Harpe in his hand bestaind with grim Medusas blood, \n And thrust him through the brest therwith. He quothing as he stood \n Did looke about where Atys lay with dim and dazeling eyes, \n Now waving under endlesse night: and downe by him he lies, \n And for to comfort him withall togither with him dies.\n\n \n",
            "1":"\n\n Behold through gredie haste to feight one Phorbas, Methions son, \n A Swevite: and of Lybie lande one callde Amphimedon \n By fortune sliding in the blood with which the ground was wet, \n Fell downe: and as they woulde have rose, Perseus fauchon met \n With both of them. Amphimedon upon the ribbes he smote, \n And with the like celeritie he cut me Phorbas throte. \n But unto Erith , Actors sonne, that in his hand did holde \n A brode browne Bill, with his short sword he durst not be too bolde \n To make approch. With both his handes a great and massie cup \n Embost with cunning portrayture aloft he taketh up, \n And sendes it at him. He spewes up red bloud: and falling downe o \n Upon his backe, against the ground doth knocke his dying crowne. \n Then downe he Polydemon throwes, extract of royall race, \n And Abaris the Scithian, and Clytus in like case, \n And Elice with his unshorne lockes, and also Phlegias, \n And Lycet, olde Sperchesies sonne, with divers other mo, \n That on the heapes of corses slaine he treades as he doth go. \n And Phyney daring not presume to meet his foe at hand, \n Did cast a Dart: which hapt to light on Idas who did stand \n Aloofe as neuter (though in vaine) not medling with the Fray. \n Who casting backe a frowning looke at Phyney, thus did say: \n Sith whether that I will or no compeld I am perforce \n To take a part, have Phyney here him whome thou doste enforce \n To be thy foe, and with this wound my wrongfull wound requite. \n But as he from his body pullde the Dart, with all his might \n To throw it at his foe againe, his limmes so feebled were \n With losse of bloud, that downe he fell and could not after steare. \n There also lay Odites slaine the chiefe in all the land \n Next to King Cephey, put to death by force of Clymens hand. \n Protenor was by Hypsey killde, and Lyncide did as much \n For Hypsey. In the throng there was an auncient man and such \n A one as loved righteousnesse and greatly feared God: \n Emathion called was his name: whome sith his yeares forbad \n To put on armes, he feights with tongue, inveying earnestly \n Against that wicked war the which he banned bitterly. \n As on the Altar he himselfe with quivering handes did stay, \n One Cromis tipped off his head: his head cut off streight way \n Upon the Altar fell, and there his tongue not fully dead \n Did bable still the banning wordes the which it erst had sed, \n And breathed forth his fainting ghost among the burning brandes. \n Then Brote and Hammon brothers, twins, stout champions of their hands \n In wrestling Pierlesse (if so be that wrestling could sustaine \n The furious force of slicing swordes) were both by Phyney slaine. \n And so was Alphit, Ceres Priest, that ware upon his crowne \n A stately Miter faire and white with Tables hanging downe. \n Thou also Japets sonne for such affaires as these unmeete \n But meete to tune thine instrument with voyce and Ditie sweete, \n The worke of peace, wert thither callde th'assemblie to rejoyce \n And for to set the mariage forth with pleasant singing voyce. \n As with his Violl in his hand he stoode a good way off, \n There commeth to him Petalus and sayes in way of scoffe: \n Go sing the resdue to the ghostes about the Stygian Lake, \n And in the left side of his heade his dagger poynt he strake. \n He sanke downe deade with fingers still yet warbling on the string \n And so mischaunce knit up with wo the song that he did sing. \n But fierce Lycormas could not beare to see him murdred so \n Without revengement. Up he caught a mightie Leaver tho \n That wonted was to barre the doore a right side of the house \n And therewithall to Petalus he lendeth such a souse \n Full in the noddle of the necke, that like a snetched Oxe \n Streight tumbling downe, against the ground his groveling face he knox. \n And Pelates, a Garamant, attempted to have caught \n The left doore barre: but as thereat with stretched hand he raught, \n One Coryt, sonne of Marmarus did with a Javelin stricke \n Him through the hand, that to the wood fast nayled did it sticke. \n As Pelates stoode fastned thus, one Abas goard his side: \n He could not fall, but hanging still upon the poste there dide \n Fast nayled by the hand. And there was overthrowne a Knight \n Of Perseyes band callde Melaney, and one that Dorill hight, \n A man of greatest landes in all the Realme of Nasamone. \n That occupide so large a grounde as Dorill was there none, \n ' Nor none that had such store of come. There came a Dart askew \n And lighted in his Coddes, the place where present death doth sew. \n When Alcion of Barcey, he that gave this deadly wound, \n Beheld him yesking forth his ghost and falling to the ground \n With watrie eyes the white turnde up: Content thy selfe, he said, \n With that same litle plot of grounde whereon thy corse is layde, \n In steade of all the large fat fieldes which late thou didst possesse. \n And with that word he left him dead. Perseus to redresse \n This slaughter and this spightfull taunt, streight snatched out the Dart \n That sticked in the fresh warme wound, and with an angrie hart \n Did send it at the throwers head: the Dart did split his nose \n Even in the middes, and at his necke againe the head out goes: \n So that it peered both the wayes. Whiles fortune doth support \n And further Persey thus, he killes (but yet in sundrie sort) \n Two brothers by the mother: t'one callde Clytie, tother Dane . \n For on a Dart through both his thighes did Clytie take his bane: \n And Danus with another Dart was striken in the mouth. \n There died also Celadon, a Gypsie of the South: \n And so did bastard Astrey too, whose mother was a Jew: \n And sage Ethion well foreseene in things that should ensew, \n But utterly beguilde as then by Birdes that aukly flew. \n King Cepheyes harnessebearer callde Thoactes lost his life, \n And Agyrt whom for murdring late his father with a knife \n The worlde spake shame of. Nathelesse much more remainde behinde \n Than was dispatched out of hand: for all were full in minde \n To murder one. The wicked throng had sworne to spend their blood \n Against the right, and such a man as had deserved good. \n A tother side (although in vaine) of mere affection stood \n The Father and the Motherinlaw, and eke the heavie bride, \n Who filled with their piteous playnt the Court on everie side. \n But now the clattring of the swordes and harnesse at that tide \n With grievous grones and sighes of such as wounded were or dide, \n Did raise up such a cruell rore that nothing could be heard. \n For fierce Bellona so renewde the battell afterward, \n That all the house did swim in blood. Duke Phyney with a rout \n Of moe than of a thousand men environd round about \n The valiant Persey all alone. The Dartes of Phyneys bande \n Came thicker than the Winters hayle doth fall upon the lande, \n By both his sides, his eyes and eares. He warely thereupon \n Withdrawes, and leanes his backe against a huge great arche of stone: \n And being safe behind, he settes his face against his foe \n Withstanding all their fierce assaultes. There did assaile him thoe \n Upon the left side Molpheus, a Prince of Choanie. \n And on the right Ethemon, borne hard by in Arabie. \n Like as the Tyger when he heares the lowing out of Neate \n In sundrie Medes, enforced sore through abstinence from meate, \n Would faine be doing with them both, and can not tell at which \n Were best to give adventure first: so Persey who did itch \n To be at host with both of them, and doubtfull whether side \n To turne him on, the right or left, upon advantage spide \n Did wound me Molphey on the leg, and from him quight him drave. \n He was contented with his flight: for why Ethemon gave \n No respite to him to pursue: but like a franticke man \n Through egernesse to wounde his necke, without regarding whan \n Or how to strike for haste, he burst his brittle sworde in twaine \n Against the Arche: the poynt whereof rebounding backe againe, \n Did hit himselfe upon the throte. Howbeit that same wound \n Was unsufficient for to sende Ethemon to the ground. \n He trembled holding up his handes for mercie, but in vaine, \n For Persey thrust him through the heart with Hermes hooked skaine. \n\n \n",
            "2":"\n\n But when he saw that valiantnesse no lenger could avayle, \n By reason of the multitude that did him still assayle: \n Sith you your selves me force to call mine enmie to mine ayde, \n I will do so: if any friend of mine be here (he sayd) \n Sirs, turne your faces all away: and therewithall he drew \n Out Gorgons head. One Thessalus streight raging to him flew, \n And sayd: Go seeke some other man whome thou mayst make abasht \n With these thy foolish juggling toyes. And as he would have dasht \n His Javeling in him with that worde to kill him out of hand, \n With gesture throwing forth his Dart all Marble did he stand. \n His sworde through Lyncids noble heart had Amphix thought to shove: \n His hand was stone, and neyther one nor other way could move: \n But Niley who did vaunt himselfe to be the Rivers sonne \n That through the boundes of Aegypt land in channels seven doth runne, \n And in his shielde had graven part of silver, part of golde \n The said seven channels of the Nile , sayd: Persey here beholde \n From whence we fetch our piedegree: it may rejoyce thy hart \n To die of such a noble hand as mine. The latter part \n Of these his words could scarce be heard: the dint therof was drownde: \n Ye would have thought him speaking still with open mouth: but sound \n Did none forth passe: there was for speache no passage to be found. \n Rebuking them cries Eryx : Sirs, it is not Gorgons face, \n It is your owne faint heartes that make you stonie in this case. \n Come let us on this fellow run and to the ground him beare \n That feightes by witchcraft: as with that his feete forth stepping were, \n They stacke still fastened to the floore: he could not move aside, \n An armed image all of stone he speachlesse did abide. \n All these were justly punished. But one there was a knight \n Of Perseys band, in whose defence as Acont stoode to feight, \n He waxed overgrowne with stone at ugly Gorgons sight. \n Whome still as yet Astyages supposing for to live, \n Did with a long sharpe arming sworde a washing blow him give. \n The sword did clinke against the stone and out the sparcles drive. \n While all amazde Astyages stoode wondring at the thing, \n The selfesame nature on himselfe the Gorgons head did bring. \n And in his visage which was stone a countnance did remaine \n Of wondring still. A wearie worke it were to tell you plaine \n The names of all the common sort. Two hundred from that fray \n Did scape unslaine: but none of them did go alive away. \n The whole two hundred every one at sight of Gorgons heare \n Were turned into stockes of stone. Then at the length for feare \n Did Phyney of his wrongfull war forthinke himselfe full sore. \n But now (alas) what remedie? he saw there stand before \n His face, his men like Images in sundrie shapes all stone. \n He knew them well, and by their names did call them everychone: \n Desiring them to succor him: and trusting not his sight \n He feeles the bodies that were next, and all were Marble quight. \n He turnes himselfe from Persey ward and humbly as he standes \n He wries his armes behind his backe: and holding up his handes, \n O noble Persey , thou hast got the upper hand, he sed. \n Put up that monstruous shield of thine: put up that Gorgons head \n That into stones transformeth men: put up, I thee desire. \n Not hatred, nor bicause to reigne as King I did aspire, \n Have moved me to make this fray. The only force of love \n In seeking my betrothed spouse, did hereunto me move. \n The better title seemeth thine bicause of thy desert: \n And mine by former promise made. It irkes me at the heart \n In that I did not give the place. None other thing I crave \n O worthie knight, but that thou graunt this life of mine to save. \n Let all things else beside be thine. As he thus humbly spake \n Nor daring looke at him to whome he did entreatance make, \n The thing (quoth Persey ) which to graunt both I can finde in heart, \n And is no little courtesie to shewe without desert \n Upon a Coward, I will graunt, O fearfull Duke, to thee. \n Set feare aside: thou shalt not hurt with any weapon bee. \n I will moreover so provide as thai thou shalt remaine \n An everlasting monument of this dayes toyle and paine. \n The pallace of my Fathrinlaw shall henceforth be thy shrine \n Where thou shalt stand continually before my spouses eyen, \n That of hir husband having ay the Image in hir sight, \n She may from time to time receyve some comfort and delight. \n He had no sooner sayd these wordes but that he turnde his shielde \n With Gorgons heade to that same part where Phyney with a mielde \n And fearfull countnance set his face. Then also as he wride \n His eyes away, his necke waxt stiffe, his teares to stone were dride. \n A countnance in the stonie stocke of feare did still appeare \n With humble looke and yeelding handes and gastly ruthfull cheare. \n With conquest and a noble wife doth Persey home repaire \n And in revengement of the right against the wrongfull heyre, \n As in his Graundsires just defence, he falles in hand with Prete \n Who like no brother but a foe did late before defeate \n King Acrise of his townes by warre and of his royall seate. \n But neyther could his men of warre nor fortresse won by wrong \n Defend him from the griesly looke of grim Medusa long. \n And yet thee, foolish Polydect of little Seriph King, \n Such rooted rancor inwardly continually did sting, \n That neyther Perseys prowesse tride in such a sort of broyles \n Nor yet the perils he endurde, nor all his troublous toyles \n Could cause thy stomacke to relent. Within thy stonie brest \n Workes such a kinde of festred hate as cannot be represt. \n Thy wrongfull malice hath none ende. Moreover thou of spite \n Repining at his worthy praise, his doings doste backbite: \n Upholding that Medusas death was but a forged lie: \n So long till Persey for to shewe the truth apparantly, \n Desiring such as were his friendes to turne away their eye, \n Drue out Medusas ougly head. At sight whereof anon \n The hatefull Tyran Polydect was turned to a stone.\n\n \n",
            "3":"\n\n The Goddesse Pallas all this while did keepe continually \n Hir brother Persey companie, till now that she did stie \n From Seriph in a hollow cloud, and leaving on the right \n The Iles of Scyre and Gyaros, she made from thence hir flight \n Directly over that same Sea as neare as eye could ame \n To Thebe and Mount Helicon , and when she thither came, \n She stayde hir selfe, and thus bespake the learned sisters nine: \n A rumor of an uncouth spring did pierce these eares of mine \n The which the winged stede shouldmake by stamping with his hoofe. \n This is the cause of my repaire: I would for certaine proofe \n Be glad to see the wondrous thing. For present there I stoode \n And saw the selfesame Pegasus spring of his mothers blood. \n Dame Uranie did entertaine and aunswere Pallas thus: \n What cause so ever moves your grace to come and visit us, \n Most heartely you welcome are: and certaine is the fame \n Of this our Spring, that Pegasus was causer of the same. \n And with that worde she led hir forth to see the sacred spring. \n Who musing greatly with hir selfe at straungenesse of the thing, \n Surveyde the Woodes and groves about of auncient stately port. \n And when she saw the Bowres to which the Muses did resort, \n And pleasant fields beclad with herbes of sundrie hew and sort, \n She said that for their studies sake they were in happie cace \n And also that to serve their turne they had so trim a place. \n Then one of them replied thus: O noble Ladie who \n (But that your vertue greater workes than these are calles you to) \n Should else have bene of this our troupe, your saying is full true. \n To this our trade of life and place is commendation due. \n And sure we have a luckie lot and if the world were such \n As that we might in safetie live, but lewdnesse reignes so much \n That all things make us Maides afraide. Me thinkes I yet do see \n The wicked Tyran Pyren still: my heart is yet scarce free \n From that same feare with which it hapt us flighted for to bee. \n This cruell Pyren was of Thrace and with his men of war \n The land of Phocis had subdude, and from this place not far \n Within the Citie Dawlis reignde by force of wrongfull hand, \n One day to Phebus Temples warde that on Parnasus stand \n As we were going, in our way he met us courteously, \n And by the name of Goddesses saluting reverently \n Said: O ye Dames of Meonie (for why he knew us well) \n I pray you stay and take my hou.e untill this storme (there fell \n That time a tempest and a showre) be past: the Gods aloft \n Have entred smaller sheddes than mine full many a time and oft. \n The rainie wether and hys wordes so moved us, that wee \n To go into an outer house of his did all agree. \n As soone as that the showre was past and heaven was voyded cleare \n Of all the Cloudes which late before did every where appeare, \n Until that Boreas had subdude the rainie Southerne winde, \n We woulde have by and by bene gone. He shet the doores in minde \n To ravish us: but we with wings escaped from his hands. \n He purposing to follow us, upon a Turret stands, \n And sayth he needes will after us the same way we did flie. \n And with that worde full frantickly he leapeth downe from hie, \n And pitching evelong on his face the bones asunder crasht, \n And dying, all abrode the ground his wicked bloud bedasht. \n Now as the Muse was telling this, they heard a noyse of wings \n And from the leavie boughes aloft a sound of greeting rings. \n Minerva looking up thereat demaunded whence the sounde \n Of tongues that so distinctly spake did come so plaine and rounde? \n She thought some woman or some man had greeted hir that stounde. \n It was a flight of Birdes. Nyne Pies bewailing their mischaunce \n In counterfetting everie thing from bough to bough did daunce. \n As Pallas wondred at the sight, the Muse spake thus in summe: \n These also being late ago in chalenge overcome, \n Made one kinde more of Birdes than was of auncient time beforne. \n In Macedone they were about the Citie Pella borne \n Of Pierus, a great riche Chuffe, and Euip, who by ayde \n Of strong Lucina travailing nine times, nine times was laide \n Of daughters in hir childbed safe. This fond and foolish rout \n Of doltish sisters taking pride and waxing verie stout, \n Bicause they were in number nine came flocking all togither \n Through all the townes of Thessalie and all Achaia hither, \n And us with these or such like wordes to combate did provoke. \n Cease off, ye Thespian Goddesses, to mocke the simple folke \n With fondnesse of your Melodie. And if ye thinke in deede \n Ye can doe ought, contend with us and see how you shall speede. \n I warrant you ye passe us not in cunning nor in voyce. \n Ye are here nine, and so are we. We put you to the choyce, \n That eyther we will vanquish you and set you quight beside \n Your fountaine made by Pegasus which is your chiefest pride, \n And Aganippe too: or else confounde you us, and we \n Of all the woods of Macedone will dispossessed be \n As farre as snowie Peonie: and let the Nymphes be Judges. \n Now in good sooth it was a shame to cope with suchie Drudges, \n But yet more shame it was to yeeld. The chosen Nymphes did sweare \n By Styx , and sate them downe on seates of stone that growed there. \n Then streight without commission or election of the rest, \n The formost of them preasing forth undecently, profest \n The chalenge to performe: and song the battels of the Goddes. \n She gave the Giants all the praise, the honor and the oddes, \n Abasing sore the worthie deedes of all the Gods. She telles \n How Typhon issuing from the earth and from the deepest helles, \n Made all the Gods above afraide, so greatly that they fled \n And never staide till Aegypt land and Nile whose streame is shed \n In channels seven, received them forwearied all togither: \n And how the Helhound Typhon did pursue them also thither. \n By meanes wherof the Gods eche one were faine themselves to hide \n In forged shapes. She saide that Jove the Prince of Gods was wride \n In shape of Ram: which is the cause that at this present tide \n Joves ymage which the Lybian folke by name of Hammon serve, \n Is made with crooked welked homes that inward still doe terve: \n That Phebus in a Raven lurkt, and Bacchus in a Geate, \n And Phebus sister in a Cat, and Juno in a Neate, \n And Venus in the shape of Fish, and how that last of all \n Mercurius hid him in a Bird which Ibis men doe call. \n This was the summe of all the tale which she with rolling tung \n And yelling throteboll to hir harpe before us rudely sung. \n Our turne is also come to speake, but that perchaunce your grace \n To give the hearing to our song hath now no time nor space. \n Yes yes (quoth Pallas) tell on forth in order all your tale: \n And downe she sate among the trees which gave a pleasant swale. \n The Muse made aunswere thus: To one Calliope here by name \n This chalenge we committed have and ordring of the same. \n Then rose up faire Calliope with goodly bush of heare \n Trim wreathed up with yvie leaves, and with hir thumbe gan steare \n The quivering strings, to trie them if they were in tune or no. \n Which done, she playde upon hir Lute and song hir Ditie so:\n\n \n",

He wrestleth oft and walloweth for to wit \n And if he can remove the weight of all that mightie land \n Or tumble downe the townes and hilles that on his bodie stand. \n By meanes whereof it commes to passe that oft the Earth doth shake: \n And even the King of Ghostes himselfe for verie feare doth quake, \n Misdoubting lest the Earth should clive so wide that light of day \n Might by the same pierce downe to Hell and there the Ghostes affray. \n Forecasting this, the Prince of Fiendes forsooke his darksome hole, \n And in a Chariot drawen with Steedes as blacke as any cole \n The whole foundation of the Ile of Sicill warely vewde. \n When throughly he had sercht eche place that harme had none ensewde, \n As carelessly he raungde abrode, he chaunced to be seene \n Of Venus sitting on hir hill: who taking streight betweene \n Hir armes hir winged Cupid, said: My sonne, mine only stay, \n My hand, mine honor and my might, go take without delay \n Those tooles which all wightes do subdue, and strike them in the hart \n Of that same God that of the world enjoyes the lowest part. \n The Gods of Heaven, and Jove himselfe, the powre of Sea and Land \n And he that rules the powres on Earth obey thy mightie hand: \n And wherefore then should only Hell still unsubdued stand? \n Thy mothers Empire and thine own why doste thou not advaunce? \n The third part of al the world now hangs in doubtful chaunce. \n And yet in heaven too now, their deedes thou seest me faine to beare. \n We are despisde: the strength of love with me away doth weare. \n Seeste not the Darter Diane and dame Pallas have already \n Exempted them from my behestes? and now of late so heady \n Is Ceres daughter too, that if we let hir have hir will, \n She will continue all hir life a Maid unwedded still. \n For that is all hir hope, and marke whereat she mindes to shoote. \n But thou (if ought this gracious turne our honor may promote, \n Or ought our Empire beautifie which joyntly we doe holde,) \n This Damsell to hir uncle joyne. No sooner had she tolde \n These wordes, but Cupid opening streight his quiver chose therefro \n One arrow (as his mother bade) among a thousand mo. \n But such a one it was, as none more sharper was than it, \n Nor none went streighter from the Bow the amed marke to hit. \n He set his knee against his Bow and bent it out of hande, \n And made his forked arrowes steale in Plutos heart to stande. \n Neare Enna walles there standes a Lake: Pergusa is the name. \n Cayster heareth not mo songs of Swannes than doth the same. \n A wood environs everie side the water round about, \n And with his leaves as with a veyle doth keepe the Sunne heate out. \n The boughes doe yeelde a coole fresh Ayre: the moystnesse of the grounde \n Yeeldes sundrie flowres: continuall spring is all the yeare there founde. \n While in this garden Proserpine was taking hir pastime, \n In gathering eyther Violets blew, or Lillies white as Lime, \n And while of Maidenly desire she fillde hir Maund and Lap, \n Endevoring to outgather hir companions there, by hap \n Dis spide hir: lovde hir: caught hir up: and all at once well nere, \n So hastie, hote, and swift a thing is Love as may appeare. \n The Ladie with a wailing voyce afright did often call \n Hir Mother and hir waiting Maides, but Mother most of all. \n And as she from the upper part hir garment would have rent, \n By chaunce she let hir lap slip downe, and out hir flowres went. \n And such a sillie simplenesse hir childish age yet beares, \n That even the verie losse of them did move hir more to teares. \n The Catcher drives his Chariot forth, and calling every horse \n By name, to make away apace he doth them still enforce: \n And shakes about their neckes and Manes their rustie bridle reynes \n And through the deepest of the Lake perforce he them constreynes. \n And through the Palik pooles, the which from broken ground doe boyle \n And smell of Brimstone verie ranke: and also by the soyle \n Where as the Bacchies, folke of Corinth with the double Seas, \n Betweene unequall Havons twaine did reere a towne for ease. \n\n \n",
            "5":"\n\n Betweene the fountaines of Cyane and Arethuse of Pise \n An arme of Sea that meetes enclosde with narrow homes there lies. \n Of this the Poole callde Cyane which beareth greatest fame \n Among the Nymphes of Sicilie did algates take the name. \n Who vauncing hir unto the waste amid hir Poole did know \n Dame Proserpine, and said to Dis: Ye shall no further go: \n You cannot Ceres sonneinlawe be, will she so or no. \n You should have sought hir courteously and not enforst hir so. \n And if I may with great estates my simple things compare, \n Anapus was in love with me: but yet he did not fare \n As you doe now with Proserpine. He was content to woo \n And I unforst and unconstreind consented him untoo. \n This said, she spreaded forth hir armes and stopt him of his way. \n His hastie wrath Saturnus sonne no lenger then could stay. \n But chearing up his dreadfull Steedes did smight his royall mace \n With violence in the bottome of the Poole in that same place. \n The ground streight yeelded to his stroke and made him way to Hell, \n And downe the open gap both horse and Chariot headlong fell. \n Dame Cyan taking sore to heart as well the ravishment \n Of Proserpine against hir will, as also the contempt \n Against hir fountaines priviledge, did shrowde in secret hart \n An inward corsie comfortlesse, which never did depart \n Untill she melting into teares consumde away with smart. \n The selfesame waters of the which she was but late ago \n The mighty Goddesse, now she pines and wastes hirselfe into. \n Ye might have seene hir limmes wex lithe, ye might have bent hir bones. \n Hir nayles wext soft: and first of all did melt the smallest ones: \n As haire and fingars, legges and feete: for these same slender parts \n Doe quickly into water turne, and afterward converts \n To water, shoulder, backe, brest, side: and finally in stead \n Of lively bloud, within hir veynes corrupted there was spred \n Thinne water: so that nothing now remained whereupon \n Ye might take holde, to water all consumed was anon. \n The carefull mother in the while did seeke hir daughter deare \n Through all the world both Sea and Land, and yet was nere the neare. \n The Morning with hir deawy haire hir slugging never found, \n Nor yet the Evening star that brings the night upon the ground. \n Two seasoned Pynetrees at the mount of Aetna did she light \n And bare them restlesse in hir handes through all the dankish night. \n Againe as soone as chierfull day did dim the starres, she sought \n Hir daughter still from East to West. And being overwrought \n She caught a thirst: no liquor yet had come within hir throte. \n By chaunce she spied nere at hand a pelting thatched Cote \n Wyth peevish doores: she knockt thereat, and out there commes a trot. \n The Goddesse asked hir some drinke and she denide it not: \n But out she brought hir by and by a draught of merrie go downe \n And therewithall a Hotchpotch made of steeped Barlie browne \n And Flaxe and Coriander seede and other simples more \n The which she in an Earthen pot together sod before. \n While Ceres was a eating this, before hir gazing stood \n A hard faaste boy, a shrewde pert wag, that could no maners good: \n He laughed at hir and in scorne did call hir greedie gut. \n The Goddesse being wroth therewith, did on the Hotchpotch put \n The liquor ere that all was eate, and in his face it threw. \n Immediatly the skinne thereof became of speckled hew, \n And into legs his armes did turne: and in his altred hide \n A wrigling tayle streight to his limmes was added more beside. \n And to th'intent he should not have much powre to worken scathe, \n His bodie in a little roume togither knit she hathe. \n For as with pretie Lucerts he in facion doth agree: \n So than the Lucert somewhat lesse in every poynt is he. \n The poore old woman was amazde: and bitterly she wept: \n She durst not touche the uncouth worme, who into corners crept. \n And of the flecked spottes like starres that on his hide are set \n A name agreeing thereunto in Latine doth he get. \n It is our Swift whose skinne with gray and yellow specks is fret. \n What Lands and Seas the Goddesse sought it were too long to saine. \n The worlde did want. And so she went to Sicill backe againe. \n And as in going every where she serched busily, \n She also came to Cyane: who would assuredly \n Have tolde hir all things, had she not transformed bene before. \n But mouth and tongue for uttrance now would serve hir turne no more. \n Howbeit a token manifest she gave hir for to know \n What was become of Proserpine. Her girdle she did show \n Still hovering on hir holie poole, which slightly from hir fell \n As she that way did passe: and that hir mother knew too well. \n For when she saw it, by and by as though she had but than \n Bene new advertisde of hir chaunce, she piteously began \n To rend hir ruffled haire, and beate hir handes against hir brest. \n As yet she knew not where she was. But yet with rage opprest, \n She curst all landes, and said they were unthankfull everychone, \n Yea and unworthy of the fruites bestowed them upon. \n But bitterly above the rest she banned Sicilie, \n In which the mention of hir losse she plainely did espie. \n And therefore there with cruell hand the earing ploughes she brake, \n And man and beast that tilde the grounde to death in anger strake. \n She marrde the seede, and eke forbade the fieldes to yeelde their frute. \n The plenteousnesse of that same lie of which there went suche bruit \n Through all the world, lay dead: the come was killed in the blade: \n Now too much drought, now too much wet did make it for to fade. \n The starres and blasting windes did hurt, the hungry foules did eate \n The come in ground: the Tines and Briars did overgow the Wheate. \n And other wicked weedes the corne continually annoy, \n Which neyther tylth nor toyle of man was able to destroy.\n\n \n",

Unwillingly, God wote, \n She opened to the Ravisher that violently hir smote. \n It is not sure my native soyle for which I thus entreate. \n I am but here a sojourner, my native soyle and seate \n Is Pisa and from Ely towne I fetch my first discent. \n I dwell but as a straunger here: but sure to my intent \n This Countrie likes me better farre than any other land. \n Here now I Arethusa dwell: here am I setled: and \n I humbly you beseche extend your favour to the same. \n A time will one day come when you to mirth may better frame, \n And have your heart more free from care, which better serve me may \n To tell you why I from my place so great a space doe stray, \n And unto Ortygie am brought through so great Seas and waves. \n The ground doth give me passage free, and by the lowest caves \n Of all the Earth I make my way, and here I raise my heade, \n And looke upon the starres agayne neare out of knowledge fled. \n Now while I underneath the Earth the Lake of Styx did passe, \n I saw your daughter Proserpine with these same eyes. She was \n Not merrie, neyther rid of feare as seemed by hir cheere. \n But yet a Queene, but yet of great God Dis the stately Feere: \n But yet of that same droupie Realme the chiefe and sovereigne Peere. \n Hir mother stoode as starke as stone, when she these newes did heare, \n And long she was like one that in another worlde had beene. \n But when hir great amazednesse by greatnesse of hir teene \n Was put aside, she gettes hir to hir Chariot by and by \n And up to heaven in all post haste immediately doth stie. \n And there beslowbred all hir face: hir haire about hir eares, \n To royall Jove in way of plaint this spightfull tale she beares: \n As well for thy bloud as for mine a suter unto thee \n I hither come. If no regard may of the mother bee \n Yet let the childe hir father move, and have not lesser care \n Of hir (I pray) bicause that I hir in my bodie bare. \n Behold our daughter whome I sought so long is found at last: \n If finding you it terme, when of recoverie meanes is past. \n Or if you finding do it call to have a knowledge where \n She is become. Hir ravishment we might consent to beare, \n So restitution might be made. And though there were to me \n No interest in hir at all, yet forasmuche as she \n Is yours, it is unmeete she be bestowde upon a theefe. \n Jove aunswerde thus: My daughter is a Jewell deare and leefe: \n A collup of mine owne flesh cut as well as out of thine. \n But if we in our heartes can finde things rightly to define, \n This is not spight but love. And yet Madame in faith I see \n No cause of such a sonne in law ashamed for to bee, \n So you contented were therewith. For put the case that hee \n Were destitute of all things else, how greate a matter ist \n Joves brother for to be? but sure in him is nothing mist. \n Nor he inferior is to me save only that by lot \n The Heavens to me, the Helles to him the destnies did allot. \n But if you have so sore desire your daughter to divorce, \n Though she againe to Heaven repayre I doe not greatly force. \n But yet conditionly that she have tasted there no foode: \n For so the destnies have decreed.

For as she hapt one day \n In Plutos Ortyard rechlessely from place to place to stray, \n She gathering from a bowing tree a ripe Pownegarnet, tooke \n Seven kernels out and sucked them. None chaunst hereon to looke, \n Save onely one Ascalaphus whome Orphne, erst a Dame \n Among the other Elves of Hell not of the basest fame, \n Bare to hir husbande Acheron within hir duskie den. \n He sawe it, and by blabbing it ungraciously as then, \n Did let hir from returning thence. A grievous sigh the Queene \n Of Hell did fetch, and of that wight that had a witnesse beene \n Against hir made a cursed Birde. Upon his face she shead \n The water of the Phlegeton: and by and by his head \n Was nothing else but Beake and Downe, and mightie glaring eyes. \n Quight altred from himselfe betweene two yellow wings he flies. \n He groweth chiefly into head and hooked talants long \n And much adoe he hath to flaske his lazie wings among. \n The messenger of Morning was he made, a filthie fowle, \n A signe of mischiefe unto men, the sluggish skreching Owle. \n This person for his lavish tongue and telling tales might seeme \n To have deserved punishment. But what should men esteeme \n To be the verie cause why you, Acheloes daughters, weare \n Both feete and feathers like to Birdes, considering that you beare \n The upper partes of Maidens still? And commes it so to passe \n Bicause when Ladie Proserpine a gathering flowers was, \n Ye Meremaides kept hir companie? Whome after you had sought \n Through all the Earth in vaine, anon of purpose that your thought \n Might also to the Seas be knowen, ye wished that ye might \n Upon the waves with hovering wings at pleasure rule your flight, \n And had the Goddes to your request so pliant, that ye found \n With yellow feathers out of hand your bodies clothed round: \n Yet lest that pleasant tune of yours ordeyned to delight \n The hearing, and so high a gift of Musicke perish might \n For want of uttrance, humaine voyce to utter things at will \n And countnance of virginitie remained to you still. \n But meane betweene his brother and his heavie sister goth \n God Jove, and parteth equally the yeare betweene them both. \n And now the Goddesse Proserpine indifferently doth reigne \n Above and underneath the Earth, and so doth she remaine \n One halfe yeare with hir mother and the resdue with hir Feere. \n Immediatly she altred is as well in outwarde cheere \n As inwarde minde. For where hir looke might late before appeere \n Sad even to Dis, hir countnance now is full of mirth and grace \n Even like as Phebus having put the watrie cloudes to chace, \n Doth shew himselfe a Conqueror with bright and shining face.\n\n \n",

I beare it well in minde that on a time \n In comming wearie from the chase of Stymphalus, the heate \n Was fervent, and my traveling had made it twice as great. \n I founde a water neyther deepe nor shallow which did glide \n Without all noyse, so calme that scarce the moving might be spide. \n And throughly to the very ground it was so crispe and cleare, \n That every little stone therein did plaine aloft appeare. \n The horie Sallowes and the Poplars growing on the brim \n Unset, upon the shoring bankes did cast a shadow trim. \n I entred in, and first of all I deeped but my feete: \n And after to my knees. And not content to wade so fleete, \n I put off all my clothes, and hung them on a Sallow by \n And threw my selfe amid the streame, which as I dallyingly \n Did beate and draw, and with my selfe a thousand maistries trie, \n In casting of mine armes abrode and swimming wantonly: \n I felt a bubling in the streame I wist not how nor what, \n And on the Rivers nearest brim I stept for feare. With that, \n O Arethusa, whither runst? and whither runst thou, cride \n Floud Alphey from his waves againe with hollow voyce. I hide \n Away unclothed as I was. For on the further side \n My clothes hung still. So much more hote and eger then was he, \n And for I naked was, I seemde the readier for to be. \n My running and his fierce pursuite was like as when ye se \n The sillie Doves with quivering wings before the Gossehauke stie, \n The Gossehauke sweeping after them as fast as he can flie. \n To Orchomen, and Psophy land, and Cyllen I did holde \n Out well, and thence to Menalus and Erymanth the colde, \n And so to Ely. All this way no ground of me he wonne. \n But being not so strong as he, this restlesse race to runne \n I could not long endure, and he could hold it out at length. \n Yet over plaines and wooddie hilles (as long as lasted strength) \n And stones, and rockes, and desert groundes I still maintaind my race. \n The Sunne was full upon my backe. I saw before my face \n A lazie shadow: were it not that feare did make me see't. \n But certenly he feared me with trampling of his feete: \n And of his mouth the boystous breath upon my hairlace blew. \n Forwearied with the toyle of flight: Helpe, Diane, I thy true \n And trustie Squire (I said) who oft have caried after thee \n Thy bow and arrowes, now am like attached for to bee. \n The Goddesse moved, tooke a cloude of such as scattred were \n And cast upon me. Hidden thus in mistie darkenesse there \n The River poard upon me still and hunted round about \n The hollow cloude, for feare perchaunce I should have scaped out. \n And twice not knowing what to doe he stalkt about the cloude \n Where Diane had me hid, and twice he called out aloude: \n Hoe Arethuse , hoe Arethuse . What heart had I poore wretch then? \n Even such as hath the sillie Lambe that dares not stirre nor quetch when \n He heares the howling of the Wolfe about or neare the foldes, \n Or such as hath the squatted Hare that in hir foorme beholdes \n The hunting houndes on every side, and dares not move a whit, \n He would not thence, for why he saw no footing out as yit. \n And therefore watcht he narrowly the cloud and eke the place. \n A chill colde sweat my sieged limmes opprest, and downe apace \n From all my bodie steaming drops did fall of watrie hew. \n Which way so ere I stird my foote the place was like a stew. \n The deaw ran trickling from my haire. In halfe the while I then \n Was turnde to water, that I now have tolde the tale agen. \n His loved waters Alphey knew, and putting off the shape \n Of man the which he tooke before bicause I should not scape, \n Returned to his proper shape of water by and by \n Of purpose for to joyne with me and have my companie. \n But Delia brake the ground, at which I sinking into blinde \n Bycorners, up againe my selfe at Ortigie doe winde, \n Right deare to me bicause it doth Dianas surname beare, \n And for bicause to light againe I first was raysed there. \n Thus far did Arethusa speake: and then the fruitfull Dame \n Two Dragons to hir Chariot put, and reyning hard the same, \n Midway beweene the Heaven and Earth she in the Ayer went, \n And unto Prince Triptolemus hir lightsome Chariot sent \n To Pallas Citie lode with come, commaunding him to sowe \n Some part in ground new broken up, and some thereof to strow \n In ground long tillde before. Anon the yong man up did stie \n And flying over Europe and the Realme of Asias hie, \n Alighted in the Scithian land. There reyned in that coast \n A King callde Lyncus, to whose house he entred for to host. \n And being there demaunded how and why he thither came, \n And also of his native soyle and of his proper name, \n I hight (quoth he) Triptolemus and borne was in the towne \n Of Athens in the land of Greece , that place of high renowne. \n I neyther came by Sea nor Lande, but through the open Aire \n I bring with me Dame Ceres giftes which being sowne in faire \n And fertile fields may fruitfull Harvests yeelde and finer fare. \n The savage King had spight, and to th'intent that of so rare \n And gracious gifts himselfe might seeme first founder for to be, \n He entertainde him in his house, and when asleepe was he, \n He came upon him with a sword: but as he would have killde him, \n Dame Ceres turnde him to a Lynx, and waking tother willde him \n His sacred Teemeware through the Ayre to drive abrode agen. \n The chiefe of us had ended this hir learned song, and then \n The Nymphes with one consent did judge that we the Goddesses \n Of Helicon had wonne the day. But when I sawe that these \n Unnurtred Damsels overcome began to fall a scolding, \n I sayd: so little sith to us you thinke your selves beholding, \n For bearing with your malapertnesse in making chalenge, that \n Besides your former fault, ye eke doe fall to rayling flat, \n Abusing thus our gentlenesse: we will from hence proceede \n The punishment, and of our wrath the rightfull humor feede. \n Euippyes daughters grinnd and jeerde and set our threatnings light. \n But as they were about to prate, and bent their fistes to smight \n Theyr wicked handes with hideous noyse, they saw the stumps of quilles \n New budding at their nayles, and how their armes soft feather hilles. \n Eche saw how others mouth did purse and harden into Bill, \n And so becomming uncouth Birdes to haunt the woods at will. \n For as they would have clapt their handes their wings did up them heave, \n And hanging in the Ayre the scoldes of woods did Pies them leave. \n Now also being turnde to Birdes they are as eloquent \n As ere they were, as chattring still, as much to babling bent. \n"

            "0":"\n Tritonia unto all these wordes attentive hearing bendes, \n And both the Muses learned song and rightfull wrath commendes. \n And thereupon within hir selfe this fancie did arise: \n It is no matter for to prayse: but let our selfe devise \n Some thing to be commended for: and let us not permit \n Our Majestie to be despisde without revenging it. \n And therewithall she purposed to put the Lydian Maide \n Arachne to hir neckeverse who (as had to hir bene saide) \n Presumed to prefer hir selfe before hir noble grace \n In making cloth. This Damsell was not famous for the place \n In which she dwelt, nor for hir stocke, but for hir Arte. Hir Sier \n Was Idmon, one of Colophon , a pelting Purple Dier. \n Hir mother was deceast: but she was of the baser sort, \n And egall to hir Make in birth, in living, and in port. \n But though this Maide were meanly borne, and dwelt but in a shed \n At little Hypep: yet hir trade hir fame abrode did spred \n Even all the Lydian Cities through. To see hir wondrous worke \n The Nymphes that underneath the Vines of shadie Tmolus lurke \n Their Vineyards oftentimes forsooke. So did the Nymphes also \n About Pactolus oftentimes their golden streames forgo. \n And evermore it did them good not only for to see \n Hir clothes already made, but while they eke a making bee \n Such grace was in hir workmanship. For were it so that shee \n The newshorne fleeces from the sheepe in bundels deftly makes, \n Or afterward doth kemb the same, and drawes it out in flakes \n Along like cloudes, or on the Rocke doth spinne the handwarpe woofe, \n Or else embroydreth, certenly ye might perceive by proofe \n She was of Pallas bringing up, which thing she nathelesse \n Denyeth, and disdaining such a Mistresse to confesse, \n Let hir contend with me, she saide: and if she me amend \n I will refuse no punishment the which she shall extend. \n Minerva tooke an olde wives shape and made hir haire seeme gray, \n And with a staffe hir febled limmes pretended for to stay. \n Which done, she thus began to speake: Not all that age doth bring \n We ought to shonne. Experience doth of long continuance spring. \n Despise not mine admonishment. Seeke fame and chiefe report \n For making cloth, and Arras worke, among the mortall sort. \n But humbly give the Goddesse place: and pardon of hir crave \n For these thine unadvised wordes. I warrant thou shalt have \n Forgivenesse, if thou aske it hir. Arachne bent hir brewes \n And lowring on hir, left hir worke: and hardly she eschewes \n From flying in the Ladies face. Hir countnance did bewray \n Hir moodie minde: which bursting forth in words she thus did say: \n Thou commest like a doting foole: thy wit is spent with yeares: \n Thy life hath lasted over long as by thy talke appeares. \n And if thou any daughter have, or any daughtrinlawe, \n I would she heard these wordes of mine: I am not such a Daw, \n But that without thy teaching I can well ynough advise \n My selfe. And lest thou shouldest thinke thy words in any wise \n Availe, the selfesame minde I keepe with which I first begonne. \n Why commes she not hirselfe I say? this matche why doth she shonne? \n Then said the Goddesse: Here she is. And therewithall she cast \n Hir oldewives riveled shape away, and shewde hir selfe at last \n Minerva like. The Nymphes did streight adore hir Majestie. \n So did the yong newmaried wives that were of Migdonie. \n The Maiden only unabasht woulde nought at all relent. \n But yet she blusht and sodenly a ruddynesse besprent \n Hir cheekes which wanzd away againe, even like as doth the Skie \n Looke sanguine at the breake of day, and turneth by and by \n To white at rising of the Sunne. As hote as any fire \n She sticketh to hir tackling still. And through a fond desire \n Of glorie, to hir owne decay all headlong forth she runnes. \n For Pallas now no lenger warnes, ne now no lenger shunnes \n Ne seekes the chalenge to delay. Immediatly they came \n And tooke their places severally, and in a severall frame \n Eche streynde a web, the warpe whereof was fine. The web was tide \n Upon a Beame. Betweene the warpe a stay of reede did slide. \n The woofe on sharpened pinnes was put betwixt the warp, and wrought \n With fingars. And as oft as they had through the warpe it brought, \n They strake it with a Boxen combe. Both twayne of them made hast: \n And girding close for handsomnesse their garments to their wast \n Bestirde their cunning handes apace. Their earnestnesse was such \n As made them never thinke of paine. They weaved verie much \n Fine Purple that was dide in Tyre , and colours set so trim \n That eche in shadowing other seemde the very same with him. \n Even like as after showres of raine when Phebus broken beames \n Doe strike upon the Cloudes, appeares a compast bow of gleames \n Which bendeth over all the Heaven: wherein although there shine \n A thousand sundry colours, yet the shadowing is so fine, \n That looke men nere so wistly, yet beguileth it their eyes: \n So like and even the selfsame thing eche colour seemes to rise \n Whereas they meete, which further off doe differ more and more. \n Of glittring golde with silken threede was weaved there good store. \n And stories put in portrayture of things done long afore. \n Minerva painted Athens towne and Marsis rocke therein, \n And all the strife betweene hirselfe and Neptune, who should win \n The honor for to give the name to that same noble towne. \n In loftie thrones on eyther side of Jove were settled downe \n Six Peeres of Heaven with countnance grave and full of Majestie, \n And every of them by his face discerned well might be. \n The Image of the mightie Jove was Kinglike. She had made \n Neptunus standing striking with his long thre tyned blade \n Upon the ragged Rocke: and from the middle of the clift \n She portrayd issuing out a horse, which was the noble gift \n For which he chalengde to himselfe the naming of the towne. \n She picturde out hirselfe with shielde and Morion on hir crowne \n With Curet on hir brest, and Speare in hand with sharpened ende. \n She makes the Earth (the which hir Speare doth seeme to strike) to sende \n An Olyf tree with fruite thereon: and that the Gods thereat \n Did wonder: and with victorie she finisht up that plat. \n Yet to th'intent examples olde might make it to be knowne \n To hir that for desire of praise so stoutly helde hir owne, \n What guerdon she shoulde hope to have for hir attempt so madde, \n Foure like contentions in the foure last corners she did adde.\n\n \n",
            "1":"\n\n The Thracians Heme and Rodope the formost corner hadde: \n Who being sometime mortall folke usurpt to them the name \n Of Jove and Juno, and were turnde to mountaines for the same. \n A Pigmie womans piteous chaunce the second corner shewde, \n Whome Juno turned to a Crane (bicause she was so lewde \n As for to stand at strife with hir for beautie) charging hir \n Against hir native countriefolke continuall war to stir. \n The thirde had proude Antigone, who durst of pride contende \n In beautie with the wife of Jove: by whome she in the ende \n Was turned to a Storke. No whit availed hir the towne \n Of Troy , or that Laomedon hir father ware a crowne, \n But that she, clad in feathers white, hir lazie wings must flap. \n And with a bobbed Bill bewayle the cause of hir missehap. \n The last had chyldelesse Cinyras: who being turnde to stone, \n Was picturde prostrate on the grounde, and weeping all alone, \n And culling fast betweene his armes a Temples greeces fine \n To which his daughters bodies were transformde by wrath divine. \n The utmost borders had a wreath of Olyf round about, \n And this is all the worke the which Minerva portrayd out. \n For with the tree that she hirselfe had made but late afore \n She bounded in hir Arras cloth, and then did worke no more. \n The Lydian maiden in hir web did portray to the full \n How Europe was by royall Jove beguilde in shape of Bull. \n A swimming Bull, a swelling Sea, so lively had she wrought, \n That Bull and Sea in very deede ye might them well have thought. \n The Ladie seemed looking backe to landwarde and to crie \n Upon hir women, and to feare the water sprinkling hie, \n And shrinking up hir fearfull feete. She portrayd also there \n Asteriee struggling with an Erne which did away hir beare. \n And over Leda she had made a Swan his wings to splay. \n She added also how by Jove in shape of Satyr gaye \n The faire Antiope with a paire of children was besped: \n And how he tooke Amphitrios shape when in Alcmenas bed \n He gate the worthie Hercules: and how he also came \n To Danae like a shoure of golde, to Aegine like a flame, \n A sheepeherd to Mnemosyne, and like a Serpent sly \n To Proserpine. She also made Neptunus leaping by \n Upon a Maide of Aeolus race in likenesse of a Bull, \n And in the streame Enipeus shape begetting on a trull \n The Giants Othe and Ephialt, and in the shape of Ram \n Begetting one Theophane Bisalties ympe with Lam, \n And in a lustie Stalions shape she made him covering there \n Dame Ceres with the yellow lockes, and hir whose golden heare \n Was turnde to crawling Snakes: on whome he gate the winged horse. \n She made him in a Dolphins shape Melantho to enforce. \n Of all these things she missed not their proper shapes, nor yit \n The full and just resemblance of their places for to hit. \n In likenesse of a Countrie cloyne was Phebus picturde there, \n And how he now ware Gossehaukes wings, and now a Lions heare. \n And how he in a shepeherdes shape was practising a wile \n The daughter of one Macarie, dame Issa, to beguile. \n And how the faire Erygone by chaunce did suffer rape \n By Bacchus who deceyved hir in likenesse of a grape. \n And how that Saturne in the shape of Genet did beget \n The double Chiron. Round about the utmost Verdge was set \n A narrow Traile of pretie floures with leaves of Ivie fret. \n Not Pallas, no, nor spight it selfe could any quarrell picke \n To this hir worke: and that did touch Minerva to the quicke. \n Who thereupon did rende the cloth in pieces every whit, \n Bicause the lewdnesse of the Gods was biased so in it. \n And with an Arras weavers combe of Box she fiercely smit \n Arachne on the forehead full a dozen times and more. \n The Maide impacient in hir heart, did stomacke this so sore, \n That by and by she hung hirselfe. Howbeit as she hing, \n Dame Pallas pitying hir estate, did stay hir in the string \n From death, and said: Lewde Callet live: but hang thou still for mee. \n And lest hereafter from this curse that time may set thee free, \n I will that this same punishment enacted firmely bee, \n As well on thy posteritie for ever as on thee. \n And after when she should depart, with juice of Hecats flowre \n She sprinkled hir: and by and by the poyson had such powre, \n That with the touch thereof hir haire, hir eares, and nose did fade: \n And verie small it both hir heade and all hir bodie made. \n In steade of legs, to both hir sides sticke fingars long and fine: \n The rest is bellie. From the which she nerethelesse doth twine \n A slender threede, and practiseth in shape of Spider still \n The Spinners and the Websters crafts of which she erst had skill.\n\n \n",
            "2":"\n\n All Lydia did repine hereat, and of this deede the fame \n Through Phrygie ran, and through the world was talking of the same. \n Before hir mariage Niobe had knowen hir verie well, \n When yet a Maide in Meonie and Sipyle she did dwell. \n And yet Arachnes punishment at home before hir eyes, \n To use discreter kinde of talke it could hir not advise, \n Nor (as behoveth) to the Gods to yeelde in humble wise. \n For many things did make hir proud. But neyther did the towne \n The which hir husband builded had, nor houses of renowne \n Of which they both descended were, nor yet the puissance \n Of that great Realme wherein they reignde so much hir minde enhaunce \n (Although the liking of them all did greatly hir delight) \n As did the offspring of hir selfe. And certenly she might \n Have bene of mothers counted well most happie, had she not \n So thought hir selfe. For she whome sage Tyresias had begot, \n The Prophet Manto, through instinct of heavenly powre, did say \n These kinde of wordes in open strete: Ye Thebanes go your way \n Apace, and unto Laton and to Latons children pray, \n And offer godly Frankinsence, and wreath your haire with Bay. \n Latona by the mouth of me commaundes you so to do. \n The Thebane women by and by obeying thereunto, \n Deckt all their heades with Laurell leaves as Manto did require, \n And praying with devout intent threw incense in the fire. \n Beholde out commeth Niobe environde with a garde \n Of servaunts and a solemne traine that followed afterward. \n She was hirselfe in raiment made of costly cloth of golde \n Of Phrygia facion verie brave and gorgeous to beholde. \n And of hir selfe she was right faire and beautifull of face, \n But that hir wrathfull stomake then did somewhat staine hir grace. \n She moving with hir portly heade hir haire the which as then \n Did hang on both hir shoulders loose, did pawse a while, and when \n Wyth loftie looke hir stately eyes she rolled had about: \n What madnesse is it (quoth she) to prefer the heavenly rout \n Of whome ye doe but heare, to such as daily are in sight? \n Or why should Laton honored be with Altars? Never wight \n To my most sacred Majestie did offer incense. Yit \n My Father was that Tantalus whome only as most fit \n The Gods among them at their boordes admitted for to sit. \n A sister of the Pleyades is my mother. Finally \n My Graundsire on the mothers side is that same Atlas hie \n That on his shoulders beareth up the heavenly Axeltree. \n Againe my other Graundfather is Jove, and (as you see) \n He also is my Fathrinlawe, wherein I glorie may. \n The Realme of Phrygia here at hand doth unto me obay. \n In Cadmus pallace I thereof the Ladie doe remaine \n And joyntly with my husbande I as peerlesse Princesse reigne \n Both over this same towne whose walles my husbands harpe did frame, \n And also over all the folke and people in the same. \n In what soever corner of my house I cast mine eye, \n A worlde of riches and of goods I everywhere espie. \n Moreover for the beautie, shape, and favor growen in me, \n Right well I know I doe deserve a Goddesse for to be. \n Besides all this, seven sonnes I have and daughters seven likewise, \n By whome shall shortly sonneinlawes and daughtrinlawes arise. \n Judge you now if that I have cause of statelynesse or no. \n How dare ye then prefer to me Latona that same fro \n The Titan Ceus ympe, to whome then readie downe to lie \n The hugy Earth a little plot to childe on did denie? \n From Heaven, from Earth, and from the Sea your Goddesse banisht was, \n And as an outcast through the world from place to place did passe, \n Untill that Delos pitying hir, sayde Thou doste fleete on land \n And I on Sea, and thereupon did lende hir out of hand \n A place unstable. Of two twinnes there brought abed was she: \n And this is but the seventh part of the issue borne by me. \n Right happie am I. Who can this denie? and shall so still I \n Continue. Who doth doubt of that? Abundance hath and will \n Preserve me. I am greater than that frowarde fortune may \n Empeache me. For although she should pull many things away, \n Yet should she leave me many more. My state is out of feare. \n Of thys my huge and populous race surmise you that it were \n Possible some of them should misse: yet can I never be \n So spoyled that no mo than two shall tarie styll with me. \n Leave quickly thys lewde sacrifice, and put me off this Bay \n That on your heads is wreathed thus. They laide it streight away \n And left their holie rites undone, and closely as they may \n With secret whispring to themselves to Laton they dyd pray. \n How much from utter barrennesse the Goddesse was: so much \n Disdeind she more: and in the top of Cynthus framed such \n Complaint as this to both hir twinnes. Lo I your mother deare, \n Who in my bodie once you twaine with painefull travail beare, \n Loe I whose courage is so stout as for to yeelde to none \n Of all the other Goddesses except Joves wife alone, \n Am lately doubted whether I a Goddesse be or no. \n And if you helpe not, children mine, the case now standeth so \n That I the honor must from hence of Altars quight forgo. \n But this is not mine only griefe. Besides hir wicked fact \n Most railing words hath Niobe to my defacing rackt. \n She durst prefer hir Barnes to you. And as for me, she naamde \n Me barren in respect of hir, and was no whit ashaamde \n To shewe hir fathers wicked tongue which she by birth doth take. \n This said: Latona was about entreatance for to make. \n Cease off (quoth Phebus ) long complaint is nothing but delay \n Of punishment, and the selfesame wordes did Phebe also say.\n\n \n",
            "3":"\n\n And by and by they through the Ayre both gliding swiftly downe, \n On Cadmus pallace hid in cloudes did light in Thebe towne. \n A fielde was underneath the wall both levell, large and wide, \n Betrampled every day with horse that men therin did ride, \n Where store of Carres and Horses hoves the cloddes to dust had trode. \n A couple of Amphions sonnes on lustie coursers rode \n In this same place. Their horses faire Coperisons did weare \n Of scarlet: and their bridles brave with golde bedecked were. \n Of whome as Niobs eldest sonne Ismenos hapt to bring \n His horse about, and reynde him in to make him keepe the ring, \n He cride alas: and in his brest with that an arrow stacke \n And by and by hys dying hand did let the bridle slacke. \n And on the right side of the horse he slipped to the ground. \n The second brother Sipylus did chaunce to heare the sound \n Of Quivers clattring in the Ayre, and giving streight the reyne \n And spur togither to his horse, began to flie amayne: \n As doth the master of a ship: who when he sees a shoure \n Approching, by some mistie cloud that ginnes to gloume and loure \n Doth clap on all his sayles bicause no winde should scape him by \n Though nere so small. Howbeit as he turned for to flie, \n He was not able for to scape the Arrow which did stricke \n Him through the necke. The nocke thereof did shaking upward sticke, \n The head appeared at his throte. And as he forward gave \n Himselfe in flying: so to ground he groveling also drave, \n And toppled by the horses mane and feete amid his race, \n And with his warme newshedded bloud berayed all the place. \n But Phedimus, and Tantalus, the heir of the name \n Of Tantalus, his Graundfather, who customably came \n From other dailie exercise to wrestling, had begun \n To close, and eache at other now with brest to brest to run, \n When Phebus Arrow being sent with force from streyned string \n Did strike through both of them as they did fast togither cling. \n And so they sighed both at once, and both at once for paine \n Fell downe to ground, and both of them at once their eyes did streine \n To see their latest light, and both at once their ghostes did yeelde. \n Alphenor this mischaunce of theirs with heavie heart behelde, \n And scratcht and beate his wofull brest: and therewith flying out \n To take them up betweene his armes, was as he went about \n This worke of kindly pitie, killde. For Phebus with a Dart \n Of deadly dint did rive him through the Bulke and brake his hart. \n And when the steale was plucked out, a percell of his liver \n Did hang upon the hooked heade: and so he did deliver \n His life and bloud into the Ayre departing both togither. \n But Damasicthon (on whose heade came never scissor) felt \n Mo woundes than one. It was his chaunce to have a grievous pelt \n Upon the verie place at which the leg is first begun \n And where the hamstrings by the joynt with supple sinewes run \n And while to draw this arrow out he with his hand assaide, \n Another through his wezant went, and at the feathers staide. \n The bloud did drive out this againe, and spinning high did spout \n A great way off, and pierst the Ayre with sprinkling all about. \n The last of all Ilionie with streched handes, and speche \n Most humble (but in vaine) did say: O Gods I you beseche \n Of mercie all in generall. He wist not what he saide \n Ne how that unto all of them he ought not to have praide. \n The God that helde the Bow in hande was moved: but as then \n The Arrow was alredie gone so farre, that backe agen \n He could not call it. Neerthelesse the wound was verie small \n Of which he dide, for why his heart it did but lightly gall. \n The rumor of the mischiefe selfe, and mone of people, and \n The weeping of hir servants gave the mother t'understand \n The sodaine stroke of this mischaunce. She wondred verie much \n And stormed also that the Gods were able to doe such \n A deede, or durst attempt it, yea she thought it more than right \n That any of them over hir should have so mickle might. \n Amphion had fordone himselfe alreadie with a knife, \n And ended all his sorrowes quite togither with his life. \n Alas, alas how greatly doth this Niobe differ here \n From tother Niobe who alate disdaining any Pere \n Did from Latonas Altars drive hir folke, and through the towne \n With haultie looke and stately gate went pranking up and downe, \n Then spighted at among hir owne, but piteous now to those: \n That heretofore for hir deserts had bene hir greatest foes. \n She falleth on the corses colde, and taking no regard, \n Bestowde hir kysses on hir sonnes as whome she afterwarde \n Did know she never more shoulde kisse. From whome she lifting thoe \n Hir blew and broosed armes to heaven sayd: O thou cruell foe \n Latona , feede, yea feede thy selfe I say upon my woe \n And overgorge thy stomacke, yea and glut thy cruell hart \n With these my present painefull pangs of bitter griping smart. \n In corses seven I seven times deade am caried to my grave. \n Rejoyce thou foe and triumph now in that thou seemste to have \n The upper hande. What? upper hand? no no it is not so. \n As wretched as my case doth seeme, yet have I left me mo \n Than thou for all thy happinesse canst of thine owne account. \n Even after all these corses yet I still doe thee surmount. \n Upon the ende of these same wordes the twanging of the string \n In letting of the Arrow flie was clearly heard: which thing \n Made every one save Niobe afraide. Hir heart was so \n With sorrowe hardned, that she grew more bolde. Hir daughters tho \n Were standing all with mourning weede and hanging haire before \n Their brothers coffins. One of them in pulling from the sore \n An Arrow sticking in his heart, sanke downe upon hir brother \n With mouth to mouth, and so did yeelde hir fleeting ghost. Another \n In comforting the wretched case and sorrow of hir mother \n Upon the sodaine helde hir peace. She stricken was within \n With double wound: which caused hir hir talking for to blin \n And shut hir mouth: but first hir ghost was gone. One all in vaine \n Attempting for to scape by flight was in hir flying slaine. \n Another on hir sisters corse doth tumble downe starke dead. \n This quakes and trembles piteously, and she doth hide hir head. \n And when that sixe with sundrye woundes dispatched were and gone, \n At last as yet remained one: and for to save that one, \n Hir mother with hir bodie whole did cling about hir fast, \n And wrying hir did over hir hir garments wholy cast: \n And cried out: O leave me one: this little one yet save: \n Of many but this only one the least of all I crave. \n But while she prayd, for whome she prayd was kild. Then down she sate \n Bereft of all hir children quite, and drawing to hir fate, \n Among hir daughters and hir sonnes and husband newly dead. \n Hir cheekes waxt hard, the Ayre could stirre no haire upon hir head. \n The colour of hir face was dim and clearly voide of blood, \n And sadly under open lids hir eyes unmoved stood. \n In all hir bodie was no life. For even hir verie tung \n And palat of hir mouth was hard, and eche to other clung. \n Hir Pulses ceased for to beate, hir necke did cease to bow, \n Hir armes to stir, hir feete to go, all powre forwent as now. \n And into stone hir verie wombe and bowels also bind. \n But yet she wept: and being hoyst by force of whirling wind \n Was caried into Phrygie. There upon a mountaines top \n She weepeth still in stone. From stone the drerie teares do drop. \n\n \n",
            "4":"\n\n Then all both men and women fearde Latonas open ire I \n And far with greater sumptuousnesse and earnester desire \n Did worship the great majestie of this their Goddesse who \n Did beare at once both Phebus and his sister Phebe too. \n And through occasion of this chaunce, (as men are wont to do \n In cases like) the people fell to telling things of old \n Of whome a man among the rest this tale ensuing told. \n The auncient folke that in the fieldes of fruitfull Lycia dwelt \n Due penance also for their spight to this same Goddesse felt. \n The basenesse of the parties makes the thing it selfe obscure. \n Yet is the matter wonderfull. My selfe I you assure \n Did presently beholde the Pond, and saw the very place \n In which this wondrous thing was done. My father then in case, \n Not able for to travell well by reason of his age, \n To fetch home certaine Oxen thence made me to be his page, \n Appointing me a countryman of Lycia to my guide. \n With whome as I went plodding in the pasture groundes, I spide \n Amids a certaine Pond an olde square Aultar colourd blacke \n With cinder of the sacrifice that still upon it stacke. \n About it round grew wavering Reedes. My guide anon did stay: \n And softly, O be good to me, he in himselfe did say. \n And I with like soft whispering did say, Be good to mee. \n And then I askt him whether that the Altar wee did see \n Belonged to the Waternymphes, or Faunes or other God \n Peculiar to the place it selfe upon the which we yod. \n He made me aunswere thus: My guest, no God of countrie race \n Is in this Altar worshipped. That Goddesse claymes this place, \n From whome the wife of mightie Jove did all the world forfend: \n When wandring restlesse here and there full hardly in the end \n Unsetled Delos did receyve then floting on the wave, \n As tide and weather to and fro the swimming Iland drave. \n There maugre Juno (who with might and main against hir strave) \n Latona staying by a Date and Olyf tree that sted \n In travail, of a paire of twinnes was safely brought abed. \n And after hir delivrance folke report that she for feare \n Of Junos wrath did flie from hence, and in hir armes did beare \n Hir babes which afterwarde became two Gods. In which hir travell \n In Sommer when the scorching Sunne is wont to burne the gravell \n Of Lycie countrie where the fell Chymera hath his place, \n The Goddesse wearie with the long continuance of hir race, \n Waxt thirstie by the meanes of drought with going in the Sunne . \n Hir babes had also suckt hir brestes as long as milke wold runne. \n By chaunce she spide this little Pond of water here bylow. \n And countrie Carles were gathering there these Osier twigs that grow \n So thicke upon a shrubbie stalke: and of these rushes greene: \n And flags that in these moorish plots so rife of growing beene. \n She comming hither kneeled downe the water up to take \n To coole hir thirst. The churlish cloynes forfended hir the Lake. \n Then gently said the Goddesse: Sirs, why doe you me forfend \n The water? Nature doth to all in common water send. \n For neither Sunne , nor Ayre, nor yet the Water private bee, \n I seeke but that which natures gift hath made to all things free. \n And yet I humbly crave of you to graunt it unto mee. \n I did not go about to wash my werie limmes and skin, \n I would but only quench my thirst. My throte is scalt within \n For want of moysture: and my chappes and lippes are parching drie: \n And scarsly is there way for wordes to issue out thereby. \n A draught of water will to me be heavenly Nectar now. \n And sure I will confesse I have received life of you. \n Yea in your giving of a drop of water unto mee, \n The case so standeth as you shall preserve the lives of three. \n Alas let these same sillie soules that in my bosome stretch \n Their little armes (by chaunce hir babes their pretie dolles did retch) \n To pitie move you. What is he so hard that would not yeeld \n To this the gentle Goddesses entreatance meeke and meeld? \n Yet they for all the humble wordes she could devise to say, \n Continued in their willfull moode of churlish saying nay, \n And threatned for to sende hir thence onlesse she went away, \n Reviling hir most spightfully. And not contented so, \n With handes and feete the standing Poole they troubled to and fro, \n Until with trampling up and downe maliciously, the soft \n And slimie mud that lay beneath was raised up aloft. \n With that the Goddesse was so wroth that thirst was quight forgot. \n And unto such unworthie Carles hirselfe she humbleth not: \n Ne speaketh meaner wordes than might beseeme a Goddesse well. \n But holding up hir handes to heaven: For ever mought you dwell \n In this same Pond, she said: hir wish did take effect with speede. \n For underneath the water they delight to be in deede. \n Now dive they to the bottome downe, now up their heades they pop, \n Another while with sprawling legs they swim upon the top. \n And oftentimes upon the bankes they have a minde to stond, \n And oftentimes from thence againe to leape into the Pond. \n And there they now doe practise still their filthy tongues to scold \n And shamelessely (though underneath the water) they doe hold \n Their former wont of brawling still amid the water cold. \n Their voices stil are hoarse and harsh, their throtes have puffed goles, \n Their chappes with brawling widened are, their hammer headed Jowls \n Are joyned to their shoulders just, the neckes of them doe seeme \n Cut off, the ridgebone of their backe stickes up of colour greene. \n Their paunch which is the greatest part of all their trunck is gray, \n And so they up and downe the Pond made newly Frogges doe play.\n\n \n",
            "5":"\n\n When one of Lyce (I wote not who) had spoken in this sort, \n Another of a Satyr streight began to make report, \n Whome Phebus overcomming on a pipe (made late ago \n By Pallas) put to punishment. Why flayest thou me so, \n Alas, he cride, it irketh me. Alas a sorie pipe \n Deserveth not so cruelly my skin from me to stripe. \n For all his crying ore his eares quight pulled was his skin. \n Nought else he was than one whole wounde. The griesly bloud did spin \n From every part, the sinewes lay discovered to the eye, \n The quivering veynes without a skin lay beating nakedly. \n The panting bowels in his bulke ye might have numbred well, \n And in his brest the shere small strings a man might easly tell. \n The Countrie Faunes, the Gods of Woods, the Satyrs of his kin, \n The Mount Olympus whose renowne did ere that time begin, \n And all the Nymphes, and all that in those mountaines kept their sheepe, \n Or grazed cattell thereabouts, did for this Satyr weepe. \n The fruitfull earth waxt moyst therewith, and moysted did receyve \n Their teares, and in hir bowels deepe did of the same conceyve. \n And when that she had turned them to water, by and by \n She sent them forth againe aloft to see the open Skie. \n The River that doth rise thereof beginning there his race, \n In verie deepe and shoring bankes to Seaward runnes apace \n Through Phrygie, and according as the Satyr, so the streame \n Is called Marsias, of the brookes the clearest in that Realme. \n With such examples as these same the common folke returnde \n To present things, and every man through all the Citie moornde \n For that Amphion was destroyde with all his issue so. \n But all the fault and blame was laide upon the mother tho. \n For hir alonly Pelops mournde (as men report) and hee \n In opening of his clothes did shewe that everie man might see \n His shoulder on the left side bare of Ivorie for to bee. \n This shoulder at his birth was like his tother both in hue \n And flesh, untill his fathers handes most wickedly him slue, \n And that the Gods when they his limmes againe togither drue, \n To joyne them in their proper place and forme by nature due, \n Did finde out all the other partes, save only that which grue \n Betwene the throteboll and the arme, which when they could not get \n This other made of Ivorie white in place therof they set \n And by that meanes was Pelops made againe both whole and sound.\n\n \n",
            "6":"\n\n The neyghbor Princes thither came, and all the Cities round \n About besought their Kings to go and comfort Thebe: as Arge \n And Sparta , and Mycene which was under Pelops charge, \n And Calydon unhated of the frowning Phebe yit, \n The welthie towne Orchomenos , and Corinth which in it \n Had famous men for workmanship in mettals: and the stout \n Messene which full twentie yeares did hold besiegers out. \n And Patre, and the lowly towne Cleona, Nelies Pyle, \n And Troyzen not surnamed yet Pittheia for a while. \n And all the other Borough townes and Cities which doe stand \n Within the narrow balke at which two Seas doe meete at hand, \n Or which do bound upon the balke without in maine firme land. \n Alonly Athens (who would thinke?) did neither come nor send. \n Warre barred them from courtesie the which they did entend. \n The King of Pontus with an host of savage people lay \n In siege before their famous waHes and curstly did them fray. \n Untill that Tereus, King of Thrace , approching to their ayde, \n Did vanquish him, and with renowne was for his labor payde. \n And sith he was so puissant in men and ready coyne, \n And came of mightie Marsis race, Pandion sought to joyne \n Aliance with him by and by, and gave him to his Feere \n His daughter Progne. At this match (as after will appeare) \n Was neyther Juno, President of mariage wont to bee, \n Nor Hymen, no nor any one of all the graces three. \n The Furies snatching Tapers up that on some Herce did stande \n Did light them, and before the Bride did beare them in their hande. \n The Furies made the Bridegroomes bed. And on the house did rucke \n A cursed Owle the messenger of yll successe and lucke. \n And all the night time while that they were lying in their beds, \n She sate upon the bedsteds top right over both their heds. \n Such handsell Progne had the day that Tereus did hir wed. \n Such handsell had they when that she was brought of childe abed. \n All Thracia did rejoyce at them, and thankt their Gods, and willd \n That both the day of Prognes match with Tereus should be hild \n For feastfull, and the day likewise that Itys first was borne: \n So little know we what behoves. The Sunne had now outworne \n Five Harvests, and by course five times had run his yearly race, \n When Progne flattring Tereus saide: If any love or grace \n Betweene us be, send eyther me my sister for to see, \n Or finde the meanes that hither she may come to visit mee. \n You may assure your Fathrinlaw she shall againe returne \n Within a while. Ye doe to me the highest great good turne \n That can be, if you bring to passe I may my sister see. \n Immediatly the King commaundes his shippes aflote to bee. \n And shortly after, what with sayle and what with force of Ores, \n In Athens haven he arrives and landes at Pyrey shores. \n As soone as of his fathrinlaw the presence he obtainde, \n And had of him bene courteously and friendly entertainde, \n Unhappie handsell entred with their talking first togither. \n The errandes of his wife, the cause of his then comming thither, \n He had but new begon to tell, and promised that when \n She had hir sister seene, she should with speede be sent agen: \n When (see the chaunce) came Philomele in raiment very rich, \n And yet in beautie farre more rich, even like the Fairies which \n Reported are the pleasant woods and water springs to haunt, \n So that the like apparell and attire to them you graunt. \n King Tereus at the sight of hir did burne in his desire, \n As if a man should chaunce to set a gulfe of come on fire, \n Or burne a stacke of hay. Hir face in deede deserved love. \n But as for him, to fleshly lust even nature did him move. \n For of those countries commonly the people are above \n All measure prone to lecherie. And therefore both by kinde \n His flame encreast, and by his owne default of vicious minde. \n He purposde fully to corrupt hir servants with reward: \n Or for to bribe hir Nurce, that she should slenderly regarde \n Hir dutie to hir mistresseward. And rather than to fayle, \n The Ladie even hirselfe with gifts he minded to assayle, \n And all his kingdome for to spend, or else by force of hand \n To take hir, and in maintenance thereof by sword to stand. \n There was not under heaven the thing but that he durst it prove, \n So far unable was he now to stay his lawlesse love. \n Delay was deadly. Backe againe with greedie minde he came \n Of Prognes errands for to talke: and underneath the same \n He workes his owne ungraciousnesse. Love gave him power to frame \n His talke at will. As oft as he demaunded out of square, \n Upon his wives importunate desire himselfe he bare. \n He also wept: as though his wife had willed that likewise. \n O God, what blindnesse doth the heartes of mortall men disguise? \n By working mischiefe Tereus gets him credit for to seeme \n A loving man, and winneth praise by wickednesse extreeme. \n Yea and the foolish Philomele the selfesame thing desires. \n Who hanging on hir fathers necke with flattring armes, requires \n Against hir life and for hir life his licence for to go \n To see hir sister. Tereus beholdes hir wistly tho, \n And in beholding handles hir with heart. For when he saw \n Hir kisse hir father, and about his necke hir armes to draw, \n They all were spurres to pricke him forth, and wood to feede his fire, \n And foode of forcing nourishment to further his desire. \n As oft as she hir father did betweene hir armes embrace, \n So often wished he himselfe hir father in that case. \n For nought at all should that in him have wrought the greater grace. \n Hir father could not say them nay, they lay at him so sore. \n Right glad thereof was Philomele and thanked him therefore. \n And wretched wench she thinkes she had obtained such a thing, \n As both to Progne and hir selfe should joy and comfort bring, \n When both of them in verie deede should afterward it rew. \n To endward of his daily race and travell Phebus drew, \n And on the shoring side of Heaven his horses downeward flew. \n A princely supper was prepaarde, and wine in golde was set: \n And after meate to take their rest the Princes did them get. \n But though the King of Thrace that while were absent from hir sight, \n Yet swelted he: and in his minde revolving all the night \n Hir face, hir gesture, and hir hands, imaginde all the rest \n (The which as yet he had not seene) as likte his fancie best. \n He feedes his flames himselfe. No winke could come within his eyes, \n For thinking ay on hir. As soone as day was in the skies, \n Pandion holding in his hand the hand of Tereus prest \n To go his way, and sheading teares betooke him thus his guest: \n Deare sonneinlaw I give thee here (sith godly cause constraines) \n This Damsell. By the faith that in thy Princely heart remaines, \n And for our late aliance sake, and by the Gods above, \n I humbly thee beseche that as a Father thou doe love \n And maintaine hir, and that as soone as may be (all delay \n Will unto me seeme over long) thou let hir come away, \n The comfort of my carefull age on whome my life doth stay. \n And thou my daughter Philomele (it is inough ywis \n That from hir father set so farre thy sister Progne is) \n If any sparke of nature doe within thy heart remayne, \n With all the haaste and speede thou canst returne to me againe.\n\n \n",
            "7":"\n\n In giving charge he kissed hir: and downe his cheekes did raine \n The tender teares, and as a pledge of faith he tooke the right \n Handes of them both, and joyning them did eche to other plight, \n Desiring them to beare in minde his commendations to \n His daughter and hir little sonne. And then with much adoe \n For sobbing, at the last he bad adew as one dismaid. \n The foremisgiving of his minde did make him sore afraid. \n As soone as Tereus and the Maide togither were aboord, \n And that their ship from land with Ores was haled on the foord, \n The fielde is ours, he cride aloude, I have the thing I sought \n And up he skipt, so barbrous and so beastly was his thought, \n That scarce even there he could forbeare his pleasure to have wrought. \n His eye went never off of hir: as when the scarefull Erne \n With hooked talants trussing up a Hare among the Ferne, \n Hath laid hir in his nest, from whence the prisoner can not scape, \n The ravening fowle with greedie eyes upon his pray doth gape. \n Now was their journey come to ende: now were they gone aland \n In Thracia , when that Tereus tooke the Ladie by the hand, \n And led hir to a pelting graunge that peakishly did stand \n In woods forgrowen. There waxing pale and trembling sore for feare, \n And dreading all things, and with teares demaunding sadly where \n Hir sister was, he shet hir up: and therewithall bewraide \n His wicked lust, and so by force bicause she was a Maide \n And all alone he vanquisht hir. It booted nought at all \n That she on sister, or on Sire, or on the Gods did call. \n She quaketh like the wounded Lambe which from the Wolves hore teeth \n New shaken thinkes hir selfe not safe: or as the Dove that seeth \n Hir fethers with hir owne bloud staynde, who shuddring still doth feare \n The greedie Hauke that did hir late with griping talants teare. \n Anon when that this mazednesse was somewhat overpast, \n She rent hir haire, and beate hir brest, and up to heavenward cast \n Hir hands in mourningwise, and said: O cankerd Carle, O fell \n And cruell Tyrant, neyther could the godly teares that fell \n Adowne my fathers cheekes when he did give thee charge of mee, \n Ne of my sister that regarde that ought to be in thee, \n Nor yet my chaaste virginitie, nor conscience of the lawe \n Of wedlocke, from this villanie thy barbrous heart withdraw? \n Is made a Cucqueane: and thy selfe through this offence of thee \n Art made a husband to us both, and unto me a foe, \n Behold thou hast confounded all. My sister thorough mee \n A just deserved punishment for lewdly doing so. \n But to th'intent, O perjurde wretch, no mischiefe may remaine \n Unwrought by thee, why doest thou from murdring me refraine? \n Would God thou had it done before this wicked rape. From hence \n Then should my soule most blessedly have gone without offence. \n But if the Gods doe see this deede, and if the Gods, I say, \n Be ought, and in this wicked worlde beare any kinde of sway \n And if with me all other things decay not, sure the day \n Will come that for this wickednesse full dearly thou shalt pay. \n Yea I my selfe rejecting shame thy doings will bewray. \n And if I may have power to come abrode, them blase I will \n In open face of all the world. Or if thou keepe me still \n As prisoner in these woods, my voyce the verie woods shall fill, \n And make the stones to understand. Let Heaven to this give care \n And all the Gods and powers therein if any God be there. \n The cruell tyrant being chaaft and also put in feare \n With these and other such hir wordes, both causes so him stung, \n That drawing out his naked sworde that at his girdle hung, \n He tooke hir rudely by the haire, and wrung hir hands behind hir, \n Compelling hir to holde them there while he himselfe did bind hir. \n When Philomela sawe the sworde, she hoapt she should have dide, \n And for the same hir naked throte she gladly did provide. \n But as she yirnde and called ay upon hir fathers name, \n And strived to have spoken still, the cruell tyrant came \n And with a paire of pinsons fast did catch hir by the tung, \n And with his sword did cut it off. The stumpe whereon it hung \n Did patter still. The tip fell downe and quivering on the ground \n As though that it had murmured it made a certaine sound. \n And as an Adders tayle cut off doth skip a while: even so \n The tip of Philomelaas tongue did wriggle to and fro, \n And nearer to hir mistresseward in dying still did go. \n And after this most cruell act, for certaine men report \n That he (I scarcely dare beleve) did oftentimes resort \n To maymed Philomela and abusde hir at his will: \n Yet after all this wickednesse he keeping countnance still, \n Durst unto Progne home repaire. And she immediatly \n Demaunded where hir sister was. He sighing feynedly \n Did tell hir falsly she was dead: and with his suttle teares \n He maketh all his tale to seeme of credit in hir eares. \n Hir garments glittring all with golde she from hir shoulders teares \n And puts on blacke, and setteth up an emptie Herce, and keepes \n A solemne obite for hir soule, and piteously she weepes \n And waileth for hir sisters fate who was not in such wise \n As that was, for to be bewailde. The Sunne had in the Skies \n Past through the twelve celestiall signes, and finisht full a yeare. \n But what should Philomela doe? She watched was so neare \n That start she could not for hir life. The walles of that same graunge \n Were made so high of maine hard stone, that out she could not raunge. \n Againe hir tunglesse mouth did want the utterance of the fact. \n Great is the wit of pensivenesse, and when the head is rakt \n With hard misfortune, sharpe forecast of practise entereth in. \n A warpe of white upon a frame of Thracia she did pin, \n And weaved purple letters in betweene it, which bewraide \n The wicked deede of Tereus. And having done, she praide \n A certaine woman by hir signes to beare them to hir mistresse. \n She bare them and deliverde them not knowing nerethelesse \n What was in them. The Tyrants wife unfolded all the clout, \n And of hir wretched fortune red the processe whole throughout. \n She held hir peace (a wondrous thing it is she should so doe) \n But sorrow tide hir tongue, and wordes agreeable unto \n Hir great displeasure were not at commaundment at that stound. \n And weepe she could not. Ryght and wrong she reckeneth to confound, \n And on revengement of the deede hir heart doth wholy ground.\n\n \n",
            "8":"\n\n It was the time that wives of Thrace were wont to celebrate \n The three yeare rites of Bacchus which were done a nighttimes late. \n A nighttimes soundeth Rhodope of tincling pannes and pots: \n A nighttimes giving up hir house abrode Queene Progne trots \n Disguisde like Bacchus other froes and armed to the proofe \n With all the frenticke furniture that serves for that behoofe. \n Hir head was covered with a vine. About hir loose was tuckt \n A Reddeeres skin, a lightsome Launce upon hir shoulder ruckt. \n In post gaddes terrible Progne through the woods, and at hir heeles \n A flocke of froes. And where the sting of sorrow which she feeles \n Enforceth hir to furiousnesse, she feynes it to proceede \n Of Bacchus motion. At the length she finding out in deede \n The outset Graunge howlde out, and cride, Now well, and open brake \n The gates, and streight hir sister thence by force of hand did take, \n And veyling hir in like attire of Bacchus, hid hir head \n With Ivie leaves, and home to Court hir sore amazed led. \n As soone as Philomela wist she set hir foote within \n That cursed house, the wretched soule to shudther did begin, \n And all hir face waxt pale. Anon hir sister getting place \n Did pull off Bacchus mad attire, and making bare hir face \n Embraced hir betweene hir armes. But she considering that \n Queene Progne was a Cucqueane made by meanes of hir, durst nat \n Once raise hir eyes: but on the ground fast fixed helde the same. \n And where she woulde have taken God to witnesse that the shame \n And villanie was wrought to hir by violence, she was fayne \n To use hir hand in stead of speache. Then Progne chaaft amaine, \n And was not able in hir selfe hir choler to restraine. \n But blaming Philomela for hir weeping, said these wordes: \n Thou must not deale in this behalfe with weeping, but with swordes: \n Or with some thing of greater force than swords. For my part, I \n Am readie, yea and fully bent all mischiefe for to trie. \n This pallace will I eyther set on fire, and in the same \n Bestow the cursed Tereus the worker of our shame: \n Or pull away his tongue: or put out both his eyes: or cut \n Away those members which have thee to such dishonor put: \n Or with a thousand woundes expulse that sinfull soule of his. \n The thing that I doe purpose on is great, what ere it is. \n I know not what it may be yet. While Progne hereunto \n Did set hir minde, came Itys in, who taught hir what to doe. \n She staring on him cruelly, said: Ah, how like thou art \n Thy wicked father, and without moe wordes a sorowfull part \n She purposed, such inward ire was boyling in hir heart. \n But notwithstanding when hir sonne approched to hir neare, \n And lovingly had greeted hir by name of mother deare, \n And with his pretie armes about the necke had hugde hir fast, \n And flattring wordes with childish toyes in kissing forth had cast, \n The mothers heart of hirs was then constreyned to relent, \n Asswaged wholy was the rage to which she erst was bent, \n And from hir eyes against hir will the teares enforced went. \n But when she saw how pitie did compell hir heart to yeelde, \n She turned to hir sisters face from Itys, and behelde \n Now t'one, now tother earnestly and said: Why tattles he \n And she sittes dumbe bereft of tongue? as well why calles not she \n Me sister, as this boy doth call me mother? Seest thou not, \n Thou daughter of Pandion, what a husband thou hast got? \n Thou growest wholy out of kinde. To such a husband as \n Is Tereus, pitie is a sinne. No more delay there was. \n She dragged Itys after hir, as when it happes in Inde \n A Tyger gets a little Calfe that suckes upon a Hynde \n And drags him through the shadie woods. And when that they had found \n A place within the house far off and far above the ground, \n Then Progne strake him with a sword now plainly seeing whother \n He should, and holding up his handes, and crying mother, mother, \n And flying to hir necke: even where the brest and side doe bounde, \n And never turnde away hir face. Inough had bene that wound \n Alone to bring him to his ende. The tother sister slit \n His throte. And while some life and soule was in his members yit, \n In gobbits they them rent: whereof were some in Pipkins boyld, \n And other some on hissing spits against the fire were broyld, \n And with the gellied bloud of him was all the chamber foyld. \n To this same banquet Progne bade hir husband knowing nought \n Nor nought mistrusting of the harme and lewdnesse she had wrought. \n And feyning a solemnitie according to the guise \n Of Athens , at the which there might be none in any wise \n Besides hir husband and hir selfe, she banisht from the same \n Hir householde folke and sojourners, and such as guestwise came. \n King Tereus sitting in the throne of his forefathers, fed \n And swallowed downe the selfesame flesh that of his bowels bred. \n And he (so blinded was his heart) Fetch Itys hither, sed. \n No lenger hir most cruell joy dissemble could the Queene. \n But of hir murther coveting the messenger to beene, \n She said: The thing thou askest for, thou hast within. About \n He looked round, and asked where? To put him out of dout, \n As he was yet demaunding where, and calling for him: out \n Lept Philomele with scattred haire aflaight like one that fled \n Had from some fray where slaughter was, and threw the bloudy head \n Of Itys in his fathers face. And never more was shee \n Desirous to have had hir speache, that able she might be \n Hir inward joy with worthie wordes to witnesse franke and free. \n The tyrant with a hideous noyse away the table shoves: \n And reeres the fiends from Hell. One while with yawning mouth he proves \n To perbrake up his meate againe, and cast his bowels out. \n Another while with wringing handes he weeping goes about. \n And of his sonne he termes himselfe the wretched grave. Anon \n With naked sword and furious heart he followeth fierce upon \n Pandions daughters. He that had bene present would have deemde \n Their bodies to have hovered up with fethers. As they seemde, \n So hovered they with wings in deede. Of whome the one away \n To woodward flies, the other still about the house doth stay. \n And of their murther from their brestes not yet the token goth, \n For even still yet are stainde with bloud the fethers of them both. \n And he through sorrow and desire of vengeance waxing wight, \n Became a Bird upon whose top a tuft of feathers light \n In likenesse of a Helmets crest doth trimly stand upright. \n In stead of his long sword, his bill shootes out a passing space: \n A Lapwing named is this Bird, all armed seemes his face.\n\n \n",
            "9":"\n\n The sorrow of this great mischaunce did stop Pandions breath \n Before his time, and long ere age determinde had his death. \n Erecthey reigning after him the government did take: \n A Prince of such a worthinesse as no man well can make \n Resolution, if he more in armes or justice did excell. \n Foure sonnes, and daughters foure he had. Of which a couple well \n Did eche in beautie other match. The one of these whose name \n Was Procris unto Cephalus, King Aeolus sonne, became \n A happie wife. The Thracians and King Tereus were a let \n To Boreas: so that long it was before the God could gt \n His dearbeloved Orithya, while trifling he did stand \n With faire entreatance rather than did use the force of hand. \n But when he saw he no reliefe by gentle meanes could finde, \n Then turning unto boystous wrath (which unto that same winde \n Is too familiar and too much accustomed by kinde) \n He said: I served am but well: for whylaid I apart \n My proper weapons, fiercenesse, force, and ire, and cruell hart? \n And fell to fauning like a foole, which did me but disgrace? \n For me is violence meete. Through this the pestred cloudes I chace. \n Through this I tosse the Seas. Through this I turne up knottie Okes, \n And harden Snow, and beate the ground in hayle with sturdie strokes, \n When I my brothers chaunce to get in open Ayre and Skie. \n (For that is my fielde in the which my maisteries I doe trie) \n I charge upon them with such brunt, that of our meeting smart \n The Heaven betweene us soundes, and from the hollow Cloudes doth start \n Enforced fire. And when I come in holes of hollow ground, \n And fiersly in those emptie caves doe rouse my backe up round, \n I trouble even the ghostes, and make the verie world to quake. \n This helpe in wooing of my wife (to speede) I should have take. \n Erecthey should not have bene prayde my Fatherinlaw to bee: \n He should have bene compelde thereto by stout extremitie. \n In speaking these or other wordes as sturdie, Boreas gan \n To flaske his wings. With waving of the which he raysed than \n So great a gale, that all the earth was blasted therewithall, \n And troubled was the maine brode Sea. And as he traylde his pall \n Bedusted over highest tops of things, he swept the ground. \n And having now in smokie cloudes himselfe enclosed round, \n Betweene his duskie wings he caught Orithya straught for feare, \n And like a lover, verie soft and easly did hir beare. \n And as he flew, the flames of love enkindled more and more \n By meanes of stirring. Neither did he stay his flight before \n He came within the land and towne of Cicons with his pray. \n And there soone after being made his wife she hapt to lay \n Hir belly, and a paire of boyes she at a burthen brings, \n Who else in all resembled full their mother, save in wings \n The which they of their father tooke. Howbeit (by report) \n They were not borne with wings upon their bodies in this sort. \n While Calais and Zetes had no beard upon their chin, \n They both were callow. But as soone as haire did once begin \n In likenesse of a yellow Downe upon their cheekes to sprout, \n Then (even as comes to passe in Birdes) the feathers budded out \n Togither on their pinyons too, and spreaded round about \n On both their sides. And finally when childhod once was spent \n And youth come on, togither they with other Minyes went \n To Colchos in the Galley that was first devisde in Greece , \n Upon a sea as then unknowen, to fetch the golden fleece. \n"

For what a wondrous thing is this? \n Is any thing like this which men doe terme by name of Love? \n For why should I my fathers hestes esteeme so hard above \n All measure? sure in very deede they are too hard and sore. \n Why feare I lest yon straunger whome I never saw before \n Should perish? what should be the cause of this my feare so great? \n Unhappie wench (and if thou canst) suppresse this uncouth heat \n That burneth in thy tender brest: and if so be I coulde, \n A happie turne it were, and more at ease then be I shoulde. \n But now an uncouth maladie perforce against my will \n Doth hale me. Love persuades me one, another thing my skill. \n The best I see and like: the worst I follow headlong still. \n Why being of the royall bloud so fondly doste thou rave, \n Upon a straunger thus to dote, desiring for to have \n An husband of another world? at home thou mightest finde \n A lover meete for thine estate on whome to set thy minde. \n And yet it is but even a chaunce if he shall live or no: \n God graunt him for to live. I may without offence pray so, \n Although I lovde him not: for what hath Jason trespast me? \n Who woulde not pitie Jasons youth onlesse they cruell be? \n What creature is there but his birth and prowesse might him move? \n And setting all the rest asyde, who woulde not be in love \n With Jasons goodlie personage? my heart assuredly \n Is toucht therewith. But if that I provide not remedie, \n With burning breath of blasting Bulles needes sindged must he bee. \n Of seedes that he himselfe must sow a harvest shall he see \n Of armed men in battell ray upon the ground up grow \n Against the which it hoveth him his manhode for to show. \n And as a pray he must be set against the Dragon fell. \n If I these things let come to passe, I may confesse right well \n That of a Tyger I was bred: and that within my brest \n A heart more harde than any steele or stonie rocke doth rest. \n Why rather doe I not his death with wrathfull eyes beholde? \n And joy with others seeing him to utter perill solde? \n Why doe I not enforce the Bulles against him? Why, I say, \n Exhort I not the cruell men which shall in battell ray \n Arise against him from the ground? and that same Dragon too \n Within whose eyes came never sleepe? God shield I so should doo. \n But prayer smally bootes, except I put to helping hand. \n And shall I like a Caytife then betray my fathers land? \n Shall I a straunger save whome we nor none of ours doth know? \n That he by me preserved may without me homeward row? \n And take another to his wife, and leave me, wretched wight, \n To torments? If I wist that he coulde worke me such a spight, \n Or could in any others love than only mine delight, \n The Churle should die for me. But sure he beareth not the face \n Like one that wold doe so. His birth, his courage, and his grace \n Doe put me clearly out of doubt he will not me deceyve, \n No nor forget the great good turnes he shall by me receyve. \n Yet shall he to me first his faith for more assurance plight \n And solemly he shall be sworne to keepe the covenant right. \n Why fearste thou now without a cause? step to it out of hand: \n And doe not any lenger time thus lingring fondly stand. \n For ay shall Jason thinke himselfe beholding unto thee: \n And shall thee marrie solemly: yea honored shalt thou bee \n Of all the Mothers great and small throughout the townes of Greece \n For saving of their sonnes that come to fetch the golden fleece. \n And shall I then leave brother, sister, father, kith and kin? \n And household Gods, and native soyle, and all that is therein? \n And saile I know not whither with a straunger? Yea: why not? \n My father surely cruell is, my Countrie rude God wot: \n My brother yet a verie babe: my sister I dare say \n Contented is with all hir heart that I should go away: \n The greatest God is in my selfe: the things I doe forsake \n Are trifles in comparison of those that I shall take. \n For saving of the Greekish ship renoumed shall I bee. \n A better place I shall enjoy with Cities riche and free, \n Whose fame doth florish fresh even here, and people that excell \n In civill life and all good Artes: and whome I would not sell \n For all the goods within the worlde, Duke Aesons noble sonne. \n Whome had I to my lawfull Feere assuredly once wonne, \n Most happie yea and blest of God I might my selfe account, \n And with my head above the starres to heaven I should surmount. \n But men report that certaine rockes (I know not what) doe meete \n Amid the waves, and monstrously againe asunder fleete: \n And how Charybdis, utter foe to ships that passe thereby, \n Now sowpeth in, now speweth out the Sea incessantly: \n And ravening Scylla being hemde with cruell dogs about, \n Amids the gulfe of Sicilie doth make a barking out. \n What skilleth that? As long as I enjoy the thing I love, \n And hang about my Jasons necke, it shall no whit me move \n To saile the daungerous Seas: as long as him I may embrace \n I cannot surely be afraide in any kinde of case. \n Or if I chaunce to be afraide, my feare shall only tende \n But for my husband. Callste thou him thy husband? Doste pretende \n Gay titles to thy foule offence, Medea? nay not so: \n But rather looke about how great a lewdnesse thou doste go, \n And shun the mischiefe while thou mayst. She had no sooner said \n These wordes, but right and godlinesse and shamefastnesse were staid \n Before hir eyes, and frantick love did flie away dismaid. \n She went me to an Altar that was dedicate of olde \n To Perseys daughter Hecate (of whome the witches holde \n As of their Goddesse) standing in a thicke and secrete wood \n So close it coulde not well be spide: and now the raging mood \n Of furious love was well alaide and clearely put to flight: \n When spying Aesons sonne, the flame that seemed quenched quight \n Did kindle out of hand againe. Hir cheekes began to glowe, \n And flushing over all hir face the scarlet bloud did flowe. \n And even as when a little sparke that was in ashes hid, \n Uncovered with the whisking windes is from the ashes rid, \n Eftsoones it taketh nourishment and kindleth in such wise, \n That to his former strength againe and flaming it doth rise: \n Even so hir quailed love which late ye would have thought had quight \n Bene vanisht out of minde, as soone as Jason came in sight \n Did kindle to his former force in vewing of the grace \n With which he did avaunce himselfe then comming there in place. \n And (as it chaunced) farre more faire and beautifull of face \n She thought him then than ever erst, but sure it doth behove \n Hir judgement should be borne withall bicause she was in love. \n She gapte and gazed in his face with fixed staring eyen \n As though she never had him seene before that instant time. \n So farre she was beside hir selfe she thought it should not bee \n The face of any worldly wight the which she then did see. \n She was not able for hir life to turne hir eyes away, \n But when he tooke hir by the hand and speaking gan to pray \n Hir softly for to succor him, and promisde faithfully \n To take hir to his wedded wife, she falling by and by \n A weeping, said: Sir, what I doe I see apparantly. \n Not want of knowledge of the truth but love shall me deceive. \n You shalbe saved by my meanes. And now I must receive \n A faithfull promise at your hand for saving of your life. \n He made a solemne vow, and sware to take hir to his wife, \n By triple Hecates holie rites, and by what other power \n So ever else had residence within that secret bower, \n And by the Sire of him that should his Fathrinlaw become \n Who all things doth behold, and as he hopte to overcome \n The dreadfull daungers which he had soone after to assay. \n Duke Jason being credited receivde of hir streight way \n Enchaunted herbes: and having learnde the usage of the same, \n Departed thence with merrie heart, and to his lodging came. \n Next Morne had chaste the streaming stars: and folke by heapes did flocke \n To Marsis sacred field, and there stoode thronging in a shocke, \n To see the straunge pastimes. The King most stately to beholde \n With yvorie Mace above them all did sit in throne of golde. \n Anon the brazenhoved Bulles from stonie nostrils cast \n Out flakes of fire: their scalding breath the growing grasse did blast. \n And looke what noise a chimney full of burning fewell makes, \n Or Flint in softning in the Kell when first the fire it takes \n By sprincling water thereupon: such noyse their boyling brests \n Turmoyling with the firie flames enclosed in their chests, \n Such noise their scorched throtebolles make. Yet stoutly Jason went \n To meete them. They their dreadfull eyes against him grimly bent, ' \n And eke their homes with yron tipt: and strake the dust about \n In stamping with their cloven clees: and with their belowing out \n Set all the fielde upon a smoke. The Mynies seeing that \n Were past their wits with sodaine feare, but Jason feeled nat \n So much as any breath of theirs: such strength hath sorcerie. \n Their dangling Dewlaps with his hand he coyd unfearfully. \n And putting yokes upon their neckes he forced them to draw \n The heavie burthen of the plough which erst they never saw, \n And for to breake the fielde which erst had never felt the share. \n The men of Colchos seeing this, like men amazed fare. \n The Mynies with their shouting out their mazednesse augment, \n And unto Jason therewithall give more encouragement. \n Then in a souldiers cap of steele a Vipers teeth he takes, \n And sowes them in the new plowde fielde. The ground then soking makes \n The seede foresteepte in poyson strong, both supple lithe and soft, \n And of these teeth a right straunge graine there growes anon aloft. \n For even as in the mothers wombe an infant doth begin \n To take the lively shape of man, and formed is within \n To due proportion piece by piece in every limme, and when \n Full ripe he is, he takes the use of Aire with other men: \n So when that of the Vipers teeth the perfect shape of man \n Within the bowels of the earth was formed, they began \n To rise togither orderly upon the fruitefull fielde: \n And (which a greater wonder is) immediatly they wielde \n Their weapons growing up with them, whom when the Greekes behilde \n Preparing for to push their Pikes (which sharply headed were) \n In Jasons face, downe went their heades, their heartes did faint for feare: \n And also she that made him safe began abasht to bee. \n For when against one naked man so huge an armie shee \n Beheld of armed enmies bent, hir colour did abate \n And sodainly both voyd of bloud and livelie heate she sate. \n And lest the chaunted weedes the which she had him given before \n Should faile at neede, a helping charme she whispred overmore, \n And practisde other secret Artes the which she kept in store. \n He casting streight a mightie stone amid his thickest foes, \n Doth voyde the battell from him selfe and turnes it unto those. \n These earthbred brothers by and by did one another wound \n And never ceased till that all lay dead upon the ground. \n The Greekes were glad, and in their armes did clasp their Champion stout, \n And clinging to him earnestly embraced him about. \n And thou fond Medea too couldst well have found in hart \n The Champion for to have embraste, but that withheld thou wart \n By shamefastnesse, and yet thou hadst embraced him, if dread \n Of stayning of thine honor had not staid thee in that stead. \n But yet as far forth as thou maist, thou doste in heart rejoyce, \n And secretly (although without expressing it in voyce) \n Doste thanke thy charmes and eke the Gods as Authors of the same. \n Now was remaining as the last conclusion of this game, \n By force of chaunted herbes to make the watchfull Dragon sleepe \n Within whose eyes came never winke: who had in charge to keepe \n The goodly tree upon the which the golden fleeces hung. \n With crested head, and hooked pawes, and triple spirting tung, \n Right ougly was he to beholde. When Jason had besprent \n Him with the juice of certaine herbes from Lethey River sent, \n And thrice had mumbled certaine wordes which are of force to cast \n So sound a sleepe on things that even as dead a time they last, \n Which make the raging surges calme and flowing Rivers stay, \n The dreadfull Dragon by and by (whose eyes before that day \n Wist never erst what sleeping ment) did fall so fast asleepe \n That Jason safely tooke the fleece of golde that he did keepe. \n Of which his bootie being proud, he led with him away \n The Author of his good successe another fairer pray: \n And so with conquest and a wife he loosde from Colchos strand, \n And in Larissa haven safe did go againe aland.\n\n \n",
            "1":"\n\n The auncient men of Thessalie togither with their wives \n To Church with offrings gone for saving of their childrens lives. \n Great heapes of fuming frankincense were fryed in the flame \n And vowed Bulles to sacrifice with homes faire gilded came. \n But from this great solemnitie Duke Aeson was away, \n Now at deathes door and spent with yeares. Then Jason thus gan say: \n O wife to whome I doe confesse I owe my life in deede, \n Though al things thou to me hast given, and thy deserts exceede \n Beleife: yet if enchauntment can, (for what so hard appeares \n Which strong enchauntment can not doe?) abate thou from my yeares, \n And add them to my fathers life. As he these wordes did speake, \n The teares were standing in his eyes. His godly sute did breake \n Medeas heart: who therewithall bethought hir of hir Sire \n In leaving whome she had exprest a far unlike desire. \n But yet bewraying not hir thoughts, she said: O Husband fie, \n What wickednesse hath scapt your mouth? Suppose you then that I \n Am able of your life the terme where I will to bestow? \n Let Hecat never suffer that. Your sute (as well you know) \n Against all right and reason is. But I will put in proofe \n A greater gift than you require and more for your behoofe. \n I will assay your father's life by cunning to prolong, \n And not with your yeares for to make him yong againe and strong: \n So our threeformed Goddesse graunt with present helpe to stand \n A furthrer of the great attempt the which I take in hand. \n Before the Moone should circlewise close both hir homes in one \n Three nightes were yet as then to come. As soon as that she shone \n Most full of light, and did behold the earth with fulsome face, \n Medea with hir haire not trust so much as in a lace, \n But flaring on hir shoulders twaine, and barefoote, with hir gowne \n Ungirded, gate hir out of doores and wandred up and downe \n Alone the dead time of the night. Both Man, and Beast, and Bird \n Were fast asleepe: the Serpents slie in trayling forward stird \n So softly as ye would have thought they still asleepe had bene. \n The moysting Ayre was whist. No leafe ye could have moving sene. \n The starres alonly faire and bright did in the welkin shine \n To which she lifting up hir handes did thrise hirselfe encline: \n And thrice with water of the brooke hir haire besprincled shee: \n And gasping thrise she opte hir mouth: and bowing downe hir knee \n Upon the bare hard ground, she said: O trustie time of night \n Most faithfull unto privities, O golden starres whose light \n Doth jointly with the Moone succeede the beames that blaze by day \n And thou three headed Hecate who knowest best the way \n To compasse this our great attempt and art our chiefest stay: \n Ye Charmes and Witchcrafts, and thou Earth which both with herbe and weed \n Of mightie working furnishest the Wizardes at their neede: \n Ye Ayres and windes: ye Elves of Hilles, of Brookes, of Woods alone, \n Of standing Lakes, and of the Night approche ye everychone. \n Through helpe of whom (the crooked bankes much wondring at the thing) \n I have compelled streames to run cleane backward to their spring. \n By charmes I make the calme Seas rough, and make the rough Seas plaine, \n And cover all the Skie with Cloudes and chase them thence againe. \n By charmes I raise and lay the windes, and burst the Vipers jaw. \n And from the bowels of the Earth both stones and trees doe draw. \n Whole woods and Forestes I remove: I make the Mountaines shake, \n And even the Earth it selfe to grone and fearfully to quake. \n I call up dead men from their graves: and thee lightsome Moone \n I darken oft, though beaten brasse abate thy perill soone. \n Our Sorcerie dimmes the Morning faire, and darkes the Sun at Noone. \n The flaming breath of firie Bulles ye quenched for my sake \n And caused their unwieldie neckes the bended yoke to take. \n Among the Earthbred brothers you a mortall war did set \n And brought asleepe the Dragon fell whose eyes were never shet. \n By meanes whereof deceiving him that had the golden fleece \n In charge to keepe, you sent it thence by Jason into Greece . \n Now have I neede of herbes that can by vertue of their juice \n To flowring prime of lustie youth old withred age reduce. \n I am assurde ye will it graunt. For not in vaine have shone \n These twincling starres, ne yet in vaine this Chariot all alone \n By drought of Dragons hither comes. With that was fro the Skie \n A Chariot softly glaunced downe, and stayed hard thereby. \n As soone as she had gotten up, and with hir hand had coyd \n The Dragons reined neckes, and with their bridles somewhat toyd, \n They mounted with hir in the Ayre, whence looking downe she saw \n The pleasant Temp of Thessalie , and made hir Dragons draw \n To places further from resort: and there she tooke the view \n What herbes on high mount Pelion , and what on Ossa grew, \n And what on mountaine Othris and on Pyndus growing were, \n And what Olympus (greater than mount Pyndus far) did beare. \n Such herbes of them as liked hir she pullde up roote and rinde \n Or cropt them with a hooked knife. And many she did finde \n Upon the bankes of Apidane agreeing to hir minde: \n And many at Amphrisus foords: and thou Enipeus eke \n Didst yeelde hir many pretie weedes of which she well did like. \n Peneus and Sperchius streames contributarie were, \n And so were Boebes rushie bankes of such as growed there. \n About Anthedon which against the Ile Euboea standes, \n A certaine kind of lively grasse she gathered with her handes, \n The name whereof was scarsly knowen or what the herbe could doe \n Untill that Glaucus afterward was chaunged thereinto. \n Nine dayes with winged Dragons drawen, nine nights in Chariot swift \n She searching everie field and frith from place to place did shift. \n She was no sooner home returnde but that the Dragons fell \n Which lightly of hir gathered herbes had taken but the smell, \n Did cast their sloughes and with their sloughes their riveled age forgo.\n\n \n",

Both the which as soone as she had dight \n With Vervain and with other shrubbes that on the fieldes doe rise, \n Not farre from thence she digde two pits: and making sacrifice \n Did cut a couple of blacke Rams throtes and filled with their blood \n The open pits, on which she pourde of warme milke pure and good \n A boll full, and another boll of honie clarifide. \n And babling to hir selfe therewith full bitterly she cride \n On Pluto and his ravisht wife the sovereigne states of Hell, \n And all the Elves and Gods that on or in the Earth doe dwell, \n To spare olde Aesons life a while, and not in hast deprive \n His limmes of that same aged soule which kept them yet alive. \n Whome when she had sufficiently with mumbling long besought, \n She bade that Aesons feebled corse should out of doores be brought \n Before the Altars. Then with charmes she cast him in so deepe \n A slumber, that upon the herbes he lay for dead asleepe. \n Which done she willed Jason thence a great way off to go \n And likewise all the Ministers that served hir as tho: \n And not presume those secretes with unhallowed eyes to see. \n They did as she commaunded them. When all were voyded, shee \n With scattred haire about hir eares like one of Bacchus froes \n Devoutly by and by about the burning Altars goes: \n And dipping in the pits of bloud a sort of clifted brandes \n Upon the Altars kindled them that were on both hir handes. \n And thrise with brimstone, thrise with fire, and thrise with water pure \n She purged Aesons aged corse that slept and slumbred sure. \n The medicine seething all the while a wallop in a pan \n Of brasse, to spirt and leape aloft and gather froth began. \n There boyled she the rootes, seedes, flowres, leaves, stalkes and juice togither \n Which from the fieldes of Thessalie she late had gathered thither. \n She cast in also precious stones fetcht from the furthest East \n And, which the ebbing Ocean washt, fine gravell from the West. \n She put thereto the deaw that fell upon a Monday night: \n And flesh and feathers of a Witch, a cursed odious wight \n Which in the likenesse of an Owle abrode a nightes did flie, \n And Infants in their cradels chaunge or sucke them that they die. \n The singles also of a Wolfe which when he list could take \n The shape of man, and when he list the same againe forsake. \n And from the River Cyniphis which is in Lybie lande \n She had the fine sheere scaled filmes of water snayles at hand. \n And of an endlesselived hart the liver had she got, \n To which she added of a Crowe that then had lived not \n So little as nine hundred yeares the head and Bill also. \n Now when Medea had with these and with a thousand mo \n Such other kinde of namelesse things bestead hir purpose through \n For lengthning of the old mans life, she tooke a withered bough \n Cut lately from an Olyf tree, and jumbling all togither \n Did raise the bottome to the brim: and as she stirred hither \n And thither with the withered sticke, behold it waxed greene. \n Anon the leaves came budding out: and sodenly were seene \n As many berries dangling downe as well the bough could beare. \n And where the fire had from the pan the scumming cast, or where \n The scalding drops did fall, the ground did springlike florish there, \n And flowres with fodder fine and soft immediatly arose. \n Which when Medea did behold, with naked knife she goes \n And cuttes the olde mans throte: and letting all his old bloud go \n Supplies it with the boyled juice: the which when Aeson tho \n Had at his mouth or at his wounde receyved in, his heare \n As well of head as beard from gray to coleblacke turned were. \n His leane, pale, hore, and withered corse grew fulsome, faire and fresh: \n His furrowed wrincles were fulfilde with yong and lustie flesh. \n His limmes waxt frolicke, baine and lithe: at which he wondring much, \n Remembred that at fortie yeares he was the same or such. \n And as from dull unwieldsome age to youth he backward drew: \n Even so a lively youthfull spright did in his heart renew. \n The wonder of this monstrous act had Bacchus seene from hie, \n And finding that to youthfull yeares his Nurses might thereby \n Restored bee, did at hir hand receive it as a gift.\n\n \n",
            "3":"\n\n And lest deceitfull guile should cease, Medea found a shift \n To feyne that Jason and hir selfe were falne at oddes in wroth: \n And thereupon in humble wise to Pelias Court she goth. \n Where forbicause the King himselfe was feebled sore with age, \n His daughters entertainde hir, whome Medea, being sage, \n Within a while through false pretence of feyned friendship brought \n To take hir baite. For as she tolde what pleasures she had wrought \n For Jason, and among the rest as greatest sadly tolde \n How she had made his father yong that withred was and olde, \n And taried long upon that point: they hoped glad and faine \n That their olde father might likewise his youthful yeares regaine. \n And this they craving instantly did proffer for hir paine \n What recompence she would desire. She helde hir peace a while \n As though she doubted what to doe: and with hir suttle guile \n Of counterfetted gravitie more eger did them make. \n As soone as she had promisde them to doe it for their sake, \n For more assurance of my graunt, your selves (quoth she) shall see \n The oldest Ram in all your flocke a Lambe streight made to bee \n By force of my confections strong. Immediatly a Ram \n So olde that no man thereabouts remembred him a Lam \n Was thither by his warped homes which turned inward to \n His hollow Temples, drawne: whose withred throte she slit in two. \n And when she cleane had drayned out that little bloud that was, \n Upon the fire with herbes of strength she set a pan of brasse, \n And cast his carcasse thereinto. The Medcine did abate \n The largenesse of his limmes and seard his dossers from his pate, \n And with his homes abridgde his yeares. Anon was plainly heard \n The bleating of a new yeand Lambe from mid the Ketleward. \n And as they wondred for to heare the bleating, streight the Lam \n Leapt out, and frisking ran to seeke the udder of some Dam. \n King Pelias daughters were amazde. And when they did beholde \n Hir promise come to such effect, they were a thousand folde \n More earnest at hir than before. Thrise Phoebus having pluckt \n The Collars from his horses neckes, in Iber had them duckt. \n And now in Heaven the streaming starres the fourth night shined cleare: \n When false Medea on the fire had hanged water shere, \n With herbes that had no powre at all. The King and all his garde \n Which had the charge that night about his person for to warde \n Were through hir nightspels and hir charmes in deadly sleepe all cast. \n And Pelias daughters with the Witch which eggde them forward, past \n Into his chamber by the watch, and compast in his bed. \n Then: Wherefore stand ye doubting thus like fooles, Medea sed. \n On: draw your swordes: and let ye out his old bloud, that I may \n Fill up his emptie veynes againe with youthfull bloud streight way. \n Your fathers life is in your handes: it lieth now in you \n To have him olde and withred still or yong and lustie. Now \n If any nature in ye be, and that ye doe not feede \n A fruitelesse hope, your dutie to your father doe with speede. \n Expulse his age by sword, and let the filthy matter out. \n Through these persuasions which of them so ever went about \n To shewe hirselfe most naturall, became the first that wrought \n Against all nature: and for feare she should be wicked thought, \n She executes the wickednesse which most to shun she sought. \n Yet was not any one of them so bolde that durst abide \n To looke upon their father when she strake, but wride aside \n Hir eyes: and so their cruell handes not marking where they hit \n With faces turnde another way at all aventure smit. \n He all beweltred in his bloud awaked with the smart, \n And maimde and mangled as he was did give a sodeyne start \n Endevoring to have risen up. But when he did beholde \n Himselfe among so many swordes, he lifting up his olde \n Pale waryish armes, said: Daughters mine what doe ye? who hath put \n These wicked weapons in your hands your fathers throte to cut? \n With that their heartes and handes did faint. And as he talked yet, \n Medea breaking off his wordes, his windpipe quickly slit, \n And in the scalding liquor torne did drowne him by and by. \n\n \n",

            "5":"\n\n And now was Thesey prest, \n Unknowne unto his father yet, who by his knightly force \n Had set from robbers cleare the balke that makes the streight divorce \n Betweene the seas Ionian and Aegean . To have killde \n This worthie knight, Medea had a Goblet readie fillde \n With juice of Flintwoort venemous the which she long ago \n Had out of Scythie with hir brought. The common bruit is so \n That of the teeth of Cerberus this Flintwoort first did grow. \n There is a cave that gapeth wide with darksome entrie low, \n There goes a way slope downe by which with triple cheyne made new \n Of strong and sturdie Adamant the valiant Hercle drew \n The currish Helhounde Cerberus: who dragging arsward still \n And writhing backe his scowling eyes bicause he had no skill \n To see the Sunne and open day, for verie moodie wroth \n Three barkings yelled out at once, and spit his slavering froth \n Upon the greenish grasse. This froth (as men suppose) tooke roote \n And thriving in the batling soyle in burgeons forth did shoote, \n To bane and mischiefe men withall: and forbicause the same \n Did grow upon the bare hard Flints, folke gave the foresaid name \n Of Flintwoort thereunto. The King by egging of his Queene \n Did reach his sonne this bane as if he had his enmie beene. \n And Thesey of this treason wrought not knowing ought had tane \n The Goblet at his fathers hand which helde his deadly bane: \n When sodenly by the Ivorie hilts that were upon his sword \n Aegeus knew he was his sonne: and rising from the borde \n Did strike the mischiefe from his mouth. Medea with a charme \n Did cast a mist and so scapte death deserved for the harme \n Entended. Now albeit that Aegeus were right glad \n That in the saving of his sonne so happy chaunce he had, \n Yet grieved it his heart full sore that such a wicked wight \n With treason wrought against his sonne should scape so cleare and quight. \n Then fell he unto kindling fire on Altars everie where \n And glutted all the Gods with gifts. The thicke neckt Oxen were \n With garlands wreathd about their homes knockt downe for sacrifice. \n A day of more solemnitie than this did never rise \n Before on Athens (by report). The auncients of the Towne \n Made feastes: so did the meaner sort, and every common clowne. \n And as the wine did sharpe their wits, they sung this song: O knight \n Of peerlesse prowesse Theseus, thy manhod and thy might \n Through all the coast of Marathon with worthie honor soundes, \n For killing of the Cretish Bull that wasted those same groundes. \n The folke of Cremyon thinke themselves beholden unto thee. \n For that without disquieting their fieldes may tilled be. \n By thee the land of Epidaure behelde the clubbish sonne \n Of Vulcane dead. By thee likewise the countrie that doth runne \n Along Cephisus bankes behelde the fell Procrustes slaine. \n The dwelling place of Ceres, our Eleusis glad and faine, \n Beheld the death of Cercyon. That orpid Sinis who \n Abusde his strength in bending trees and tying folke thereto, \n Their limmes asunder for to teare when loosened from the stops \n The trees unto their proper place did trice their streyned tops, \n Was killde by thee. Thou made the way that leadeth to the towne \n Alcathoe in Beotia cleare by putting Scyron downe. \n To this same outlawes scattred bones the land denied rest, \n And likewise did the Sea refuse to harbrough such a guest: \n Till after floting to and fro long while as men doe say \n At length they hardened into stones: and at this present day \n The stones are called Scyrons cliffes. Now if we should account \n Thy deedes togither with thy yeares, thy deedes would far surmount \n Thy yeares. For thee, most valiant Prince, these publike vowes we keepe \n For thee with cherefull heartes we quaffe these bolles of wine so deepe. \n The Pallace also of the noyse and shouting did resounde \n The which the people made for joy.

            "6":"\n\n Nathelesse \n (So hard it is of perfect joy to find so great excesse, \n But that some sorrow therewithall is medled more or lesse), \n Aegeus had not in his sonnes recoverie such delight, \n But that there followed in the necke a piece of fortunes spight. \n King Minos was preparing war, who though he had great store \n Of ships and souldiers yet the wrath the which he had before \n Conceyved in his fathers brest for murthring of his sonne \n Androgeus made him farre more strong and fiercer for to ronne \n To rightfull battell to revenge the great displeasure donne. \n Howbeit he thought it best ere he his warfare did begin \n To finde the meanes of forreine aides some friendship for to win. \n And thereupon with flying fleete where passage did permit \n He went to visit all the Iles that in those seas doe sit. \n Anon the Iles Astypaley and Anaphey both twaine \n The first constreynde for feare of war, the last in hope of gaine, \n Tooke part with him. Low Myconey did also with him hold \n So did the chalkie Cymoley, and Syphney which of olde \n Was verie riche with veynes of golde, and Scyros full of bolde \n And valiant men, and Seryphey the smooth or rather fell, \n And Parey which for Marblestone doth beare away the bell. \n And Sythney which a wicked wench callde Arne did betray \n For mony: who upon receit thereof without delay \n Was turned to a birde which yet of golde is gripple still, \n And is as blacke as any cole, both fethers, feete and bill. \n A Cadowe is the name of hir. But yet Olyarey, \n And Didymey, and Andrey eke, and Tene, and Gyarey, \n And Pepareth where Olive trees most plenteously doe grow, \n In no wise would agree their helpe on Minos to bestow. \n Then Minos turning lefthandwise did sayle to Oenope \n Where reignde that time King Aeacus. This Ile had called be \n Of old by name of Oenope: but Aeacus turnde the name \n And after of his mothers name Aegina callde the same. \n The common folke ran out by heapes desirous for to see \n A man of such renowne as Minos bruited was to bee. \n The Kings three sonnes Duke Telamon, Duke Peley, and the yong \n Duke Phocus went to meete with him. Old Aeacus also clung \n With age, came after leysurely, and asked him the cause \n Of his repaire. The ruler of the hundred Shires gan pause: \n And musing on the inward griefe that nipt him at the hart, \n Did shape him aunswere thus: O Prince vouchsafe to take my part \n In this same godly warre of mine: assist me in the just \n Revengement of my murthred sonne that sleepeth in the dust. \n I crave your comfort for his death. Aeginas sonne replide: \n Thy suite is vaine: and of my Realme perforce must be denide. \n For unto Athens is no lande more sure than this alide: \n Such leagues betweene us are which shall infringde for me abide. \n Away went Minos sad: and said: full dearly shalt thou bie \n Thy leagues. He thought it for to be a better pollicie \n To threaten war than war to make, and there to spend his store \n And strength which in his other needes might much availe him more. \n As yet might from Oenopia walles the Cretish fleete be kend. \n When thitherward with puffed sayles and wind at will did tend \n A ship from Athens , which anon arriving at the strand \n Set Cephal with Ambassade from his Countrimen aland. \n The Kings three sonnes though long it were since last they had him seene, \n Yet knew they him. And after olde acquaintance eft had beene \n Renewde by shaking hands, to Court they did him streight convay. \n This Prince which did allure the eyes of all men by the way, \n As in whose stately person still remained to be seene \n The markes of beautie which in flowre of former yeares had beene, \n Went holding out an Olife braunch that grew in Atticke lande \n And for the reverence of his age there went on eyther hand \n A Nobleman of yonger yeares. Sir Clytus on the right \n And Butes on the left, the sonnes of one that Pallas hight. \n When greeting first had past betweene these Nobles and the King, \n Then Cephal setting streight abroche the message he did bring, \n Desired aide: and shewde what leagues stoode then in force betweene \n His countrie and the Aeginites, and also what had beene \n Decreed betwixt their aunceters, concluding in the ende \n That under colour of this war which Minos did pretende \n To only Athens , he in deede the conquest did intende \n Of all Achaia . When he thus by helpe of learned skill \n His countrie message furthred had, King Aeacus leaning still \n His left hand on his scepter, saide: My Lordes, I would not have \n Your state of Athens seeme so straunge as succor here to crave. \n I pray commaund. For be ye sure that what this Ile can make \n Is yours. Yea all that ere I have shall hazard for your sake. \n I want no strength. I have such store of souldiers, that I may \n Both vex my foes and also keepe my Realme in quiet stay. \n And now I thinke me blest of God that time doth serve to showe \n Without excuse the great good will that I to Athens owe. \n God holde it sir (quoth Cephalus) God make the number grow \n Of people in this towne of yours: it did me good alate \n When such a goodly sort of youth of all one age and rate \n Did meete me in the streete. But yet me thinkes that many misse \n Which at my former being here I have beheld ere this. \n At that the King did sigh, and thus with plaintfull voice did say: \n A sad beginning afterward in better lucke did stay. \n I would I plainly could the same before your faces lay. \n Howbeit I will disorderly repeate it as I may. \n And lest I seeme to wearie you with overlong delay, \n The men that you so mindefully enquire for lie in ground \n And nought of them save bones and dust remayneth to be found. \n But as it hapt what losse thereby did unto me redound? \n A cruell plague through Junos wrath who dreadfully did hate \n This Land that of hir husbands Love did take the name alate, \n Upon my people fell: as long as that the maladie \n None other seemde than such as haunts mans nature usually, \n And of so great mortalitie the hurtfull cause was hid, \n We strove by Phisicke of the same the Pacients for to rid. \n The mischief overmaistred Art: yea Phisick was to seeke \n To doe it selfe good. First the Aire with foggie stinking reeke \n Did daily overdreepe the earth: and close culme Clouds did make \n The wether faint: and while the Moone foure times hir light did take \n And fillde hir emptie homes therewith, and did as often slake: \n The warme South windes with deadly heate continually did blow. \n Infected were the Springs, and Ponds, and streames that ebbe and flow. \n And swarmes of Serpents crawld about the fieldes that lay untillde \n Which with their poison even the brookes and running water fillde. \n In sodaine dropping downe of Dogs, of Horses, Sheepe and Kine, \n Of Birds and Beasts both wild and tame as Oxen, Wolves, and Swine, \n The mischiefe of this secret sore first outwardly appeeres. \n The wretched Plowman was amazde to see his sturdie Steeres \n Amid the furrow sinking downe ere halfe his worke was donne. \n Whole flocks of sheepe did faintly bleate, and therewithall begonne \n Their fleeces for to fall away and leave the naked skin, \n And all their bodies with the rot attainted were within. \n The lustie Horse that erst was fierce in field renowne to win \n Against his kinde grew cowardly: and now forgetting quight \n The auncient honor which he preast so oft to get in fight, \n Stoode sighing sadly at the Racke as wayting for to yeelde \n His wearie life without renowne of combat in the fielde. \n The Boare to chafe, the Hinde to runne, the cruell Beare to fall \n Upon the herdes of Rother beastes had now no lust at all. \n A languishing was falne on all. In wayes, in woods, in plaines, \n The filthie carions lay, whose stinche, the Ayre it selfe distaines. \n (A wondrous thing to tell) not Dogges, not ravening Foules, nor yit \n Horecoted Wolves would once attempt to tast of them a bit. \n Looke, where they fell, there rotted they: and with their savor bred \n More harme, and further still abrode the foule infection spred.\n\n \n",
            "7":"\n\n With losse that touched yet more nere, on Husbandmen it crept, \n And ragingly within the walles of this great Citie stept. \n It tooke men first with swelting heate that scalt their guts within: \n The signes whereof were steaming breath and firie colourde skin. \n The tongue was harsh and swolne, the mouth through drought of burning veines \n Lay gaping up to hale in breath, and as the pacient streines \n To draw it in, he suckes therewith corrupted Aire beside. \n No bed, no clothes though nere so thinne the pacients could abide. \n But laide their hardened stomackes flat against the bare colde ground \n Yet no abatement of the heate therein their bodies found: \n But het the earth, and as for Leache was none that helpe could hight. \n The Surgians and Phisitions too were in the selfesame plight. \n Their curelesse cunning hurt themselves. The nerer any man \n Approcheth his diseased friend, and doth the best he can \n To succor him most faithfully, the sooner did he catch \n His bane. All hope of health was gone. No easment nor dispatch \n Of this disease except in death and buriall did they finde. \n Looke, whereunto that eche mans minde and fancie was enclinde, \n That followed he. He never past what was for his behoofe. \n For why? that nought could doe them good was felt too much by proofe. \n In everie place without respect of shame or honestie \n At Wels , at brookes, at ponds, at pits, by swarmes they thronging lie: \n But sooner might they quench their life than staunch their thirst thereby. \n And therewithall so heavie and unwieldie they become, \n That wanting power to rise againe, they died there. Yet some \n The selfesame waters guzled still without regard of feare, \n So weary of their lothsome beds the wretched people were, \n That out they lept: or if to stand their feeble force denide, \n They wallowed downe and out of doores immediatly them hide: \n It was a death to every man his owne house to abide. \n And for they did not know the cause whereof the sicknesse came, \n The place (bicause they did it know) was blamed for the same. \n Ye should have seene some halfe fordead go plundring here and there \n By highways sides while that their legges were able them to beare. \n And some lie weeping on the ground or rolling piteously \n Their wearie eyes which afterwards should never see the Skie: \n Or stretching out their limmes to Heaven that overhangs on hie, \n Some here, some there, and yonder some, in what so ever coste \n Death finding them enforced them to yeelde their fainting Ghoste. \n What heart had I, suppose you, then, or ought I then to have? \n In faith I might have lothde my life, and wisht me in my grave \n As other of my people were. I could not cast mine eie \n In any place, but that dead folke there strowed I did spie \n Even like as from a shaken twig when rotten Apples drop, \n Or Mast from Beches, Holmes or Okes when Poales doe scare their top. \n Yon stately Church with greeces long against our Court you see: \n It is the shrine of Jupiter . What Wight was he or shee \n That on those Altars burned not their frankincense in vaine? \n How oft, yet even with Frankincense that partly did remaine \n Still unconsumed in their hands, did die both man and wife, \n As ech of them with mutuall care did pray for others life? \n How often dyde the mother there in suing for hir sonne, \n Unheard upon the Altarstone, hir prayer scarce begonne? \n How often at the Temple doore even while the Priest did bid \n His Beades, and poure pure wine betwene their homes, at sodaine slid \n The Oxen downe without stroke given? Yea once when I had thought \n My selfe by offring sacrifice Joves favor to have sought, \n For me, my Realme, and these three ymps, the Oxe with grievous grone \n Upon the sodaine sunke me downe: and little bloud or none \n Did issue scarce to staine the knife with which they slit his throte. \n The sickly inwardes eke had lost the signes whereby we note \n What things the Gods for certaintie would warne us of before: \n For even the verie bowels were attainted with the sore. \n Before the holie Temple doores, and (that the death might bee \n The more dispitefull) even before the Altars did I see \n The stinking corses scattred. Some with haltars stopt their winde, \n By death expulsing feare of death: and of a wilfull minde \n Did haste their ende, which of it selfe was coming on apace. \n The bodies which the plague had slaine were (O most wretched case) \n Not caried forth to buriall now. For why such store there was \n That scarce the gates were wyde inough for Coffins forth to passe. \n So eyther lothly on the ground unburied did they lie, \n Or else without solemnitie were burnt in bonfires hie. \n No reverence nor regard was had. Men fell togither by \n The eares for firing. In the fire that was prepared for one \n Another straungers corse was burnt. And lastly few or none \n Were left to mourne. The sillie soules of Mothers with their small \n And tender babes, and age with youth as Fortune did befall \n Went wandring gastly up and downe unmourned for at all. \n In fine so farre outrageously this helpelesse Murren raves, \n There was not wood inough for fire, nor ground inough for graves. \n Astonied at the stourenesse of so stout a storme of ills \n I said: O father Jupiter whose mightie power fulfills \n Both Heaven and Earth, if flying fame report thee not amisse \n In vouching that thou didst embrace in way of Love ere this \n The River Asops daughter, faire Aegina even by name, \n And that to take me for thy sonne thou count it not a shame: \n Restore thou me my folke againe, or kill thou me likewise. \n He gave a signe by sodaine flash of lightning from the Skies, \n And double peale of Thundercracks. I take this same (quoth I) \n And as I take it for a true and certaine signe whereby \n Thou doest confirme me for thy sonne: so also let it be \n A hansell of some happie lucke thou mindest unto me. \n Hard by us as it hapt that time, there was an Oken tree \n With spreaded armes as bare of boughes as lightly one shall see. \n This tree (as all the rest of Okes) was sacred unto Jove \n And sprouted of an Acorne which was fet from Dodon grove. \n Here markt we how the pretie Ants, the gatherers up of graine, \n One following other all along in order of a traine, \n Great burthens in their little mouthes did painfully sustaine: \n And nimbly up the rugged barke their beaten path maintaine. \n As wondring at the swarme I stoode, I said: O father deere \n As many people give thou me, as Ants are creeping heere. \n And fill mine empty walles againe. Anon the Oke did quake, \n And unconstreynde of any blast, his loftie braunches shake, \n The which did yeeld a certaine sound. With that for dreadfull feare \n A shuddring through my bodie strake and up stoode stiffe my heare. \n But yet I kissed reverently the ground and eke the tree. \n Howbeit I durst not be so bolde of hope acknowne to bee. \n Yet hoped I: and in my heart did shroude my secret hope.\n\n \n",
            "8":"\n\n Anon came night: and sleepe upon my carefull carcasse crope. \n Me thought I saw the selfesame Oke with all his boughes and twigs, \n And all the Pismeres creeping still upon his tawnts and sprigs, \n Which trembling with a sodaine brayd these Harvest folke off threw \n And shed them on the ground about, who on the sodaine grew \n In bignesse more and more, and from the earth themselves did lift: \n And stoode upright against the tree: and therewithall did shift \n Their maygernesse, and coleblacke hue, and number of their feete: \n And clad their limmes with shape of man. Away my sleepe did fleete. \n And when I wooke, misliking of my dreame I made my mone \n That in the Gods I did perceive but slender helpe or none. \n But straight much trampling up and downe and shuffling did I heare, \n And (which to me that present time did verie straunge appeare) \n Of people talking in my house me thought I heard the reare. \n Now while I musing on the same supposde it to have been \n Some fancie of the foolish dreame which lately I had seen, \n Behold, in comes me Telamon in hast, and thrusting ope \n My Chamber doore, said: Sir, a sight of things surmounting hope \n And credit shall you have: come forth. Forth came I by and by \n And even such men for all the world there standing did I spie \n As in my sleepe I dreamed of, and knew them for the same. \n They comming to me greeted me, their sovereigne Lord, by name. \n And I (my vowes to Jove performde) my Citie did devide \n Among my new inhabiters: and gave them land beside \n Which by decease of such as were late owners of the same \n Lay wast. And in remembrance of the race whereof they came, \n The name of Emets I them gave. Their persons you have seen: \n Their disposition is the same that erst in them hath been. \n They are a sparing kinde of folke, on labor wholy set, \n A gatherer, and a hoorder up of such as they doe get. \n These fellowes being like in yeares and courage of the minde, \n Shall go a warfare ny as soone as that the Easterne winde \n Which brought you hither luckely, (the Easterne winde was it \n That brought them thither) turning, to the Southerne coast doe flit. \n\n \n",
            "9":"\n\n With this and other such like talke they brought the day to ende. \n The Even in feasting, and the night in sleeping they did spende. \n The Sunne next Morrow in the heaven with golden beames did burne, \n And still the Easterne winde did blow and hold them from returne. \n Sir Pallas sonnes to Cephal came (for he their elder was) \n And he and they to Aeacus Court togither forth did passe. \n The King as yet was fast asleepe. Duke Phocus at the gate \n Did meete them, and receyved them according to their state. \n For Telamon and Peleus alreadie forth were gone, \n To muster Souldiers for the warres. So Phocus all alone \n Did leade them to an inner roume, where goodly Parlours were, \n And caused them to sit them downe. As he was also there \n Now sitting with them, he beheld a Dart in Cephals hand \n With golden head, the stele whereof he well might understand \n Was of some straunge and unknowne tree. When certain talke had past \n A while of other matters there, I am (quoth he) at last \n A man that hath delight in woods and loves to follow game \n And yet I am not able sure by any meanes to ame \n What wood your Javeling stele is of. Of Ash it can not bee. \n For then the colour should be browne. And if of Cornell tree, \n It would be full of knubbed knots. I know not what it is: \n But sure mine eies did never see a fairer Dart than this. \n The one of those same brethren twaine replying to him said: \n Nay then the speciall propertie will make you more dismaid, \n Than doth the beautie of this Dart. It hitteth whatsoever \n He throwes it at. The stroke thereof by Chaunce is ruled never. \n For having done his feate, it flies all bloudie backe agen \n Without the helpe of any hand. The Prince was earnest then \n To know the truth of all: as whence so riche a present came, \n Who gave it him, and whereupon the partie gave the same. \n Duke Cephal answerde his demaund in all points (one except) \n The which (as knowne apparantly) for shame he overlept: \n His beautie namely, for the which he did receive the Dart. \n And for the losse of his deare wife right pensive at the hart, \n He thus began with weeping eies: This Dart, O Goddesse sonne, \n (Ye ill would thinke it) makes me yirne, and long shall make me donne, \n If long the Gods doe give me life. This weapon hath undonne \n My deare beloved wife and me. O would to God this same \n Had never unto me bene given. There was a noble Dame \n That Procris hight (but you perchaunce have oftner heard the name \n Of great Orythia whose renowne was bruited so by fame, \n That blustring Boreas ravisht hir.) To this Orythia shee \n Was sister. If a bodie should compare in ech degree \n The face and natures of them both, he could none other deeme \n But Procris worthier of the twaine of ravishment should seeme. \n Hir father and our mutuall love did make us man and wife. \n Men said I had (and so I had in deede) a happie life. \n Howbeit Gods will was otherwise, for had it pleased him \n Of all this while, and even still yet in pleasure should I swim. \n The second Month that she and I by band of lawfull bed \n Had joynde togither bene, as I my masking Toyles did spred, \n To overthrow the horned Stags, the early Morning gray \n Then newly having chased night and gun to breake the day, \n From Mount Hymettus highest tops that freshly flourish ay, \n Espide me, and against my will conveyde me quight away. \n I trust the Goddesse will not be offended that I say \n The troth of hir. Although it would delight one to beholde \n Hir ruddie cheekes: although of day and night the bounds she holde: \n Although on juice of Ambrosie continually she feede: \n Yet Procris was the only Wight that I did love in deede. \n On Procris only was my heart: none other word had I \n But Procris only in my mouth: still Procris did I crie. \n I upned what a holy thing was wedlocke: and how late \n It was ago since she and I were coupled in that state. \n Which band (and specially so soone) it were a shame to breake. \n The Goddesse being moved at the words that I did speake, \n Said: Cease thy plaint, thou Carle, and keepe thy Procris still for me. \n But (if my minde deceyve me not) the time will shortly be \n That wish thou wilt thou had hir not. And so in anger she \n To Procris sent me backe againe. In going homeward as \n Upon the Goddesse sayings with my selfe I musing was, \n I gan to dreade bad measures lest my wife had made some scape. \n Hir youthfull yeares begarnished with beautie, grace and shape, \n In maner made me to beleve the deede already done. \n Againe hir maners did forbid mistrusting over soone. \n But I had bene away: but even the same from whom I came \n A shrewde example gave how lightly wives doe run in blame: \n But we poore Lovers are afraide of all things. Hereupon \n I thought to practise feates: which thing repented me anon: \n And shall repent me while I live. The purpose of my drifts \n Was for t'assault hir honestie with great rewards and gifts. \n The Morning fooding this my feare, to further my device, \n My shape (which thing me thought I felt) had altered with a trice. \n By meanes whereof anon unknowne to Pallas towne I came, \n And entred so my house: the house was clearely voide of blame: \n And shewed signes of chastitie in mourning ever sith \n Their maister had bene rapt away. A thousand meanes wherewith \n To come to Procris speach had I devisde: and scarce at last \n Obteinde I it. As soone as I mine eie upon hir cast, \n My wits were ravisht in such wise that nigh I had forgot \n The purposde triall of hir troth. Right much adoe God wot \n I had to holde mine owne that I the truth bewrayed not. \n To keepe my selfe from kissing hir full much adoe I had \n As reason was I should have done. She looked verie sad. \n And yet as sadly as she lookte, no Wight alive can show \n A better countenance than did she. Hir heart did inward glow \n In longing for hir absent spouse. How beautifull a face \n Thinke you, Sir Phocus, was in hir whome sorrow so did grace? \n What should I make report how oft hir chast behaviour strave \n And overcame most constantly the great assaults I gave? \n Or tell how oft she shet me up with these same words? To one \n (Where ere he is) I keepe my selfe, and none but he alone \n Shall sure enjoy the use of me. What creature having his \n Wits perfect would not be content with such a proofe as this \n Of hir most stedfast chastitie? I could not be content: \n But still to purchase to my selfe more wo I further went. \n At last by profering endlesse welth, and heaping gifts on gifts, \n In overlading hir with wordes I drave hir to hir shifts. \n Then cride I out: Thine evill heart my selfe I tardie take. \n Where of a straunge advouterer the countenance I did make, \n I am in deede thy husband. O unfaithfull woman thou, \n Even I my selfe can testifie thy lewde behavior now. \n She made none answere to my words, but being stricken dum \n And with the sorrow of hir heart alonly overcum, \n Forsaketh hir entangling house, and naughtie husband quight: \n And hating all the sort of men by reason of the spight \n That I had wrought hir, straide abrode among the Mountaines hie, \n And exercisde Dianas feates. Then kindled by and by \n A fiercer fire within my bones than ever was before, \n When she had thus forsaken me by whome I set such store. \n I prayde hir she woulde pardon me, and did confesse my fault. \n Affirming that my selfe likewise with such a great assault \n Of richesse might right well have bene enforst to yeelde to blame, \n The rather if performance had ensewed of the same. \n When I had this submission made, and she sufficiently \n Revengde hir wronged chastitie, she then immediatly \n Was reconcilde: and afterward we lived many a yeare \n In joy and never any jarre betweene us did appeare. \n Besides all this (as though hir love had bene too small a gift) \n She gave me eke a goodly Grewnd which was of foote so swift, \n That when Diana gave him hir, she said he should outgo \n All others, and with this same Grewnd she gave this Dart also \n The which you see I hold in hand. Perchaunce ye faine would know \n What fortune to the Grewnd befell. I will unto you show \n A wondrous case. The straungenesse of the matter will you move. \n\n \n",
            "10":"\n\n The krinkes of certaine Prophesies surmounting farre above \n The reach of auncient wits to read, the Brookenymphes did expound: \n And mindlesse of hir owne darke doubts Dame Themis being found, \n Was as a rechelesse Prophetisse throwne flat against the ground. \n For which presumptuous deede of theirs she tooke just punishment. \n To Thebes in Baeotia streight a cruell beast she sent, \n Which wrought the bane of many a Wight. The countryfolk did feed \n Him with their cattell and themselves, untill (as was agreed) \n That all we youthfull Gentlemen that dwelled there about \n Assembling pitcht our corded toyles the champion fields throughout. \n But Net ne toyle was none so hie that could his wightnesse stop, \n He mounted over at his ease the highest of the top. \n Then everie man let slip their Grewnds, but he them all outstript \n And even as nimbly as a birde in daliance from them whipt. \n Then all the field desired me to let my Laelaps go: \n (The Grewnd that Procris unto me did give was named so) \n Who strugling for to wrest his necke already from the band \n Did stretch his collar. Scarsly had we let him off of hand \n But that where Laelaps was become we could not understand. \n The print remained of his feete upon the parched sand, \n But he was clearly out of sight. Was never Dart I trow, \n Nor Pellet from enforced Sling, nor shaft from Cretish bow, \n That flew more swift than he did runne. There was not farre fro thence \n About the middle of the Laund a rising ground, from whence \n A man might overlooke the fieldes. I gate me to the knap \n Of this same hill, and there beheld of this straunge course the hap \n In which the beast seemes one while caught, and ere a man would think, \n Doth quickly give the Grewnd the slip, and from his bighting shrink: \n And like a wilie Foxe he runnes not forth directly out, \n Nor makes a windlasse over all the champion fieldes about, \n But doubling and indenting still avoydes his enmies lips, \n And turning short, as swift about as spinning wheele he whips, \n To disapoint the snatch. The Grewnd pursuing at an inch \n Doth cote him, never losing ground: but likely still to pinch \n Is at the sodaine shifted off. Continually he snatches \n In vaine: for nothing in his mouth save only Aire he latches. \n Then thought I for to trie what helpe my Dart at neede could show. \n Which as I charged in my hand by levell aime to throw, \n And set my fingars to the thongs, I lifting from bylow \n Mine eies, did looke right forth againe, and straight amids the field \n (A wondrous thing) two Images of Marble I beheld: \n Of which ye would have thought the t'one had fled on still apace \n And that with open barking mouth the tother did him chase. \n In faith it was the will of God (at least if any Goddes \n Had care of them) that in their pace there should be found none oddes. \n Thus farre: and then he held his peace. But tell us ere we part \n (Quoth Phocus) what offence or fault committed hath your Dart? \n His Darts offence he thus declarde: My Lorde, the ground of all \n My grief was joy. Those joyes of mine remember first I shall. \n It doth me good even yet to thinke upon that blissfull time \n ( meane the fresh and lustie yeares of pleasant youthfull Prime) \n When I a happie man enjoyde so faire and good a wife, \n And she with such a loving make did lead a happie life. \n The care was like of both of us, the mutuall love all one. \n She would not to have line with Jove my presence have forgone. \n Ne was there any Wight that could of me have wonne the love, \n No though Dame Venus had hir selfe descended from above. \n The glowing brands of love did burne in both our brests alike. \n Such time as first with crased beames the Sunne is wont to strike \n The tops of Towres and mountaines high, according to the wont \n Of youthfull men, in woodie Parkes I went abrode to hunt. \n But neither horse nor Hounds to make pursuit upon the scent. \n Nor Servingman, nor knottie toyle before or after went, \n For I was safe with this same Dart. When wearie waxt mine arme \n With striking Deere, and that the day did make me somewhat warme, \n Withdrawing for to coole my selfe I sought among the shades \n For Aire that from the valleyes colde came breathing in at glades. \n The more excessive was my heate the more for Aire I sought. \n I waited for the gentle Aire: the Aire was that that brought \n Refreshing to my wearie limmes. And (well I bear't in thought) \n Come Aire I wonted was to sing, come ease the paine of me \n Within my bosom lodge thy selfe most welcome unto me, \n And as thou heretofore art wont abate my burning heate. \n By chaunce (such was my destinie) proceeding to repeate \n Mo words of daliance like to these, I used for to say \n Great pleasure doe I take in thee: for thou from day to day \n Doste both refresh and nourish me. Thou makest me delight \n In woods and solitarie grounds. Now would to God I might \n Receive continuall at my mouth this pleasant breath of thine. \n Some man (I wote not who) did heare these doubtfull words of mine, \n And taking them amisse supposde that this same name of Aire \n The which I callde so oft upon, had bene some Ladie faire: \n He thought that I had lovde some Nymph. And thereupon streight way \n He runnes me like a Harebrainde blab to Procris, to bewray \n This fault as he surmised it: and there with lavish tung \n Reported all the wanton words that he had heard me sung. \n A thing of light beliefe is love. She (as I since have harde) \n For sodeine sorrow swounded downe: and when long afterwarde \n She came againe unto hir selfe, she said she was accurst \n And borne to cruell destinie: and me she blamed wurst \n For breaking faith: and freating at a vaine surmised shame \n She dreaded that which nothing was: she fearde a headlesse name. \n She wist not what to say or thinke. The wretch did greatly feare \n Deceit: yet could she not beleve the tales that talked were. \n Onlesse she saw hir husbands fault apparant to hir eie, \n She thought she would not him condemne of any villanie. \n Next day as soone as Morning light had driven the night away, \n I went abrode to hunt againe: and speeding, as I lay \n Upon the grasse, I said: Come, Aire, and ease my painfull heate. \n And on the sodaine as I spake there seemed for to beate \n A certaine sighing in mine eares of what I could not gesse. \n But ceasing not for that I still proceeded nathelesse: \n And said, O come, most pleasant Aire. With that I heard a sound \n Of russling softly in the leaves that lay upon the ground. \n And thinking it had bene some beast I threw my flying Dart. \n It was my wife. Who being now sore wounded at the hart, \n Cride out, Alas. As soone as I perceyved by the shrieke \n It was my faithfull spouse, I ran me to the voiceward lieke \n A madman that had lost his wits. There found I hir halfe dead, \n Hir scattred garments staining in the bloud that she had bled, \n And (wretched creature as I am) yet drawing from the wound \n The gift that she hir selfe had given. Then softly from the ground \n I lifted up that bodie of hirs of which I was more chare \n Than of mine owne, and from hir brest hir clothes in hast I tare. \n And binding up hir cruell wound I strived for to stay \n The bloud, and prayd she would not thus by passing so away \n Forsake me as a murtherer: she waxing weake at length \n And drawing to hir death apace, enforced all hir strength \n To utter these few wordes at last: I pray thee humbly by \n Our bond of wedlocke, by the Gods as well above the Skie \n As those to whome I now must passe, as ever I have ought \n Deserved well by thee, and by the Love which having brought \n Me to my death doth even in death unfaded still remaine, \n To nestle in thy bed and mine let never Aire obtaine. \n This sed, she held hir peace, and I perceyved by the same \n And tolde hir also how she was beguiled in the name. \n But what avayled telling then? she quoathde: and with hir bloud \n Hir little strength did fade. Howbeit as long as that she coud \n See ought, she stared in my face and gasping still on me \n Even in my mouth she breathed forth hir wretched ghost. But she \n Did seeme with better cheare to die for that hir conscience was \n Discharged quight and cleare of doubtes. Now in conclusion as \n Duke Cephal weeping told this tale to Phocus and the rest \n Whose eyes were also moyst with teares to heare the pitious gest, \n Behold King Aeacus and with him his eldest sonnes both twaine \n Did enter in and after them there followed in a traine \n Of well appointed men of warre new levied: which the King \n Delivered unto Cephalus to Athens towne to bring. \n"

In that while King Minos with his fleete \n Did waste the cost of Megara . And first he thought it meete \n To make a triall of the force and courage of his men \n Against the towne Alcathoe where Nisus reigned then. \n Among whose honorable haire that was of colour gray, \n One scarlet haire did grow upon his crowne, whereon the stay \n Of all his Kingdome did depende. Sixe times did Phoebe fill \n Hir homes with borrowed light, and yet the warre hung wavering still \n In fickle fortunes doubtfull scaales: and long with fleeting wings \n Betwene them both flew victorie. A Turret of the Kings \n Stood hard adjoyning to the Wall which being touched rings, \n For Phoebus (so men say) did lay his golden Violl there, \n And so the stones the sound thereof did ever after beare. \n King Nisus daughter oftentimes resorted to this Wall \n And strake it with a little stone to raise the sound withall, \n In time of peace. And in the warre she many a time and oft \n Behelde the sturdie stormes of Mars from that same place aloft. \n And by continuance of the siege the Captaines names she knew, \n Their armes, horse, armor and aray in everie band and crew. \n Bit specially above the rest she noted Minos face. \n She knew inough and more than was inough as stoode the case. \n For were it that he hid his head in Helme with fethered crest, \n To hir opinion in his Helme he stayned all the rest. \n Or were it that he tooke in hand of steele his target bright, \n She thought in weelding of his shielde he was a comly Knight. \n Or were it that he raisde his arme to throw the piercing Dart, \n The Ladie did commend his force and manhode joynde with Art. \n Or drew he with his arrow nockt his bended Bow in hand \n She sware that so in all respectes was Phoebus wont to stand. \n But when he shewde his visage bare, his Helmet laid aside, \n And on a Milke white Steede brave trapt, in Purple Robe did ride, \n She scarce was Mistresse of hir selfe, hir wits were almost straught. \n A happie Dart she thought it was that he in fingars caught, \n And happie called she those reynes that he in hand had raught. \n And if she might have had hir will, she could have founde in hart, \n Among the enmies to have gone. She could have found in hart, \n From downe the highest Turret there hir bodie to have throwne, \n Among the thickest of the Tents of Gnossus to have flowne, \n Or for to ope the brazen gates and let the enmie in, \n Or whatsoever else she thought might Minos favor win. \n And as she sate beholding still the King of Candies tent, \n She said: I doubt me whether that I rather may lament \n Or of this wofull warre be glad. It grieves me at the hart \n That thou O Minos unto me thy Lover enmie art. \n But had not this same warfare bene, I never had him knowne. \n Yet might he leave this cruell warre, and take me as his owne. \n A wife, a feere, a pledge for peace he might receive of me. \n O flowre of beautie, O thou Prince most pearlesse: if that she \n That bare thee in hir wombe were like in beautie unto thee, \n A right good cause had Jove on hir enamored for to bee. \n Oh happie were I if with wings I through the Aire might glide \n And safely to King Minos Tent from this same Turret slide. \n Then would I utter who I am, and how the firie flame \n Of Cupid burned in my brest, desiring him to name \n What dowrie he would aske with me in loan of his love, \n Save only of my Fathers Realme no question he should move. \n For rather than by traitrous meanes my purpose should take place, \n Adue, desire of hoped Love. Yet oftentimes such grace \n Hath from the gentle Conqueror proceeded erst, that they \n Which tooke the foyle have found the same their profit and their stay. \n Assuredly the warre is just that Minos takes in hand, \n As in revengement of his sonne late murthered in this land. \n And as his quarrell seemeth just, even so it cannot faile, \n But rightfull warre against the wrong must (I beleve) prevaile. \n Now if this Citie in the ende must needes be taken, why \n Should his owne sworde and not my Love be meanes to win it by? \n It were yet better he should speede by gentle meanes without \n The slaughter of his people, yea and (as it may fall out) \n With spending of his owne bloud too. For sure I have a care \n O Minos lest some Souldier wound thee ere he be aware. \n For who is he in all the world that hath so hard a hart \n That wittingly against thy head would aime his cruell Dart? \n I like well this devise, and on this purpose will I stand: \n To yeelde my selfe endowed with this Citie to the hand \n Of Minos: and in doing so to bring this warre to ende. \n But smally it availeth me the matter to intende. \n The gates and yssues of this towne are kept with watch and warde, \n And of the Keyes continually my Father hath the garde. \n My Father only is the man of whome I stand in dreede, \n My Father only hindreth me of my desired speede. \n Would God that I were Fatherlesse. Tush, everie Wight may bee \n A God as in their owne behalfe, and if their hearts be free \n From fearefulnesse. For fortune works against the fond desire \n Of such as through faint heartednesse attempt not to aspire. \n Some other feeling in hir heart such flames of Cupids fire \n Already would have put in proofe some practise to destroy \n What thing so ever of hir Love the furtherance might anoy \n And why should any woman have a bolder heart than I? \n Through fire and sword I boldly durst adventure for to flie. \n And yet in this behalfe at all there needes no sword nor fire, \n There needeth but my fathers haire to accomplish my desire.

And as these words she spake, \n The cursed gift with wicked hand she profered him to take. \n But Minos did abhorre hir gift: and troubled in his minde \n With straungenesse of the heynous act so sore against hir kinde, \n He aunswerde: O thou slaunder of our age, the Gods expell \n Thee out of all this world of theirs and let thee no where dwell. \n Let rest on neither Sea nor Land be graunted unto thee. \n Assure thy selfe that as for me I never will agree \n That Candie, Joves owne foster place (as long as I there raigne), \n Shall unto such a monstruous Wight a Harbrow place remaine. \n This said, he like a righteous Judge among his vanquisht foes \n Set order under paine of death. Which done he willed those \n That served him to go aboorde and Anchors up to wey. \n When Scylla saw the Candian fleete aflote to go away, \n And that the Captaine yeelded not so good reward as shee \n Had for hir lewdnesse looked for: and when in fine she see \n That no entreatance could prevaile, then bursting out in ire \n With stretched hands and scattred haire, as furious as the fire \n She shraming cryed out aloud: And whither doste thou flie \n Rejecting me, the only meanes that thou hast conquerde by? \n O cankerde Churle preferde before my native soyle, preferd \n Before my father, whither flyste, O Carle of heart most hard? \n Whose conquest as it is my sinne, so doth it well deserve \n Reward of thee, for that my fault so well thy turne did serve. \n Doth neither thee the gift I gave, nor yet my faithfull love, \n Nor yet that all my hope on thee alonly rested, move? \n For whither shall I now resort forsaken thus of thee? \n To Megara the wretched soyle of my nativitie? \n Behold it lieth vanquished and troden under foote. \n But put the case it flourisht still: yet could it nothing boote. \n I have foreclosde it to my selfe through treason when I gave \n My fathers head to thee. Whereby my countriefolke I drave \n To hate me justly for my crime. And all the Realmes about \n My lewde example doe abhorre. Thus have I shet me out \n Of all the world that only Crete might take me in, which if \n Thou like a Churle denie, and cast me up without relief, \n The Ladie Europ surely was not mother unto thee: \n But one of Affricke Sirts where none but Serpents fostred bee, \n But even some cruell Tiger bred in Armen or in Inde , \n Or else the Gulfe Charybdis raisde with rage of Southerne winde. \n Thou wert not got by Jove: ne yet thy mother was beguilde \n In shape of Bull: of this thy birth the tale is false compilde. \n But rather some unwieldie Bull even altogither wilde \n That never lowed after Cow was out of doubt thy Sire. \n O father Nisus, put thou me to penance for my hire. \n Rejoyce thou in my punishment, thou towne by me betrayd. \n I have deserved (I confesse) most justly to be payd \n With death. But let some one of them that through my lewdnesse smart \n Destroy me, why doste thou that by my crime a gainer art, \n Commit like crime thy selfe? Admit this wicked act of me \n As to my land and Fatherward in deede most hainous be. \n Yet oughtest thou to take it as a friendship unto thee. \n But she was meete to be thy wife, that in a Cow of tree \n Could play the Harlot with a Bull, and in hir wombe could beare \n A Barne, in whome the shapes of man and beasts confounded were. \n How sayst thou, Carle? compell not these my words thine eares to glow? \n Or doe the windes that drive thy shyps, in vaine my sayings blow? \n In faith it is no wonder though thy wife Pasiphae \n Preferrde a Bull to thee, for thou more cruell wert than he. \n Now wo is me. To make more hast it standeth me in hand. \n The water sounds with Ores, and hales from me and from my land. \n In vaine thou striveth, O thou Churle, forgetfull quight of my \n Desertes: for even in spight of thee pursue thee still will I. \n Upon thy courbed Keele will I take holde: and hanging so \n Be drawen along the Sea with thee where ever thou do go. \n She scarce had said these words, but that she leaped on the wave \n And getting to the ships by force of strength that Love hir gave \n Upon the King of Candies Keele in spight of him she clave. \n Whome when hir father spide (for now he hovered in the aire, \n And being made a Hobby Hauke did soare between a paire \n Of nimble wings of yron Mayle) he soused downe amaine \n To seaze upon hir as she hung, and would have tome hir faine \n With bowing Beake. But she for feare did let the Caricke go: \n And as she was about to fall, the lightsome Aire did so \n Uphold hir that she could not touch the Sea as seemed tho. \n Anon all fethers she became, and forth away did flie \n Transformed to a pretie Bird that stieth to the Skie. \n And for bicause like clipped haire hir head doth beare a marke, \n The Greekes it Cyris call, and we doe name the same a Larke. \n\n \n",
            "2":"\n\n As soone as Minos came aland in Crete , he by and by \n Performde his vowes to Jupiter in causing for to die \n A hundred Bulles for sacrifice. And then he did adorne \n His Pallace with the enmies spoyles by conquest wonne beforne. \n The slaunder of his house encreast: and now appeared more \n The mothers filthie whoredome by the monster that she bore \n Of double shape, an ugly thing. This shamefull infamie, \n This monster borne him by his wife he mindes by pollicie \n To put away, and in a house with many nookes and krinks \n From all mens sights and speach of folke to shet it up he thinks. \n Immediatly one Daedalus renowmed in that lande \n For fine devise and workmanship in building, went in hand \n To make it. He confounds his worke with sodaine stops and stayes, \n And with the great uncertaintie of sundrie winding wayes \n Leades in and out, and to and fro, at divers doores astray. \n And as with trickling streame the Brooke Maeander seemes to play \n In Phrygia , and with doubtfull race runnes counter to and fro, \n And meeting with himselfe doth looke if all his streame or no \n Come after, and retiring eft cleane backward to his spring \n And marching eft to open Sea as streight as any string, \n Indenteth with reversed streame: even so of winding wayes \n Unnumerable Daedalus within his worke convayes. \n Yea scarce himselfe could find the meanes to winde himselfe well out: \n So busie and so intricate the house was all about. \n Within this Maze did Minos shet the Monster that did beare \n The shape of man and Bull. And when he twise had fed him there \n With bloud of Atticke Princes sonnes that given for tribute were, \n The third time at the ninth yeares end the lot did chaunce to light \n On Theseus, King Aegaeus sonne: who like a valiant Knight \n Did overcome the Minotaur: and by the pollicie \n Of Minos eldest daughter (who had taught him for to tie \n A clew of Linnen at the doore to guide himselfe thereby) \n As busie as the turnings were, his way he out did finde, \n Which never man had done before. And streight he having winde, \n With Minos daughter sailde away to Dia: where (unkinde \n And cruell creature that he was) he left hir post alone \n Upon the shore. Thus desolate and making dolefull mone \n God Bacchus did both comfort hir and take hir to his bed. \n And with an everlasting starre the more hir fame to spred, \n He tooke the Chaplet from hir head, and up to Heaven it threw. \n The Chaplet thirled through the Aire: and as it gliding flew, \n The precious stones were turnd to starres which biased cleare and bright, \n And tooke their place (continuing like a Chaplet still to sight) \n Amid betweene the Kneeler Downe and him that gripes the Snake.\n\n \n",
            "3":"\n\n Now in this while gan Daedalus a wearinesse to take \n Of living like a banisht man and prisoner such a time \n In Crete , and longed in his heart to see his native Clime. \n But Seas enclosed him as if he had in prison be. \n Then thought he: though both Sea and Land King Minos stop fro me, \n I am assurde he cannot stop the Aire and open Skie. \n To make my passage that way then my cunning will I trie. \n Although that Minos like a Lord held all the world beside: \n Yet doth the Aire from Minos yoke for all men free abide. \n This sed: to uncoth Arts he bent the force of all his wits \n To alter natures course by craft. And orderly he knits \n A rowe of fethers one by one, beginning with the short, \n And overmatching still eche quill with one of longer sort, \n That on the shoring of a hill a man would thinke them grow. \n Even so the countrie Organpipes of Oten reedes ir row \n Ech higher than another rise. Then fastned he with Flax \n The middle quilles, and joyned in the lowest sort with Wax. \n And when he thus had finisht them, a little he them bent \n In compasse, that the verie Birdes they full might represent. \n There stoode me by him Icarus, his sonne, a pretie Lad. \n Who knowing not that he in handes his owne destruction had, \n With smiling mouth did one while blow the fethers to and fro \n Which in the Aire on wings of Birds did flask not long ago: \n And with his thumbes another while he chafes the yelow Wax \n And lets his fathers wondrous worke with childish toyes and knacks. \n As soon as that the worke was done, the workman by and by \n Did peyse his bodie on his wings, and in the Aire on hie \n Hung wavering: and did teach his sonne how he should also flie. \n I warne thee (quoth he), Icarus, a middle race to keepe. \n For if thou hold too low a gate, the dankenesse of the deepe \n Will overlade thy wings with wet. And if thou mount too hie, \n The Sunne will sindge them. Therfore see betweene them both thou flie. \n I bid thee not behold the Starre Bootes in the Skie. \n Nor looke upon the bigger Beare to make thy course thereby, \n Nor yet on Orions naked sword. But ever have an eie \n To keepe the race that I doe keepe, and I will guide thee right. \n In giving counsell to his sonne to order well his flight, \n He fastned to his shoulders twaine a paire of uncoth wings. \n And as he was in doing it and warning him of things, \n His aged cheekes were wet, his hands did quake, in fine he gave \n His sonne a kisse the last that he alive should ever have. \n And then he mounting up aloft before him tooke his way \n Right fearfull for his followers sake: as is the Bird the day \n That first she tolleth from hir nest among the braunches hie \n Hir tender yong ones in the Aire to teach them for to flie. \n So heartens he his little sonne to follow teaching him \n A hurtfull Art. His owne two wings he waveth verie trim, \n And looketh backward still upon his sonnes. The fishermen \n Then standing angling by the Sea, and shepeherdes leaning then \n On sheepehookes, and the Ploughmen on the handles of their Plough, \n Beholding them, amazed were: and thought that they that through \n The Aire could flie were Gods. And now did on their left side stand \n The Iles of Paros and of Dele and Samos , Junos land: \n And on their right, Lebinthos and the faire Calydna fraught \n With store of honie: when the Boy a frolicke courage caught \n To flie at randon. Whereupon forsaking quight his guide, \n Of fond desire to flie to Heaven, above his boundes he stide. \n And there the nerenesse of the Sunne which burnd more hote aloft, \n Did make the Wax (with which his wings were glewed) lithe and soft. \n As soone as that the Wax was molt, his naked armes he shakes, \n And wanting wherewithall to wave no helpe of Aire he takes. \n But calling on his father loud he drowned in the wave: \n And by this chaunce of his those Seas his name for ever have. \n His wretched Father (but as then no father) cride in feare: \n O Icarus, O Icarus, where art thou? tell me where \n That I may finde thee, Icarus. He saw the fethers swim \n Upon the waves, and curst his Art that so had spighted him. \n At last he tooke his bodie up and laid it in a grave, \n And to the Ile the name of him then buried in it gave. \n And as he of his wretched sonne the corse in ground did hide, \n The cackling Partrich from a thicke and leavie thorne him spide, \n And clapping with his wings for joy aloud to call began. \n There was of that same kinde of Birde no mo but he as than. \n In times forepast had none bene seene. It was but late anew \n Since he was made a bird: and that thou, Daedalus, mayst rew: \n For whyle the world doth last thy shame shall thereupon ensew. \n For why thy sister, ignorant of that which after hapt, \n Did put him to thee to be taught full twelve yeares old and apt \n To take instruction. He did marke the middle bone that goes \n Through fishes, and according to the paterne tane of those \n He filed teeth upon a piece of yron one by one \n And so devised first the Saw where erst was never none. \n Moreover he two yron shankes so joynde in one round head, \n That opening an indifferent space, the one point downe shall tread, \n And tother draw a circle round. The finding of these things, \n The spightfull heart of Daedalus with such a m lice stings, \n That headlong from the holy towre of Pallas downe he thrue \n His Nephew, feyning him to fall by chaunce, which was not true. \n But Pallas (who doth favour wits) did stay him in his fall \n And chaunging him into a Bird did clad him over all \n With fethers soft amid the Aire. The quicknesse of his wit \n (Which erst was swift) did shed it selfe among his wings and feete. \n And as he Partrich hight before, so hights he Partrich still. \n Yet mounteth not this Bird aloft ne seemes to have a will \n To build hir nest in tops of trees among the boughes on hie \n But flecketh nere the ground and layes hir egges in hedges drie. \n And forbicause hir former fall she ay in minde doth beare, \n She ever since all lofty things doth warely shun for feare.\n\n \n",
            "4":"\n\n And now forwearied Daedalus alighted in the land \n Within the which the burning hilles of firie Aetna stand. \n To save whose life King Cocalus did weapon take in hand, \n For which men thought him merciful. And now with high renowne \n Had Theseus ceast the wofull pay of tribute in the towne \n Of Athens . Temples decked were with garlands every where, \n And supplications made to Jove and warlicke Pallas were, \n And all the other Gods, to whome more honor for to show, \n Gifts, blud of beasts, and frankincense the people did bestow \n As in performance of their vowes. The right redoubted name \n Of Theseus through the lande of Greece was spred by flying fame. \n And now the folke that in the land of rich Achaia dwelt, \n Praid him of succor in the harmes and perils that they felt. \n Although the land of Calydon had then Meleager: \n Yet was it faine in humble wise to Theseus to prefer \n A supplication for the aide of him. The cause wherfore \n They made such humble suit to him was this. There was a Bore \n The which Diana for to wreake hir wrath conceyvde before \n Had thither as hir servant sent the countrie for to waast. \n For men report that Oenie when he had in storehouse plaast \n The full encrease of former yeare, to Ceres did assigne \n The firstlings of his corne and fruits: to Bacchus, of the Wine: \n And unto Pallas Olife oyle. This honoring of the Gods \n Of graine and fruits who put their help to toyling in the clods, \n Ambitiously to all, even those that dwell in heaven did clime. \n Dianas Altars (as it hapt) alonly at that time \n Without reward of Frankincense were overskipt (they say). \n Even Gods are subject unto wrath. He shall not scape away \n Unpunisht, though unworshipped he passed me wyth spight: \n He shall not make his vaunt he scapt me unrevenged quight, \n Quoth Phoebe. And anon she sent a Bore to Oenies ground \n Of such a hugenesse as no Bull could ever yet be found, \n In Epyre: but in Sicilie are Bulles much lesse than hee. \n His eies did glister blud and fire: right dreadfull was to see \n His brawned necke, right dredfull was his haire which grew as thicke \n With pricking points as one of them could well by other sticke. \n And like a front of armed Pikes set close in battell ray \n The sturdie bristles on his back stoode staring up alway. \n The scalding fome with gnashing hoarse which he did cast aside, \n Upon his large and brawned shield did white as Curdes abide. \n Among the greatest Oliphants in all the land of Inde , \n A greater tush than had this Boare, ye shall not lightly finde. \n Such lightning flashed from his chappes, as seared up the grasse. \n Now trampled he the spindling come to ground where he did passe, \n Now ramping up their riped hope he made the Plowmen weepe. \n And chankt the kernell in the eare. In vaine their floores they sweepe: \n In vaine their Barnes for Harvest long, the likely store they keepe. \n The spreaded Vines with clustred Grapes to ground he rudely sent, \n And full of Berries loden boughes from Olife trees he rent. \n On cattell also did he rage. The shepeherd nor his dog, \n Nor yet the Bulles could save the herdes from outrage of this Hog. \n The folke themselves were faine to flie. And yet they thought them not \n In safetie when they had themselves within the Citie got. \n Untill their Prince Meleager, and with their Prince a knot \n Of Lords and lustie gentlemen of hand and courage stout, \n With chosen fellowes for the nonce of all the Lands about, \n Inflamed were to win renowne. The chiefe that thither came \n Were both the twinnes of Tyndarus of great renowne and fame, \n The one in all activitie of manhode, strength and force, \n The other for his cunning skill in handling of a horse. \n And Jason he that first of all the Gallie did invent: \n And Theseus with Pirithous betwene which two there went \n A happie leage of amitie: And two of Thesties race: \n And Lynce, the sonne of Apharie and Idas, swift of pace. \n And fierce Leucyppus and the brave Acastus with his Dart \n In handling of the which he had the perfect skill and Art. \n And Caeny who by birth a wench, the shape of man had wonne \n And Drias and Hippothous: and Phoenix eke the sonne \n Of olde Amyntor: and a paire of Actors ympes: and Phyle \n Who came from Elis . Telamon was also there that while: \n And so was also Peleus, the great Achilles Sire: \n And Pherets sonne: and Iolay, the Thebane who with fire \n Helpt Hercules the monstruous heades of Hydra off to seare. \n The lively Lad Eurytion and Echion who did beare \n The pricke and prise for footemanship, were present also there. \n And Lelex of Narytium too. And Panopie beside: \n And Hyle: and cruell Hippasus: and Naestor who that tide \n Was in the Prime of lustie youth: moreover thither went \n Three children of Hippocoon from old Amicle sent. \n And he that of Penelope the fathrinlaw became. \n And eke the sonne of Parrhasus, Ancaeus cald by name. \n There was the sonne of Ampycus of great forecasting wit: \n And Oeclies sonne who of his wife was unbetrayed yit. \n And from the Citie Tegea there came the Paragone \n Of Lycey forrest, Atalant, a goodly Ladie, one \n Of Schoenyes daughters, then a Maide. The garment she did weare \n A brayded button fastned at hir gorget. All hir heare \n Untrimmed in one only knot was trussed. From hir left \n Side hanging on hir shoulder was an Ivorie quiver deft: \n Which being full of arrowes, made a clattring as she went. \n And in hir right hand she did beare a Bow already bent. \n Hir furniture was such as this. Hir countnance and hir grace \n Was such as in a Boy might well be cald a Wenches face, \n And in a Wench be cald a Boyes. The Prince of Calydon \n No sooner cast his eie on hir, but being caught anon \n In love, he wisht hir to his wife. But unto this desire \n God Cupid gave not his consent. The secret flames of fire \n He haling inward still did say: O happy man is he \n Whom this same Ladie shall vouchsave hir Husband for to be. \n The shortnesse of the time and shame would give him leave to say \n No more: a worke of greater weight did draw him then away. \n A wood thick growen with trees which stoode unfelled to that day \n Beginning from a plaine, had thence a large prospect throughout \n The falling grounds that every way did muster round about. \n As soone as that the men came there, some pitched up the toyles, \n Some tooke the couples from the Dogs, and some pursude the foyles \n In places where the Swine had tract: desiring for to spie \n Their owne destruction. Now there was a hollow bottom by, \n To which the watershots of raine from all the high grounds drew. \n Within the compasse of this pond great store of Osiers grew: \n And Sallowes lithe, and flackring Flags, and moorish Rushes eke, \n And lazie Reedes on little shankes, and other baggage like. \n From hence the Bore was rowzed out, and fiersly forth he flies \n Among the thickest of his foes like thunder from the Skies, \n When Clouds in meeting force the fire to burst by violence out. \n He beares the trees before him downe, and all the wood about \n Doth sound of crashing. All the youth with hideous noyse and shout \n Against him bend their Boarspeare points with hand and courage stout. \n He rushes forth among the Dogs that held him at a bay, \n And now on this side now on that, as any come in way, \n He rippes their skinnes and splitteth them, and chaseth them away, \n Echion first of all the rout a Dart at him did throw, \n Which mist and in a Maple tree did give a little blow. \n The next (if he that threw the same had used lesser might), \n The backe at which he aimed it was likely for to smight. \n It overflew him. Jason was the man that cast the Dart. \n With that the sonne of Ampycus sayd: Phoebus (if with hart \n I have and still doe worship thee) now graunt me for to hit \n The thing that I doe levell at. Apollo graunts him it \n As much as lay in him to graunt. He hit the Swine in deede. \n But neyther entred he his hide nor caused him to bleede. \n For why Diana (as the Dart was flying) tooke away \n The head of it: and so the Dart could headlesse beare no sway. \n But yet the moodie beast thereby was set the more on fire \n And chafing like the lightning swift he uttreth forth his ire. \n The fire did sparkle from his eyes: and from his boyling brest \n He breathed flaming flakes of fire conceyved in his chest. \n And looke with what a violent brunt a mightie Bullet goes \n From engines bent against a wall, or bulwarks full of foes: \n With even such violence rusht the Swine among the Hunts amayne, \n And overthrew Eupalamon and Pelagon both twaine \n That in the right wing placed were. Their fellowes stepping to \n And drawing them away, did save their lives with much ado. \n But as for poore Enesimus, Hippocoons sonne had not \n The lucke to scape the deadly dint. He would away have got, \n And trembling turnde his backe for feare. The Swine him overtooke, \n And cut his hamstrings, so that streight his going him forsooke.\n\n \n",
            "5":"\n\n And Naestor to have lost his life was like by fortune ere \n The siege of Troie , but that he tooke his rist upon his speare: \n And leaping quickly up upon a tree that stoode hard by, \n Did safely from the place behold his foe whome he did flie. \n The Boare then whetting sharpe his tuskes against the Oken wood \n To mischiefe did prepare himselfe with fierce and cruell mood. \n And trusting to his weapons which he sharpened had anew, \n In great Orithyas thigh a wound with hooked groyne he drew. \n The valiant brothers, those same twinnes of Tyndarus (not yet \n Celestiall signes), did both of them on goodly coursers sit \n As white as snow: and ech of them had shaking in his fist \n A lightsome Dart with head of steele to throw it where he lyst. \n And for to wound the bristled Bore they surely had not mist \n But that he still recovered so the coverts of the wood, \n That neyther horse could follow him, nor Dart doe any good. \n Still after followed Telamon, whom taking to his feete \n No heede at all for egernesse, a Maple roote did meete, \n Which tripped up his heeles, and flat against the ground him laid. \n And while his brother Peleus relieved him, the Maid \n Of Tegea tooke an arrow swift, and shot it from hir bow. \n The arrow lighting underneath the havers eare bylow, \n And somewhat rasing of the skin, did make the bloud to show. \n The Maid hirselfe not gladder was to see that luckie blow, \n Than was the Prince Meleager. He was the first that saw, \n And first that shewed to his Mates the blud that she did draw: \n And said: For this thy valiant act due honor shalt thou have. \n The men did blush, and chearing up ech other courage gave \n With shouting, and disorderly their Darts by heaps they threw. \n The number of them hindred them, not suffring to ensew \n That any lighted on the marke at which they all did ame. \n Behold, enragde against his ende the hardie Knight that came \n From Arcadie , rusht rashly with a Pollax in his fist \n And said: You yonglings learne of me what difference is betwist \n A wenches weapons and a mans: and all of you give place \n To my redoubted force. For though Diana in this chase \n Should with hir owne shield him defend, yet should this hand of mine \n Even maugre Dame Dianas heart confound this orped Swine. \n Such boasting words as these through pride presumptuously he crakes: \n And streyning out himselfe upon his tiptoes streight he takes \n His Pollax up with both his hands. But as this bragger ment \n To fetch his blow, the cruell beast his malice did prevent: \n And in his coddes (the speeding place of death) his tusshes puts, \n And rippeth up his paunche. Downe falles Ancaeus and his guts \n Come tumbling out besmearde with bloud, and foyled all the plot. \n Pirithous, Ixions sonne, at that abashed not: \n But shaking in his valiant hand his hunting staffe did goe \n Still stoutly forward face to face t'encounter with his foe \n To whome Duke Theseus cride afarre: O dearer unto mee \n Than is my selfe, my soule I say, stay: lawfull we it see \n For valiant men to keepe aloofe. The over hardie hart \n In rash adventring of him selfe hath made Ancaeus smart. \n This sed, he threw a weightie Dart of Cornell with a head \n Of brasse: which being leveld well was likely to have sped, \n But that a bough of Chestnut tree thick leaved by the way \n Did latch it, and by meanes therof the dint of it did stay. \n Another Dart that Jason threw, by fortune mist the Bore, \n And light betwene a Mastifes chaps, and through his guts did gore, \n And naild him to the earth. The hand of Prince Meleager \n Plaid hittymissie. Of two Darts his first did flie too far, \n And lighted in the ground: the next amid his backe stickt fast. \n And while the Bore did play the fiend and turned round agast, \n And grunting flang his fome about togither mixt with blood, \n The giver of the wound (the more to stirre his enmies mood,) \n Stept in, and underneath the shield did thrust his Boarspeare through. \n Then all the Hunters shouting out demeaned joy inough. \n And glad was he that first might come to take him by the hand. \n About the ugly beast they all with gladnesse gazing stand \n And wondring what a field of ground his carcasse did possesse, \n There durst not any be so bolde to touch him. Nerethelesse, \n They every of them with his bloud their hunting staves made red. \n Then stepped forth Meleager, and treading on his hed \n Said thus: O Ladie Atalant, receive thou here my fee, \n And of my glorie vouch thou safe partaker for to bee. \n Immediatly the ugly head with both the tusshes brave \n And eke the skin with bristles stur right griesly, he hir gave. \n The Ladie for the givers sake, was in hir heart as glad \n As for the gift. The rest repinde that she such honor had. \n Through all the rout was murmuring. Of whom with roring reare \n And armes displayd that all the field might easly see and heare, \n The Thesties cried: Dame, come off and lay us downe this geare. \n And thou a woman offer not us men so great a shame, \n As we to toyle and thou to take the honor of our game. \n Ne let that faire smooth face of thine beguile thee, lest that hee \n That being doted in thy love did give thee this our fee, \n Be over farre to rescow thee. And with that word they tooke \n The gift from hir, and right of gift from him. He could not brooke \n This wrong: but gnashing with his teeth for anger that did boyle \n Within, said fiersly: learne ye you that other folkes dispoyle \n Of honor given, what diffrence is betweene your threats, and deedes. \n And therewithall Plexippus brest (who no such matter dreedes) \n With wicked weapon he did pierce. As Toxey doubting stood \n What way to take, desiring both t'advenge his brothers blood, \n And fearing to be murthered as his brother was before, \n Meleager (to dispatch all doubts of musing any more) \n Did heate his sword for companie in bloud of him againe, \n Before Plexippus bloud was cold that did thereon remaine. \n Althaea going toward Church with presents for to yild \n Due thankes and worship to the Gods that for hir sonne had kild \n The Boare, beheld hir brothers brought home dead: and by and by \n She beate hir brest, and filde the towne with shrieking piteously, \n And shifting all hir rich aray, did put on mourning weede \n But when she understoode what man was doer of the deede, \n She left all mourning, and from teares to vengeance did proceede.\n\n \n",
            "6":"\n\n There was a certaine firebrand which when Oenies wife did lie \n In childebed of Meleager, she chaunced to espie \n The Destnies putting in the fire: and in the putting in, \n She heard them speake these words, as they his fatall threede did spin: \n O lately borne, like time we give to thee and to this brand. \n And when they so had spoken, they departed out of hand. \n Immediatly the mother caught the blazing bough away, \n And quenched it. This bough she kept full charely many a day: \n And in the keeping of the same she kept hir sonne alive. \n But now intending of his life him clearly to deprive, \n She brought it forth, and causing all the coales and shivers to \n Be layed by, she like a foe did kindle fire thereto. \n Fowre times she was about to cast the firebrand in the flame: \n Fowre times she pulled backe hir hand from doing of the same. \n As mother and as sister both she strove what way to go: \n The divers names drew diversly hir stomacke to and fro. \n Hir face waxt often pale for feare of mischiefe to ensue: \n And often red about the eies through heate of ire she grew. \n One while hir looke resembled one that threatned cruelnesse: \n Another while ye would have thought she minded pitiousnesse. \n And though the cruell burning of hir heart did drie hir teares, \n Yet burst out some. And as a Boate which tide contrarie beares \n Against the winde, feeles double force, and is compeld to yeelde \n To both, so Thesties daughter now unable for to weelde \n Hir doubtful passions, diversly is caried off and on, \n And chaungeably she waxes calme, and stormes againe anon. \n But better sister ginneth she than mother for to be. \n And to th'intent hir brothers ghostes with bloud to honor, she \n In meaning to be one way kinde, doth worke another way \n Against kinde. When the plagie fire waxt strong she thus did say: \n Let this same fire my bowels burne. And as in cursed hands \n The fatall wood she holding at the Hellish Altar stands: \n She said: Ye triple Goddesses of wreake, ye Helhounds three \n Beholde ye all this furious fact and sacrifice of mee. \n I wreake, and do against all right: with death must death be payde: \n In mischiefe mischiefe must be heapt: on corse must corse be laide. \n Confounded let this wicked house with heaped sorrowes bee. \n Shall Oenie joy his happy sonne in honor for to see \n And Thestie mourne bereft of his? Nay: better yet it were, \n That eche with other companie in mourning you should beare. \n Ye brothers Ghostes and soules new dead I wish no more, but you \n To feele the solemne obsequies which I prepare as now: \n And that mine offring you accept, which dearly I have bought \n The yssue of my wretched wombe. Alas, alas what thought \n I for to doe? O brothers, I besech you beare with me. \n I am his mother: so to doe my hands unable be. \n His trespasse I confesse deserves the stopping of his breath: \n But yet I doe not like that I be Author of his death. \n And shall he then with life and limme, and honor too, scape free? \n And vaunting in his good successe the King of Calidon bee? \n And you deare soules lie raked up but in a little dust? \n I will not surely suffer it. But let the villaine trust \n That he shall die, and draw with him to ruine and decay \n His Kingdome, Countrie and his Sire that doth upon him stay. \n Why where is now the mothers heart and pitie that should raigne \n In Parents? and the ten Monthes paines that once I did sustaine? \n O would to God thou burned had a babie in this brand, \n And that I had not tane it out and quencht it with my hand. \n That all this while thou lived hast, my goodnesse is the cause. \n And now most justly unto death thine owne desert thee drawes. \n Receive the guerdon of thy deede: and render thou agen \n Thy twice given life, by bearing first, and secondarly when \n I caught this firebrand from the flame: or else come deale with me \n As with my brothers, and with them let me entumbed be. \n I would, and cannot. What then shall I stand to in this case? \n One while my brothers corses seeme to prease before my face \n With lively Image of their deaths. Another while my minde \n Doth yeelde to pitie, and the name of mother doth me blinde. \n Now wo is me. To let you have the upper hand is sinne: \n But nerethelesse the upper hand O brothers doe you win. \n Condicionly that when that I to comfort you withall \n Have wrought this feate, my selfe to you resort in person shall. \n This sed, she turnde away hir face, and with a trembling hand \n Did cast the deathfull brand amid the burning fire. The brand \n Did eyther sigh, or seeme to sigh in burning in the flame, \n Which sorie and unwilling was to fasten on the same. \n Meleager being absent and not knowing ought at all \n Was burned with this flame: and felt his bowels to appall \n With secret fire. He bare out long the paine with courage stout. \n But yet it grieved him to die so cowardly without \n The shedding of his bloud. He thought Anceus for to be \n A happie man that dide of wound. With sighing called he \n Upon his aged father, and his sisters, and his brother, \n And lastly on his wife too, and by chaunce upon his mother. \n His paine encreased with the fire, and fell therewith againe: \n And at the selfe same instant quight extinguisht were both twaine. \n And as the ashes soft and hore by leysure overgrew \n The glowing coales: so leysurly his spirit from him drew. \n Then drouped stately Calydon. Both yong and olde did mourne, \n The Lords and Commons did lament, and maried wives with tome \n And tattred haire did crie alas. His father did beray \n His horie head and face with dust, and on the earth flat lay, \n Lamenting that he lived had to see that wofull day \n For now his mothers giltie hand had for that cursed crime \n Done execution on hir selfe by sword before hir time. \n If God to me a hundred mouthes with sounding tongues should send, \n And reason able to conceyve, and thereunto should lend \n Me all the grace of eloquence that ere the Muses had, \n I could not shew the wo wherewith his sisters were bestad. \n Unmindfull of their high estate, their naked brests they smit, \n Untill they made them blacke and blew. And while his bodie yit \n Remained, they did cherish it, and cherish it againe. \n They kist his bodie: yea they kist the chist that did containe \n His corse. And after that the corse was burnt to ashes, they \n Did presse his ashes with their brests: and downe along they lay \n Upon his tumb, and there embraste his name upon the stone, \n And filde the letters of the same with teares that from them gone. \n At length Diana satisfide with slaughter brought upon \n The house of Oenie, lifts them up with fethers everichone, \n (Save Gorgee and the daughtrinlaw of noble Alcmene) and \n Makes wings to stretch along their sides, and horned nebs to stand \n Upon their mouthes. And finally she altring quight their faire \n And native shape, in shape of Birds dooth sent them through the Aire. \n\n \n",
            "7":"\n\n The noble Theseus in this while with others having donne \n His part in killing of the Boare, to Athens ward begonne \n To take his way. But Acheloy then being swolne with raine \n Did stay him of his journey, and from passage him restraine. \n Of Athens valiant knight (quoth he) come underneath my roofe, \n And for to passe my raging streame as yet attempt no proofe. \n This brooke is wont whole trees to beare and evelong stones to carry \n With hideous roring down his streame. I oft have seene him harry \n Whole Shepcotes standing nere his banks, with flocks of sheepe therin. \n Nought booted buls their strength: nought steedes by swiftnes there could win. \n Yea many lustie men this brooke hath swallowed, when the snow \n From mountaines molten, caused him his banks to overflow. \n i The best is for you for to rest untill the River fall \n Within his boundes: and runne ageine within his chanell small. \n Content (quoth Theseus): Acheloy, I will not sure refuse \n Thy counsell nor thy house. And so he both of them did use. \n Of Pommy hollowed diversly and ragged Pebble stone \n The walles were made. The floore with Mosse was soft to tread upon. \n The roofe thereof was checkerwise with shelles of Purple wrought \n And Perle. The Sunne then full two parts of day to end had brought, \n And Theseus downe to table sate with such as late before \n Had friendly borne him companie at killing of the Bore. \n At one side sate Ixions sonne, and on the other sate \n The Prince of Troyzen, Lelex , with a thin hearde horie pate. \n And then such other as the brooke of Acarnania did \n Vouchsafe the honor to his boord and table for to bid, \n Who was right glad of such a guest. Immediatly there came \n Barefooted Nymphes who brought in meate. And when that of the same \n The Lords had taken their repast, the meate away they tooke, \n And set downe wine in precious stones. Then Theseus who did looke \n Upon the Sea that underneath did lie within their sight, \n Said: tell us what is yon same place, (and with his fingar right \n Hee poynted thereunto) I pray, and what that Iland hight, \n Although it seemeth mo than one. The River answerd thus, \n It is not one mayne land alone that kenned is of us. \n There are uppon a fyve of them. The distaunce of the place, \n Dooth hinder to discerne betweene eche Ile the perfect space. \n And that the lesse yee woonder may at Phoebees act alate, \n To such as had neglected her uppon contempt or hate, \n Theis Iles were sumtyme Waternimphes: who having killed Neate, \n Twyce fyve, and called to theyr feast the Country Gods to eate, \n Forgetting mee kept frolicke cheere. At that gan I to swell, \n And ran more large than ever erst, and being over fell \n In stomacke and in streame, I rent the wood from wood, and feeld \n From feeld, and with the ground the Nymphes as then with stomacks meeld \n Remembring mee, I tumbled to the Sea. The waves of mee \n And of the sea the ground that erst all whole was woont to bee \n Did rend asunder into all the Iles you yonder see, \n And made a way for waters now to passe betweene them free. \n They now of Urchins have theyr name. But of theis Ilands, one \n A great way off (behold yee) stands a great way off alone, \n As you may see. The Mariners doo call it Perimell. \n With her (shee was as then a Nymph) so farre in love I fell, \n That of her maydenhod I her spoyld: which thing displeasd so sore \n Her father Sir Hippodamas, that from the craggy shore \n He threw her headlong downe to drowne her in the sea. But I \n Did latch her streight, and bearing her aflote did lowd thus crie: \n O Neptune with thy threetynde Mace who hast by lot the charge \n Of all the waters wylde that bound uppon the earth at large, \n To whom wee holy streames doo runne, in whome wee take our end, \n Draw neere, and gently to my boone effectually attend. \n This Ladie whome I beare aflote myselfe hath hurt. Bee meeke \n And upright. If Hippodamas perchaunce were fatherleeke, \n Or if that he extremitie through outrage did not secke, \n He oughted to have pitied her and for to beare with mee. \n Now help us Neptune, I thee pray, and condescend that shee \n Whom from the land her fathers wrath and cruelnesse dooth chace \n Who through her fathers cruelnesse is drownd: may find the grace \n To have a place: or rather let hirselfe become a place. \n And I will still embrace the same. The King of Seas did move \n His head, and as a token that he did my sute approve, \n He made his surges all to shake. The Nymph was sore afrayd. \n Howbee't shee swam, and as she swam, my hand I softly layd \n Upon her brest which quivered still. And whyle I toucht the same, \n I sensibly did feele how all her body hard became: \n And how the earth did overgrow her bulk. And as I spake, \n New earth enclosde hir swimming limbes, which by and by did take \n Another shape, and grew into a mighty Ile.\n\n \n",
            "8":"\n\n With that \n The River ceast and all men there did woonder much thereat. \n Pirithous being over hault of mynde and such a one \n As did despyse bothe God and man, did laugh them everychone \n To scorne for giving credit, and sayd thus: The woords thou spaakst \n Are feyned fancies, Acheloy: and overstrong thou maakst \n The Gods: to say that they can give and take way shapes. This scoffe \n Did make the heerers all amazde, for none did like thereof. \n And Lelex of them all the man most rype in yeeres and wit, \n Sayd thus: Unmeasurable is the powre of heaven, and it \n Can have none end. And looke what God dooth mynd to bring about, \n Must take effect. And in this case to put yee out of dout, \n Upon the hilles of Phrygie neere a Teyle there stands a tree \n Of Oke enclosed with a wall. Myself the place did see. \n For Pithey untoo Pelops feelds did send mee where his father \n Did sumtyme reigne. Not farre fro thence there is a poole which rather \n Had bene dry ground inhabited. But now it is a meare \n And Moorecocks, Cootes, and Cormorants doo breede and nestle there. \n The mightie Jove and Mercurie his sonne in shape of men \n Resorted thither on a tyme. A thousand houses when \n For roome to lodge in they had sought, a thousand houses bard \n Theyr doores against them. Nerethelesse one Cotage afterward \n Receyved them, and that was but a pelting one in deede. \n The roofe therof was thatched all with straw and fennish reede. \n Howbee't two honest auncient folke, (of whom she Baucis hight \n And he Philemon) in that Cote theyr fayth in youth had plight: \n And in that Cote had spent theyr age. And for they paciently \n Did beare theyr simple povertie, they made it light thereby, \n And shewed it no thing to bee repyned at at all. \n It skilles not whether there for Hyndes or Maister you doo call, \n For all the houshold were but two: and both of them obeyde, \n And both commaunded. When the Gods at this same Cotage staid, \n And ducking downe their heads, within the low made Wicket came, \n Philemon bringing ech a stoole, bade rest upon the same \n Their limmes: and busie Baucis brought them cuishons homely geere. \n ihich done, the embers on the harth she gan abrode to steere, \n And laid the coales togither that were raakt up over night, \n And with the brands and dried leaves did make them gather might, \n And with the blowing of hir mouth did make them kindle bright. \n Then from an inner house she fetcht seare sticks and clifted brands, \n And put them broken underneath a Skillet with hir hands. \n Hir Husband from their Gardenplot fetcht Coleworts. Of the which \n She shreaded small the leaves, and with a Forke tooke downe a flitch \n Of restie Bacon from the Balke made blacke with smoke, and cut \n A peece thereof, and in the pan to boyling did it put. \n And while this meate a seething was, the time in talke they spent, \n By meanes whereof away without much tedousnesse it went. \n There hung a Boawle of Beeche upon a spirget by a ring. \n The same with warmed water filld the two old folke did bring \n To bathe their guests foule feete therein. Amid the house there stood \n A Couch whose bottom sides and feete were all of Sallow wood, \n And on the same a Mat of Sedge. They cast upon this bed \n A covering which was never wont upon it to be spred \n Except it were at solemne feastes: and yet the same was olde \n And of the coursest, with a bed of sallow meete to holde. \n The Gods sate downe. The aged wife right chare and busie as \n A Bee, set out a table, of the which the thirde foote was \n A little shorter than the rest. A tylesherd made it even \n And tooke away the shoringnesse: and when they had it driven \n To stand up levell, with greene Mintes they by and by it wipte. \n Then set they on it Pallas fruite with double colour stripte. \n And Cornels kept in pickle moyst, and Endive, and a roote \n Of Radish, and a jolly lump of Butter fresh and soote, \n And Egges reare rosted. All these Cates in earthen dishes came. \n Then set they downe a graven cup made also of the same \n Selfe kinde of Plate, and Mazers made of Beech whose inner syde \n Was rubd with yellow wax. And when they pawsed had a tyde, \n Hot meate came pyping from the fyre. And shortly thereupon \n A cup of greene hedg wyne was brought. This tane away, anon \n Came in the latter course, which was of Nuts, Dates, dryed figges, \n Sweete smelling Apples in a Mawnd made flat of Osier twigges, \n And Prunes and Plums and Purple grapes cut newly from the tree, \n And in the middes a honnycomb new taken from the Bee. \n Besydes all this there did ensew good countnance overmore, \n With will not poore nor nigardly. Now all the whyle before, \n As ofen as Philemon and Dame Baucis did perceyve \n The emptie Cup to fill alone, and wyne to still receyve, \n Amazed at the straungenesse of the thing, they gan streyght way \n With fearfull harts and hands hilld up to frame themselves to pray. \n Desyring for theyr slender cheere and fare to pardoned bee. \n They had but one poore Goose which kept theyr little Tennantree, \n And this to offer to the Gods theyr guestes they did intend. \n The Gander wyght of wing did make the slow old folke to spend \n Theyr paynes in vayne, and mokt them long. At length he seemd to flye \n For succor to the Gods themselves, who bade he should not dye. \n For wee bee Gods (quoth they) and all this wicked towneship shall \n Abye their gylt. On you alone this mischeef shall not fall. \n No more but give you up your house, and follow up this hill \n Togither, and upon the top therof abyde our will. \n They bothe obeyd. And as the Gods did lead the way before, \n They lagged slowly after with theyr staves, and labored sore \n Ageinst the rysing of the hill. They were not mickle more \n Than full a flyghtshot from the top, when looking backe they saw \n How all the towne was drowned save their lyttle shed of straw. \n And as they wondred at the thing and did bewayle the case \n Of those that had theyr neyghbours beene, the old poore Cote so base \n Whereof they had beene owners erst, became a Church. The proppes \n Were turned into pillars huge. The straw uppon the toppes \n Was yellow, so that all the roof did seeme of burnisht gold: \n The floore with Marble paved was. The doores on eyther fold \n Were graven. At the sight hereof Philemon and his make \n Began to pray in feare. Then Jove thus gently them bespake: \n Declare thou ryghtuowse man, and thou woman meete to have \n A ryghtuowse howsband, what yee would most cheefly wish or crave. \n Philemon taking conference a little with his wyfe, \n Declared bothe theyr meenings thus: We covet during lyfe, \n Your Chapleynes for to bee to keepe your Temple. And bycause \n Our yeeres in concord wee have spent, I pray when death neere drawes, \n Let bothe of us togither leave our lives: that neyther I \n Behold my wyves deceace, nor shee see myne when I doo dye. \n Theyr wish had sequele to theyr will. As long as lyfe did last, \n They kept the Church. And beeing spent with age of yeares forepast, \n By chaunce as standing on a tyme without the Temple doore \n They told the fortune of the place, Philemon old and poore \n Saw Baucis floorish greene with leaves, and Baucis saw likewyse \n Philemon braunching out in boughes and twigs before hir eyes. \n And as the Bark did overgrow the heades of both, eche spake \n To other whyle they myght. At last they eche of them did take \n Theyr leave of other bothe at once, and therewithall the bark \n Did hyde theyr faces both at once. The Phrygians in that park \n Doo at this present day still shew the trees that shaped were \n Of theyr two bodies, growing yit togither joyntly there. \n Theis things did auncient men report of credit verie good. \n For why there was no cause why they should lye. As I there stood \n I saw the garlands hanging on the boughes, and adding new \n I sayd: Let them whom God dooth love be Gods, and honor dew \n Bee given to such as honor him with feare and reverence trew.\n\n \n",
            "9":"\n\n He hilld his peace, and bothe the thing and he that did it tell \n Did move them all, but Theseus most. Whom being mynded well \n To heere of woondrous things, the brooke of Calydon thus bespake: \n There are, O valiant knyght, sum folke that had the powre to take \n Straunge shape for once, and all their lyves continewed in the same. \n And other sum to sundrie shapes have power themselves to frame, \n As thou, O Protew, dwelling in the sea that cleepes the land. \n For now a yoonker, now a boare, anon a Lyon , and \n Streyght way thou didst become a Snake, and by and by a Bull \n That people were afrayd of thee to see thy horned skull. \n And oftentymes thou seemde a stone, and now and then a tree, \n And counterfetting water sheere thou seemedst oft to bee \n A River: and another whyle contrarie thereunto \n Thou wart a fyre. No lesser power than also thus to doo \n Had Erisicthons daughter whom Awtolychus tooke to wyfe. \n Her father was a person that despysed all his lyfe \n The powre of Gods, and never did vouchsauf them sacrifyse. \n He also is reported to have heawen in wicked wyse \n The grove of Ceres, and to fell her holy woods which ay \n Had undiminisht and unhackt continewed to that day. \n There stood in it a warrie Oke which was a wood alone. \n Uppon it round hung fillets, crownes, and tables, many one, \n The vowes of such as had obteynd theyr hearts desyre. Full oft \n The Woodnymphes underneath this tree did fetch theyr frisks aloft \n And oftentymes with hand in hand they daunced in a round \n About the Trunk, whose bignesse was of timber good and sound \n Full fifteene fadom. All the trees within the wood besyde, \n Were unto this, as weedes to them: so farre it did them hyde. \n Yit could not this move Triops sonne his axe therefro to hold, \n But bade his servants cut it downe. And when he did behold \n Them stunting at his hest, he snatcht an axe with furious mood \n From one of them, and wickedly sayd thus: Although thys wood \n Not only were the derling of the Goddesse, but also \n The Goddesse even herself: yet would I make it ere I go \n To kisse the clowers with her top that pranks with braunches so. \n This spoken, as he sweakt his axe asyde to fetch his blow, \n The manast Oke did quake and sygh, the Acornes that did grow \n Thereon togither with the leaves to wex full pale began, \n And shrinking in for feare the boughes and braunches looked wan. \n As soone as that his cursed hand had wounded once the tree, \n The blood came spinning from the carf, as freshly as yee see \n It issue from a Bullocks necke whose throte is newly cut \n Before the Altar, when his flesh to sacrifyse is put. \n They were amazed everychone. And one among them all \n To let the wicked act, durst from the tree his hatchet call. \n The lewd Thessalian facing him sayd: Take thou heere to thee \n The guerdon of thy godlynesse, and turning from the tree, \n He chopped off the fellowes head. Which done, he went agen \n And heawed on the Oke. Streight from amid the tree as then \n There issued such a sound as this: Within this tree dwell I \n A Nymph to Ceres very deere, who now before I dye \n In comfort of my death doo give thee warning thou shalt bye \n Thy dooing deere within a whyle. He goeth wilfully \n Still thorrough with his wickednesse, untill at length the Oke \n Pulld partly by the force of ropes, and cut with axis stroke, \n Did fall, and with his weyght bare downe of under wood great store. \n The Wood nymphes with the losses of the woods and theyrs ryght sore \n Amazed, gathered on a knot, and all in mourning weede \n Went sad to Ceres, praying her to wreake that wicked deede \n Of Erisicthons. Ceres was content it should bee so. \n And with the moving of her head in nodding to and fro, \n Shee shooke the feeldes which laden were with frutefull Harvest tho, \n And therewithall a punishment most piteous shee proceedes \n To put in practyse: were it not that his most heynous deedes \n No pitie did deserve to have at any bodies hand. \n With helpelesse hungar him to pyne, in purpose shee did stand. \n And forasmuch as shee herself and Famin myght not meete \n (For fate forbiddeth Famin to abyde within the leete \n Where plentie is) shee thus bespake a fayrie of the hill: \n There lyeth in the utmost bounds of Tartarie the chill \n A Dreerie place, a wretched soyle, a barreine plot: no grayne, \n No frute, no tree, is growing there: but there dooth ay remayne \n Unweeldsome cold, with trembling feare, and palenesse white as clowt, \n And foodlesse Famin. Will thou her immediatly withowt \n Delay to shed herself into the stomacke of the wretch, \n And let no plentie staunch her force but let her working stretch \n Above the powre of mee. And lest the longnesse of the way \n May make thee wearie, take thou heere my charyot: take I say \n My draggons for to beare thee through the aire.\n\n \n",
            "10":"\n\n In saving so \n She gave hir them. The Nymph mounts up, and flying thence as tho \n Alyghts in Scythy land, and up the cragged top of hye \n Mount Caucasus did cause hir Snakes with much adoo to stye. \n Where seeking long for Famin, shee the gaptoothd elfe did spye \n Amid a barreine stony feeld a ramping up the grasse \n With ougly nayles and chanking it. Her face pale colourd was. \n Hir heare was harsh and shirle, her eyes were sunken in her head. \n Her lyppes were hore with filth, her teeth were furd and rusty red. \n Her skinne was starched, and so sheere a man myght well espye \n The verie bowels in her bulk how every one did lye. \n And eke above her courbed loynes her withered hippes were seene. \n In stead of belly was a space where belly should have beene. \n Her brest did hang so sagging downe as that a man would weene \n That scarcely to her ridgebone had hir ribbes beene fastened well. \n Her leannesse made her joynts bolne big, and kneepannes for to swell. \n And with exceeding mighty knubs her heeles behynd boynd out. \n Now when the Nymph behild this elfe afarre, (she was in dout \n To come too neere her:) shee declarde her Ladies message. And \n In that same little whyle although the Nymph aloof did stand, \n And though shee were but newly come, yit seemed shee to feele \n The force of Famin. Wheruppon shee turning backe her wheele \n Did reyne her dragons up aloft: who streyght with courage free \n Conveyd her into Thessaly . Although that Famin bee \n Ay contrarye to Ceres woork, yit did shee then agree \n To do her will and glyding through the Ayre supported by \n The wynd, she found th'appoynted house: and entring by and by \n The caytifs chamber where he slept (it was in tyme of nyght) \n Shee hugged him betweene her armes there snorting bolt upryght, \n And breathing her into him, blew uppon his face and brest, \n That hungar in his emptie veynes myght woorke as hee did rest. \n And when she had accomplished her charge, shee then forsooke \n The frutefull Clymates of the world, and home ageine betooke \n Herself untoo her frutelesse feeldes and former dwelling place. \n The gentle sleepe did all this whyle with fethers soft embrace \n The wretched Erisicthons corse. Who dreaming streight of meate \n Did stirre his hungry jawes in vayne as though he had to eate \n And chanking tooth on tooth apace he gryndes them in his head, \n And occupies his emptie throte with swallowing, and in stead \n Of food devoures the lither ayre. But when that sleepe with nyght \n Was shaken off, immediatly a furious appetite \n Of feeding gan to rage in him, which in his greedy gummes \n And in his meatlesse maw dooth reigne unstauncht. Anon there cummes \n Before him whatsoever lives on sea, in aire or land: \n And yit he crieth still for more. And though the platters stand \n Before his face full furnished, yit dooth he still complayne \n Of hungar, craving meate at meale. The food that would susteine \n Whole householdes, Towneships, Shyres and Realmes suffyce not him alone. \n The more his pampred paunch consumes, the more it maketh mone \n And as the sea receyves the brookes of all the worldly Realmes, \n And yit is never satisfyde for all the forreine streames, \n And as the fell and ravening fyre refuseth never wood, \n But burneth faggots numberlesse, and with a furious mood \n The more it hath, the more it still desyreth evermore, \n Encreacing in devouring through encreasement of the store: \n So wicked Erisicthons mouth in swallowing of his meate \n Was ever hungry more and more, and longed ay to eate. \n Meate tolld in meate: and as he ate the place was empty still. \n The hungar of his brinklesse Maw, the gulf that nowght might fill, \n Had brought his fathers goods to nowght. But yit continewed ay \n His cursed hungar unappeasd: and nothing could alay I \n The flaming of his starved throte. At length when all was spent, \n And into his unfilled Maw bothe goods and lands were sent, \n An only daughter did remayne unworthy to have had \n So lewd a father. Hir he sold, so hard he was bestad. \n But shee of gentle courage could no bondage well abyde. \n And therfore stretching out her hands to seaward there besyde, \n Now save mee, quoth shee, from the yoke of bondage I thee pray, \n O thou that my virginitie enjoyest as a pray. \n Neptunus had it. Who to this her prayer did consent. \n And though her maister looking backe (for after him shee went) \n Had newly seene her: yit he turnd hir shape and made hir man, \n And gave her looke of fisherman. Her mayster looking than \n Upon her, sayd: Good fellow, thou that on the shore doost stand \n With angling rod and bayted hooke and hanging lyne in hand, \n I pray thee as thou doost desyre the Sea ay calme to thee, \n And fishes for to byght thy bayt, and striken still to bee, \n Tell where the frizzletopped wench in course and sluttish geere \n That stoode right now uppon this shore (for well I wote that heere \n I saw her standing) is become. For further than this place \n No footestep is appeering. Shee perceyving by the cace \n That Neptunes gift made well with her, and beeing glad to see \n Herself enquyrd for of herself, sayd thus: Who ere you bee \n I pray you for to pardon mee. I turned not myne eye \n A t'one syde ne a toother from this place, but did apply \n My labor hard. And that you may the lesser stand in dowt, \n So Neptune further still the Art and craft I go abowt, \n As now a whyle no living Wyght uppon this levell sand \n (Myself excepted) neyther man nor woman heere did stand. \n Her maister did beleeve her words: and turning backward went \n His way beguyld: and streight to her her native shape was sent. \n But when her father did perceyve his daughter for to have \n A bodye so transformable, he oftentymes her gave \n For monny. But the damzell still escaped, now a Mare \n And now a Cow, and now a Bird, a Hart, a Hynd, or Hare, \n And ever fed her hungry Syre with undeserved fare. \n But after that the maladie had wasted all the meates \n As well of store as that which shee had purchast by her feates: \n Most cursed keytife as he was, with bighting hee did rend \n His flesh, and by diminishing his bodye did intend \n To feede his bodye, till that death did speede his fatall end. \n But what meene I to busye mee in forreine matters thus? \n To alter shapes within precinct is lawfull even to us, \n My Lords. For sumtime I am such as you do now mee see, \n Sumtyme I wynd mee in a Snake: and oft I seeme to bee \n A Capteine of the herd with homes. For taking homes on mee \n I lost a tyne which heeretofore did arme mee as the print \n Dooth playnly shew. With that same word he syghed and did stint. \n"

For who would gladly show \n The combats in the which himself did take the overthrow? \n Yit will I make a just report in order of the same. \n For why? to have the woorser hand was not so great a shame, \n As was the honor such a match to undertake. And much \n It comforts mee that he who did mee overcome, was such \n A valiant champion. If perchaunce you erst have heard the name \n Of Deyanyre, the fayrest Mayd that ever God did frame \n Shee was in myne opinion. And the hope to win her love \n Did mickle envy and debate among hir wooers move. \n With whome I entring to the house of him that should have bee \n My fathrilaw: Parthaons sonne (I sayd) accept thou mee \n Thy Sonnylaw. And Hercules in selfsame sort did woo. \n And all the other suters streight gave place unto us two. \n He vaunted of his father Jove, and of his famous deedes, \n And how ageinst his stepdames spyght his prowesse still proceedes. \n And I ageine a toother syde sayd thus: It is a shame \n That God should yeeld to man. (This stryfe was long ere he became \n A God). Thou seeist mee a Lord of waters in thy Realme \n Where I in wyde and wynding banks doo beare my flowing streame. \n No straunger shalt thou have of mee sent farre from forreine land: \n But one of household, or at least a neyghbour heere at hand. \n Alonly let it bee to mee no hindrance that the wyfe \n Of Jove abhorres mee not, ne that upon the paine of lyfe \n Shee sets mee not to talk. For where thou bostest thee to bee \n Alcmenas sonne, Jove eyther is not father unto thee: \n Or if he bee it is by sin. In making Jove thy father, \n Thou maakst thy mother but a whore. Now choose thee whither rather \n Thou had to graunt this tale of Jove surmised for to bee, \n Or else thy selfe begot in shame and borne in bastardee. \n At that he grimly bendes his browes, and much adoo he hath \n To hold his hands, so sore his hart inflamed is with wrath. \n He said no more but thus: My hand dooth serve mee better than \n My toong. Content I am (so I in feighting vanquish can) \n That thou shalt overcome in wordes. And therewithall he gan \n Mee feercely to assaile. Mee thought it was a shame for mee \n That had even now so stoutly talkt, in dooings faint to bee. \n I casting off my greenish cloke thrust stifly out at length \n Mine armes and streynd my pawing armes to hold him out by strength, \n And framed every limme to cope. With both his hollow hands \n He caught up dust and sprincked mee: and I likewise with sands \n Made him all yelow too. One whyle hee at my necke dooth snatch \n Another whyle my cleere crisp legges he striveth for to catch, \n Or trippes at mee: and everywhere the vauntage he dooth watch. \n My weightinesse defended mee, and cleerly did disfeate \n His stoute assaults as when a wave with hideous noyse dooth beate \n Against a Rocke, the Rocke dooth still both sauf and sound abyde \n By reason of his massinesse. Wee drew a whyle asyde. \n And then incountring fresh ageine, wee kept our places stowt \n Full minded not to yeeld an inch, but for to hold it owt. \n Now were wee stonding foote to foote. And I with all my brest \n Was leaning forward, and with head ageinst his head did rest, \n And with my gryping fingars I ageinst his fingars thrust. \n So have I seene two myghtie Bulles togither feercely just \n In seeking as their pryse to have the fayrest Cow in all \n The feeld to bee their make, and all the herd bothe greate and small \n Stand gazing on them fearfully not knowing unto which \n The conquest of so greate a gayne shall fall. Three tymes a twich \n Gave Hercules and could not wrinch my leaning brest him fro \n But at the fourth he shooke mee off and made mee to let go \n My hold: and with a push (I will tell truthe) he had a knacke \n To turne me off, and heavily he hung upon my backe. \n And if I may beleeved bee (as sure I meene not I \n To vaunt my selfe vayngloriusly by telling of a lye,) \n Mee thought a mountaine whelmed me. But yit with much adoo \n I wrested in my sweating armes, and hardly did undoo \n His griping hands. He following still his vauntage, suffred not \n Mee once to breath or gather strength, but by and by he got \n Mee by the necke. Then was I fayne to sinke with knee to ground, \n And kisse the dust. Now when in strength too weake myself I found, \n I tooke mee to my slights, and slipt in shape of Snake away \n Of wondrous length. And when that I of purpose him to fray \n Did bend myself in swelling rolles, and made a hideous noyse \n Of hissing with my forked toong, he smyling at my toyes, \n And laughing them to scorne sayd thus: It is my Cradle game \n To vanquish Snakes, O Acheloy. Admit thou overcame \n All other Snakes, yet what art thou compared to the Snake \n Of Lerna, who by cutting off did still encreasement take? \n For of a hundred heades not one so soone was paarde away, \n But that uppon the stump therof there budded other tway. \n This sprouting Snake whose braunching heads by slaughter did revive \n And grow by cropping, I subdewd, and made it could not thryve. \n And thinkest thou (who being none wouldst seeme a Snake) to scape? \n Who doost with foorged weapons feyght and under borowed shape? \n This sayd, his fingars of my necke he fastned in the nape. \n Mee thought he graand my throte as though he did with pinsons nip. \n I struggled from his churlish thumbes my pinched chappes to slip \n But doo the best and worst I could he overcame mee so. \n Then thirdly did remayne the shape of Bull, and quickly tho \n I turning to the shape of Bull rebelld ageinst my fo. \n He stepping to my left syde cloce, did fold his armes about \n My wattled necke, and following mee then running maynely out \n Did drag mee backe, and made mee pitch my homes against the ground, \n And in the deepest of the sand he overthrew mee round. \n And yit not so content, such hold his cruell hand did take \n Uppon my welked horne, that he asunder quight it brake, \n And pulld it from my maymed brew. The waterfayries came \n And filling it with frute and flowres did consecrate the same, \n And so my horne the Tresory of plenteousnesse became. \n As soone as Acheloy had told this tale a wayting Mayd \n With flaring heare that lay on both hir shoulders and arrayd \n Like one of Dame Dianas Nymphes with solemne grace forth came \n And brought that rich and precious home, and heaped in the same \n All kynd of frutes that Harvest sendes, and specially such frute \n As serves for latter course at meales of every sort and sute. \n As soone as daylight came ageine, and that the Sunny rayes \n Did shyne upon the tops of things, the Princes went their wayes. \n They would not tarry till the floud were altogither falne \n And that the River in his banks ran low ageine and calme. \n Then Acheloy amid his waves his Crabtree face did hyde \n And head disarmed of a home. \n\n \n",
            "1":"\n\n And though he did abyde \n In all parts else bothe sauf and sound, yit this deformitye \n Did cut his comb: and for to hyde this blemish from the eye \n He hydes his hurt with Sallow leaves, or else with sedge and reede. \n But of the selfsame Mayd the love killd thee, feerce Nesse, in deede, \n When percing swiftly through thy back an arrow made thee bleede. \n For as Joves issue with his wyfe was onward on his way \n In going to his countryward, enforst he was to stay \n At swift Euenus bank, bycause the streame was risen sore \n Above his bounds through rage of rayne that fell but late before. \n Agein so full of whoorlpooles and of gulles the channell was, \n That scarce a man could any where fynd place of passage. As \n Not caring for himself but for his wyfe he there did stand, \n This Nessus came unto him (who was strong of body and \n Knew well the foordes), and sayd: Use thou thy strength, O Hercules , \n In swimming. I will fynd the meanes this Ladie shall with ease \n Bee set uppon the further bank. So Hercules betooke \n His wyfe to Nessus. Shee for feare of him and of the brooke \n Lookte pale. Her husband as he had his quiver by his syde \n Of arrowes full, and on his backe his heavy Lyons hyde, \n (For to the further bank he erst his club and bow had cast) \n Said: Sith I have begonne, this brooke bothe must and shalbee past. \n He never casteth further doubts, nor seekes the calmest place, \n But through the roughest of the streame he cuts his way apace. \n Now as he on the furthersyde was taking up his bow, \n His heard his wedlocke shreeking out, and did hir calling know: \n And cryde to Nesse (who went about to deale unfaythfully \n In running with his charge away): Whoa, whither doost thou fly, \n Thou Royster thou, uppon vaine hope by swiftnesse to escape \n My hands? I say give eare thou Nesse for all thy double shape, \n And meddle not with that thats myne. Though no regard of mee \n Might move thee to refrayne from rape, thy father yit might bee \n A warning, who for offring shame to Juno now dooth feele \n Continuall torment in his limbes by turning on a wheele. \n For all that thou hast horses feete which doo so bolde thee make, \n Yit shalt thou not escape my hands. I will thee overtake \n With wound and not with feete. He did according as he spake. \n For with an arrow as he fled he strake him through the backe, \n And out before his brist ageine the hooked iron stacke. \n And when the same was pulled out, the blood amayne ensewd \n At both the holes with poyson foule of Lerna Snake embrewd: \n This blood did Nessus take, and said within himselfe: Well: sith \n I needes must dye, yet will I not dye unrevendgd. And with \n The same he staynd a shirt, and gave it unto Dyanyre, \n Assuring hir it had the powre to kindle Cupids fyre. \n A greate whyle after when the deedes of worthy Hercules \n Were such as filled all the world, and also did appease \n The hatred of his stepmother, as he uppon a day \n With conquest from Oechalia came, and was abowt to pay \n His vowes to Jove uppon the Mount of Cenye, tatling fame \n (Who in reporting things of truth delyghts to sauce the same \n With tales, and of a thing of nowght dooth ever greater grow \n Through false and newly forged lyes that shee hirself dooth sow) \n Told Dyanyre that Hercules did cast a liking to \n A Ladie called Iolee. And Dyanyra (whoo \n Was jealous over Hercules,) gave credit to the same. \n And when that of a Leman first the tidings to hir came, \n She being striken to the hart, did fall to teares alone, \n And in a lamentable wise did make most wofull mone. \n Anon she said: what meene theis teares thus gushing from myne eyen? \n My husbands Leman will rejoyce at theis same teares of myne. \n Nay, sith she is to come, the best it were to shonne delay, \n And for to woork sum new devyce and practyse whyle I may, \n Before that in my bed her limbes the filthy strumpet lay. \n And shall I then complayne? or shall I hold my toong with skill? \n Shall I returne to Calydon? or shall I tarry still? \n Or shall I get me out of doores, and let them have their will? \n What if that I (Meleager) remembring mee to bee \n Thy suster, to attempt sum act notorious did agree? \n And in a harlots death did shew (that all the world myght see) \n What greef can cause the womankynd to enterpryse among? \n And specially when thereunto they forced are by wrong. \n With wavering thoughts ryght violently her mynd was tossed long. \n At last shee did preferre before all others, for to send \n The shirt bestayned with the blood of Nessus to the end \n To quicken up the quayling love. And so not knowing what \n She gave, she gave her owne remorse and greef to Lychas that \n Did know as little as herself: and wretched woman, shee \n Desyrd him gently to her Lord presented it to see. \n The noble Prince receyving it without mistrust therein, \n Did weare the poyson of the Snake of Lerna next his skin. \n To offer incense and to pray to Jove he did begin, \n And on the Marble Altar he full boawles of wyne did shed, \n When as the poyson with the heate resolving, largely spred \n Through all the limbes of Hercules. As long as ere he could, \n The stoutnesse of his hart was such, that sygh no whit he would. \n But when the mischeef grew so great all pacience to surmount, \n He thrust the altar from him streight, and filled all the mount \n Of Oeta with his roring out. He went about to teare \n The deathfull garment from his backe, but where he pulled, there \n He pulld away the skin: and (which is lothsum to report) \n It eyther cleaved to his limbes and members in such sort \n As that he could not pull it off, or else it tare away \n The flesh, that bare his myghty bones and grisly sinewes lay. \n The scalding venim boyling in his blood, did make it hisse, \n As when a gad of steel red hot in water quenched is. \n\n \n",

Thus much did Hercule say. \n And wounded over Oeta hygh, he stalking gan to stray, \n As when a Bull in maymed bulk a deadly dart dooth beare, \n And that the dooer of the deede is shrunke asyde for feare. \n Oft syghing myght you him have seene, oft trembling, oft about \n To teare the garment with his hands from top to toe throughout, \n And throwing downe the myghtye trees, and chaufing with the hilles, \n Or casting up his handes to heaven where Jove his father dwelles. \n Behold as Lychas trembling in a hollow rock did lurk, \n He spyed him. And as his greef did all in furie woork, \n He sayd: Art thou, syr Lychas, he that broughtest unto mee \n This plagye present? of my death must thou the woorker bee? \n Hee quaakt and shaakt, and looked pale, and fearfully gan make \n Excuse. But as with humbled hands hee kneeling to him spake, \n The furious Hercule caught him up, and swindging him about \n His head a halfe a doozen tymes or more, he floong him out \n Into th'Euboyan sea with force surmounting any sling. \n He hardened into peble stone as in the ayre he hing. \n And even as rayne conjeald by wynd is sayd to turne to snowe, \n And of the snow round rolled up a thicker masse to growe, \n Which falleth downe in hayle: so men in auncient tyme report, \n That Lychas beeing swindgd about by violence in that sort, \n (His blood then beeing drayned out, and having left at all \n No moysture,) into peble stone was turned in his fall. \n Now also in th'Euboyan sea appeeres a hygh short rocke \n In shape of man ageinst the which the shipmen shun to knocke, \n As though it could them feele, and they doo call it by the name \n Of Lychas still. But thou Joves imp of great renowme and fame, \n Didst fell the trees of Oeta high, and making of the same \n A pyle, didst give to Poeans sonne thy quiver and thy bow, \n And arrowes which should help agein Troy towne to overthrow. \n He put to fyre, and as the same was kindling in the pyle, \n Thy selfe didst spred thy Lyons skin upon the wood the whyle, \n And leaning with thy head ageinst thy Club, thou laydst thee downe \n As cheerfully, as if with flowres and garlonds on thy crowne \n Thou hadst beene set a banquetting among full cups of wyne. \n Anon on every syde about those carelesse limbes of thyne \n The fyre began to gather strength, and crackling noyse did make, \n Assayling him whose noble hart for daliance did it take. \n The Goddes for this defender of the earth were sore afrayd \n To whom with cheerefull countnance Jove perceyving it thus sayd: \n This feare of yours is my delyght, and gladly even with all \n My hart I doo rejoyce, O Gods, that mortall folk mee call \n Their king and father, thinking mee ay myndfull of their weale, \n And that myne offspring should doo well your selves doo show such zeale. \n For though that you doo attribute your favor to desert, \n Considring his most woondrous acts: yit I too for my part \n Am bound unto you. Nerethelesse, for that I would not have \n Your faythfull harts without just cause in fearfull passions wave, \n I would not have you of the flames in Oeta make account. \n For as he hath all other things, so shall he them surmount. \n Save only on that part that he hath taken of his mother, \n The fyre shall have no power at all. Eternall is the tother, \n The which he takes of mee, and cannot dye, ne yeeld to fyre. \n When this is rid of earthly drosse, then will I lift it hygher, \n And take it unto heaven: and I beleeve this deede of myne \n Will gladsome bee to all the Gods. If any doo repyne, \n If any doo repyne, I say, that Hercule should become \n A God, repyne he still for mee, and looke he sowre and glum. \n But let him know that Hercules deserveth this reward, \n And that he shall ageinst his will alow it afterward. \n The Gods assented everychone. And Juno seemd to make \n No evill countnance to the rest, untill hir husband spake \n The last. For then her looke was such as well they might perceyve, \n Shee did her husbands noting her in evil part conceyve. \n Whyle Jove was talking with the Gods, as much as fyre could waste \n So much had fyre consumde. And now, O Hercules, thou haste \n No carkesse for to know thee by. That part is quyght bereft \n Which of thy mother thou didst take. Alonly now is left \n The likenesse that thou tookst of Jove. And as the Serpent slye \n In casting of his withered slough, renewes his yeeres thereby, \n And wexeth lustyer than before, and looketh crisp and bryght \n With scoured scales: so Hercules as soone as that his spryght \n Had left his mortall limbes, gan in his better part to thryve, \n And for to seeme a greater thing than when he was alyve, \n And with a stately majestie ryght reverend to appeere. \n His myghty father tooke him up above the cloudy spheere, \n And in a charyot placed him among the streaming starres.\n\n \n",

The woords that I did speake, \n Were such as even the hardest stones of very flint myght breake. \n The wyves of Thebee beeing there, for sauf deliverance prayd \n And giving cheerfull woords, did bid I should not bee dismayd. \n Among the other women there that to my labor came, \n There was an honest yeomans wyfe, Galantis was her name. \n Her heare was yellow as the gold, she was a jolly Dame. \n And stoutly served mee, and I did love her for the same. \n This wyfe (I know not how) did smell some packing gone about \n On Junos part. And as she oft was passing in and out, \n Shee spyde Lucina set uppon the altar holding fast \n Her armes togither on her knees, and with her fingars cast \n Within ech other on a knot, and sayd unto her thus: \n I pray you who so ere you bee, rejoyce you now with us, \n My Lady Alcmen hath her wish, and sauf is brought abed. \n Lucina leaped up amazde at that that shee had sed, \n And let her hands asunder slip. And I immediatly \n With loosening of the knot, had sauf deliverance by and by. \n They say that in deceyving Dame Lucina Galant laught. \n And therfore by the yellow locks the Goddesse wroth hir caught, \n And dragged her. And as she would have risen from the ground, \n She kept her downe, and into legges her armes shee did confound. \n Her former stoutnesse still remaynes: her backe dooth keepe the hew \n That erst was in her heare: her shape is only altered new. \n And for with lying mouth shee helpt a woman laboring, shee \n Dooth kindle also at her mouth. And now she haunteth free \n Our houses as shee did before, a Weasle as wee see. \n\n \n",
            "4":"\n\n With that shee syghes to think uppon her servants hap, and then \n Her daughtrinlaw immediatly replied thus agen: \n But mother, shee whose altred shape dooth move your hart so sore, \n Was neyther kith nor kin to you. What will you say therefore, \n If of myne owne deere suster I the woondrous fortune show, \n Although my sorrow and the teares that from myne eyes doo flow, \n Doo hinder mee, and stop my speeche? Her mother (you must know \n My father by another wyfe had mee) bare never mo \n But this same Ladie Dryopee, the fayrest Ladye tho \n In all the land of Oechalye. Whom beeing then no mayd \n (For why the God of Delos and of Delphos had her frayd) \n Andraemon taketh to hys wyfe, and thinkes him well apayd. \n There is a certaine leaning Lake whose bowing banks doo show \n A likenesse of the salt sea shore. Uppon the brim doo grow \n All round about it Mirtletrees. My suster thither goes \n Unwares what was her destinie, and (which you may suppose \n Was more to bee disdeyned at) the cause of comming there \n Was to the fayries of the Lake fresh garlonds for to beare. \n And in her armes a babye her sweete burthen shee did hold. \n Who sucking on her brest was yit not full a twelvemoonth old. \n Not farre from this same pond did grow a Lote tree florisht gay \n With purple flowres and beries sweete, and leaves as greene as Bay. \n Of theis same flowres to please her boy my suster gathered sum, \n And I had thought to doo so too, for I was thither cum. \n I saw how from the slivered flowres red drops of blood did fall, \n And how that shuddring horribly the braunches quaakt withall. \n You must perceyve that (as too late the Countryfolk declare) \n A Nymph cald Lotos flying from fowle Pryaps filthy ware, \n Was turned into this same tree reserving still her name. \n My suster did not know so much, who when shee backward came \n Afrayd at that that shee had seene, and having sadly prayd \n The Nymphes of pardon, to have gone her way agen assayd: \n Her feete were fastned downe with rootes. Shee stryved all she myght \n To plucke them up, but they so sure within the earth were pyght, \n That nothing save her upper partes shee could that present move. \n A tender barke growes from beneath up leysurly above, \n And softly overspreddes her loynes, which when shee saw, shee went \n About to teare her heare, and full of leaves her hand shee hent. \n Her head was overgrowen with leaves. And little Amphise (so \n Had Eurytus his Graundsyre naamd her sonne not long ago) \n Did feele his mothers dugges wex hard. And as he still them drew \n In sucking, not a whit of milke nor moysture did ensew. \n I standing by thee did behold thy cruell chaunce: but nought \n I could releeve thee, suster myne. Yit to my powre I wrought \n To stay the growing of thy trunk and of thy braunches by \n Embracing thee. Yea I protest I would ryght willingly \n Have in the selfesame barke with thee bene closed up. Behold, \n Her husband, good Andraemon, and her wretched father, old \n Sir Eurytus came thither and enquyrd for Dryopee. \n And as they askt for Dryopee, I shewd them Lote the tree. \n They kist the wood which yit was warme, and falling downe bylow, \n Did hug the rootes of that their tree. My suster now could show \n No part which was not wood except her face. A deawe of teares \n Did stand uppon the wretched leaves late formed of her heares. \n And whyle she might, and whyle her mouth did give her way to speake, \n With such complaynt as this, her mynd shee last or all did breake: \n If credit may bee given to such as are in wretchednesse, \n I sweare by God I never yit deserved this distresse. \n I suffer peyne without desert. My lyfe hath guiltlesse beene. \n And if I lye, I would theis boughes of mine which now are greene, \n Myght withered bee, and I heawen downe and burned in the fyre. \n This infant from his mothers wombe remove you I desyre: \n And put him forth to nurce, and cause him underneath my tree \n Oft tymes to sucke, and oftentymes to play. And when that hee \n Is able for to speake I pray you let him greete mee heere, \n And sadly say: in this same trunk is hid my mother deere. \n But lerne him for to shun all ponds and pulling flowres from trees, \n And let him in his heart beleeve that all the shrubs he sees, \n Are bodyes of the Goddesses. Adew deere husband now, \n Adew deere father, and adew deere suster. And in yow \n If any love of mee remayne, defend my boughes I pray \n From wound of cutting hooke and ax, and bite of beast for ay. \n And for I cannot stoope to you, rayse you yourselves to mee, \n And come and kisse mee whyle I may yit toucht and kissed bee. \n And lift mee up my little boy. I can no lenger talke, ^ \n For now about my lillye necke as if it were a stalke \n The tender rynd beginnes to creepe, and overgrowes my top. \n Remove your fingars from my face. The spreading barke dooth stop \n My dying eyes without your help. Shee had no sooner left \n Her talking, but her lyfe therewith togither was bereft. \n But yit a goodwhyle after that her native shape did fade, \n Her newmade boughes continewed warme. Now whyle that Iole made \n Report of this same woondrous tale, and whyle Alcmena (who \n Did weepe) was drying up the teares of Iole weeping too, \n By putting to her thomb: there hapt a sodeine thing so straunge, \n That unto mirth from heavinesse theyr harts it streight did chaunge. \n For at the doore in manner even a very boy as then \n With short soft Downe about his chin, revoked backe agen \n To youthfull yeares, stood Iolay with countnance smooth and trim. \n Dame Hebee, Junos daughter, had bestowde this gift on him, \n Entreated at his earnest sute. Whom mynding fully there \n The giving of like gift ageine to any to forsweare, \n Dame Themis would not suffer. For (quoth shee) this present howre \n Is cruell warre in Thebee towne, and none but Jove hath powre \n To vanquish stately Canapey. The brothers shall alike \n Wound eyther other. And alyve a Prophet shall go seeke \n His owne quicke ghoste among the dead, the earth him swallowing in. \n The sonne by taking vengeance for his fathers death shall win \n The name of kynd and wicked man, in one and selfsame cace. \n And flayght with mischeefes, from his wits and from his native place \n The furies and his mothers ghoste shall restlessely him chace, \n Untill his wyfe demaund of him the fatall gold for meede, \n And that his cousin Phegies swoord doo make his sydes to bleede. \n Then shall the fayre Callirrhoee, Achelous daughter, pray \n The myghty Jove in humble wyse to graunt her children may \n Retyre ageine to youthfull yeeres, and that he will not see \n The death of him that did revenge unvenged for to bee. \n Jove moved at her sute shall cause his daughtrinlaw to give \n Like gift, and backe from age to youth Callirrhoes children drive.\n\n \n",
            "5":"\n\n When Themis through foresyght had spoke theis woords of prophesie, \n The Gods began among themselves vayne talke to multiplie, \n They mooyld why others myght not give like gift as well as shee. \n First Pallants daughter grudged that her husband old should bee. \n The gentle Ceres murmurde that her Iasions heare was hore. \n And Vulcane would have calld ageine the yeeres long spent before \n By Ericthonius. And the nyce Dame Venus having care \n Of tyme to come, the making yong of old Anchises sware. \n So every God had one to whom he speciall favor bare. \n And through this partiall love of theyrs seditiously increast \n A hurlyburly, till the time that Jove among them preast, \n And sayd: So smally doo you stand in awe of mee this howre, \n As thus too rage? Thinkes any of you himself to have such powre, \n As for to alter destinye? I tell you Iolay \n Recovered hath by destinye his yeeres erst past away, \n Callirrhoes children must returne to youth by destiny, \n And not by force of armes, or sute susteynd ambitiously. \n And to th'entent with meelder myndes yee may this matter beare, \n Even I myself by destinyes am rulde. Which if I were \n Of power to alter, thinke you that our Aeacus should stoope \n By reason of his feeble age? or Radamanth should droope? \n Or Minos, who by reason of his age is now disdeynd, \n And lives not in so sure a state as heretofore he reygnd? \n The woords of Jove so movd the Gods that none of them complaynd, \n Sith Radamanth and Aeacus were both with age constreynd: \n And Minos also: who (as long as lusty youth did last,) \n Did even with terror of his name make myghty Realmes agast. \n But then was Minos weakened sore, and greatly stood in feare \n Of Milet , one of Deyons race: who proudly did him beare \n Uppon his father Phoebus and the stoutnesse of his youth. \n And though he feard he would rebell: yit durst he not his mouth \n Once open for to banish him his Realme: untill at last \n Departing of his owne accord, Miletus swiftly past \n The Gotesea and did build a towne uppon the Asian ground, \n Which still reteynes the name of him that first the same did found. \n And there the daughter of the brooke Maeander which dooth go \n So often backward, Cyane, a Nymph of body so \n Exceeding comly as the lyke was seldome heard of, as \n Shee by her fathers wynding bankes for pleasure walking was, \n Was knowen by Milet : unto whom a payre of twinnes shee brought, \n And of the twinnes the names were Caune and Byblis. Byblis ought \n To bee a mirror unto Maydes in lawfull wyse to love. \n This Byblis cast a mynd to Caune, but not as did behove \n A suster to her brotherward. When first of all the fyre \n Did kindle, shee perceyvd it not. Shee thought in her desyre \n Of kissing him so oftentymes no sin, ne yit no harme \n In cleeping him about the necke so often with her arme. \n The glittering glosse of godlynesse beguyld her long. Her love \n Began from evill unto woorse by little too remove. \n Shee commes to see her brother deckt in brave and trim attyre, \n And for to seeme exceeding fayre it was her whole desyre. \n And if that any fayrer were in all the flocke than shee, \n It spyghts her. In what case she was as yit shee did not see. \n Her heate exceeded not so farre as for to vow: and yit \n Shee suffred in her troubled brist full many a burning fit. \n Now calleth shee him mayster, now shee utter hateth all \n The names of kin. Shee rather had he should her Byblis call \n Than suster. Yit no filthy hope shee durst permit to creepe \n Within her mynd awake. But as shee lay in quiet sleepe, \n Shee oft behild her love: and oft she thought her brother came \n And lay with her, and (though asleepe) shee blushed at the same. \n When sleepe was gone, she long lay dumb still musing on the syght, \n And said with wavering mynd: Now wo is mee, most wretched wyght. \n What meenes the image of this dreame that I have seene this nyght? \n I would not wish it should bee trew. Why dreamed I then so? \n Sure hee is fayre although hee should bee judged by his fo. \n He likes mee well, and were he not my brother, I myght set \n My love on him, and he were mee ryght woorthy for to get, \n But unto this same match the name of kinred is a let. \n Well, so that I awake doo still mee undefylde keepe, \n Let come as often as they will such dreamings in my sleepe. \n In sleepe there is no witnesse by. In sleepe yit may I take \n As greate a pleasure (in a sort) as if I were awake. \n Oh Venus and thy tender sonne, Sir Cupid, what delyght, \n How present feeling of your sport hath touched mee this nyght. \n How lay I as it were resolvd both maree, flesh, and bone. \n How gladdes it mee to thinke thereon. Alas too soone was gone \n That pleasure, and too hastye and despyghtfull was the nyght \n In breaking of my joyes. O Lord, if name of kinred myght \n Betweene us two removed bee, how well it would agree, \n O Caune, that of thy father I the daughtrinlaw should bee. \n How fitly myght my father have a sonneinlaw of thee. \n Would God that all save auncesters were common to us twayne. \n I would thou were of nobler stocke than I. I cannot sayne, \n O perle of beautie, what shee is whom thou shalt make a mother. \n Alas how ill befalles it mee that I could have none other \n Than those same parents which are thyne. So only still my brother \n And not my husband mayst thou bee. The thing that hurts us bothe \n Is one, and that betweene us ay inseparably gothe. \n What meene my dreames then? what effect have dreames? and may there bee \n Effect in dreames? The Gods are farre in better case than wee. \n For why? the Gods have matched with theyr susters as wee see. \n So Saturne did alie with Ops, the neerest of his blood. \n So Tethys with Oceanus: So Jove did think it good \n To take his suster Juno to his wyfe. What then? the Goddes \n Have lawes and charters by themselves. And sith there is such oddes \n Betweene the state of us and them, why should I sample take, \n Our worldly matters equall with the heavenly things to make? \n This wicked love shall eyther from my hart be driven away, \n Or if it can not bee expulst, God graunt I perish may, \n And that my brother kisse me, layd on Herce to go to grave. \n But my desyre the full consent of both of us dooth crave. \n Admit the matter liketh me. He will for sin it take. \n But yit the sonnes of Aeolus no scrupulousnesse did make \n In going to theyr susters beds. And how come I to know \n The feates of them? To what intent theis samples doo I show? \n Ah whither am I headlong driven? avaunt foule filthy fyre: \n And let mee not in otherwyse than susterlyke desyre \n My brothers love. Yit if that he were first in love with mee, \n His fondnesse to inclyne unto perchaunce I could agree. \n Shall I therefore who would not have rejected him if hee \n Had sude to mee, go sue to him? and canst thou speake in deede? \n And canst thou utter forth thy mynd? and tell him of thy neede? \n My love will make mee speake. I can. Or if that shame doo stay \n My toong, a sealed letter shall my secret love bewray.\n\n \n",
            "6":"\n\n This likes her best. Uppon this poynt now restes her doubtful mynd. \n So raysing up herself uppon her leftsyde shee enclynd, \n And leaning on her elbow sayd: Let him advyse him what \n To doo, for I my franticke love will utter playne and flat. \n Alas to what ungraciousnesse intend I for to fall? \n What furie raging in my hart my senses dooth appall? \n In thinking so, with trembling hand shee framed her to wryght \n The matter that her troubled mynd in musing did indyght. \n Her ryght hand holdes the pen, her left dooth hold the empty wax. \n She ginnes. Shee doutes, shee wryghtes: shee in the tables findeth lacks. \n She notes, she blurres, dislikes, and likes: and chaungeth this for that. \n Shee layes away the booke, and takes it up. Shee wotes not what \n She would herself. What ever thing shee myndeth for to doo \n Misliketh her. A shamefastnesse with boldenesse mixt thereto \n Was in her countnance. Shee had once writ Suster: Out agen \n The name of Suster for to raze shee thought it best. And then \n She snatcht the tables up, and did theis following woords ingrave: \n The health which if thou give her not shee is not like to have \n Thy lover wisheth unto thee. I dare not ah for shame \n I dare not tell thee who I am, nor let thee heare my name. \n And if thou doo demaund of mee what thing I doo desyre, \n Would God that namelesse I myght pleade the matter I requyre, \n And that I were unknowen to thee by name of Byblis, till \n Assurance of my sute were wrought according to my will. \n As tokens of my wounded hart myght theis to thee appeere: \n My colour pale, my body leane, my heavy mirthlesse cheere, \n My watry eyes, my sighes without apparent causes why, \n My oft embracing of thee: and such kisses (if perdye \n Thou marked them) as very well thou might have felt and found \n Not for to have beene Susterlike. But though with greevous wound \n I then were striken to the hart, although the raging flame \n Did burne within: yit take I God to witnesse of the same, \n I did as much as lay in mee this outrage for to tame. \n And long I stryved (wretched wench) to scape the violent Dart \n Of Cupid. More I have endurde of hardnesse and of smart, \n Than any wench (a man would think) were able to abyde. \n Force forceth mee to shew my case which faine I still would hyde, \n And mercy at thy gentle hand in fearfull wyse to crave. \n Thou only mayst the lyfe of mee thy lover spill or save. \n Choose which thou wilt. No enmy craves this thing: but such a one \n As though shee bee alyde so sure as surer can bee none, \n Yit covets shee more surely yit alyed for to bee, \n And with a neerer kynd of band to link her selfe to thee. \n Let aged folkes have skill in law: to age it dooth belong \n To keepe the rigor of the lawes and search out ryght from wrong. \n Such youthfull yeeres as ours are yit rash folly dooth beseeme. \n Wee know not what is lawfull yit. And therefore wee may deeme \n That all is lawfull that wee list: ensewing in the same \n The dooings of the myghtye Goddes. Not dread of worldly shame \n Nor yit our fathers roughnesse, no nor fearfulnesse should let \n Our purpose. Only let all feare asyde be wholy set. \n ~Wee underneath the name of kin our pleasant scapes may hyde. \n Thou knowest I have libertie to talke with thee asyde, \n And openly wee kysse and cull. And what is all the rest \n That wants? Have mercy on mee now, who playnly have exprest \n My case: which thing I had not done, but that the utter rage \n Of love constreynes mee thereunto the which I cannot swage. \n Deserve not on my tumb thy name subscribed for to have, \n That thou art he whose cruelnesse did bring mee to my grave. \n Thus much shee wrate in vayne, and wax did want her to indyght, \n And in the margent she was fayne the latter verse to wryght. \n Immediatly to seale her shame shee takes a precious stone, \n The which shee moystes with teares: from tung the moysture quight was gone. \n She calld a servant shamefastly, and after certaine fayre \n And gentle woords: My trusty man, I pray thee beare this payre \n Of tables (quoth shee) to my (and a great whyle afterward \n Shee added) brother. Now through chaunce or want of good regard \n The table slipped downe to ground in reaching to him ward. \n The handsell troubled sore her mynd. But yit shee sent them. And \n Her servant spying tyme did put them into Caunyes hand. \n Maeanders nephew sodeinly in anger floong away \n The tables ere he half had red, (scarce able for to stay \n His fistocke from the servants face who quaakt) and thus did say: \n Avaunt, thou baudye ribawd, whyle thou mayst. For were it not \n For shame I should have killed thee. Away afrayd he got, \n And told his mistresse of the feerce and cruell answer made \n By Caunye. By and by the hew of Byblis gan to fade, \n And all her body was benumd with Icie colde for feare \n To heere of this repulse. Assoone as that her senses were \n Returnd ageine, her furious flames returned with her witts. \n And thus shee sayd so soft that scarce hir toong the ayer hitts: \n And woorthely. For why was I so rash as to discover \n By hasty wryghting this my wound which most I ought to cover? \n I should with dowtfull glauncing woords have felt his humor furst, \n And made a trayne to trye him if pursue or no he durst. \n I should have vewed first the coast, to see the weather cleere, \n And then I myght have launched sauf and boldly from the peere. \n But now I hoyst up all my sayles before I tryde the wynd: \n And therfore am I driven uppon the rockes against my mynd, \n And all the sea dooth overwhelme mee. Neyther may I fynd \n The meanes to get to harbrough, or from daunger to retyre. \n Why did not open tokens warne to bridle my desyre, \n Then when the tables falling in delivering them declaard \n My hope was vaine? And ought not I then eyther to have spaard \n From sending them as that day? or have chaunged whole my mynd? \n Nay rather shifted of the day? For had I not beene blynd \n Even God himself by soothfast signes the sequele seemd to hit. \n Yea rather than to wryghting thus my secrets to commit, \n I should have gone and spoke myself, and presently have showde \n My fervent love. He should have seene how teares had from mee flowde. \n Hee should have seene my piteous looke ryght loverlike. I could \n Have spoken more than into those my tables enter would. \n About his necke against his will, myne armes I myght have wound \n And had he shaakt me off, I myght have seemed for to swound. \n I humbly myght have kist his feete, and kneeling on the ground \n Besought him for to save my lyfe. All theis I myght have proved, \n Wherof although no one alone his stomacke could have moved, \n Yit all togither myght have made his hardened hart relent. \n Perchaunce there was some fault in him that was of message sent. \n He stept unto him bluntly (I beleeve) and did not watch \n Convenient tyme, in merrie kew at leysure him to catch. \n Theis are the things that hindred mee. For certeinly I knowe \n No sturdy stone nor massy steele dooth in his stomacke grow. \n He is not made of Adamant. He is no Tygers whelp. \n He never sucked Lyonesse. He myght with little help \n Bee vanquisht. Let us give fresh charge uppon him. Whyle I live \n Without obteyning victorie I will not over give. \n For firstly (if it lay in mee my dooings to revoke) \n I should not have begonne at all. But seeing that the stroke \n Is given, the second poynt is now to give the push to win. \n For neyther he (although that I myne enterpryse should blin) \n Can ever whyle he lives forget my deede. And sith I shrink, \n My love was lyght, or else I meant to trap him, he shall think. \n Or at the least he may suppose that this my rage of love \n Which broyleth so within my brest, proceedes not from above \n By Cupids stroke, but of some foule and filthy lust. In fyne \n I cannot but to wickednesse now more and more inclyne. \n By wryghting is my sute commenst: my meening dooth appeere: \n And though I cease: yit can I not accounted bee for cleere. \n Now that that dooth remayne behynd is much as in respect \n My fond desyre to satisfy: and little in effect \n To aggravate my fault withall. \n\n \n",

And therefore if thou bring \n A wench (it goes ageinst my heart to thinke uppon the thing) \n Although ageinst my will, I charge it streyght destroyed bee. \n The bond of nature needes must beare in this behalf with mee \n This sed, both wept exceedingly, as well the husband who \n Did give commaundement, as the wyfe that was commaunded too. \n Yit Telethusa earnestly at Lyct her husband lay, \n (Although in vayne) to have good hope, and of himselfe more stay. \n But he was full determined. Within a whyle, the day \n Approched that the frute was rype, and shee did looke to lay \n Her belly every mynute: when at midnyght in her rest \n Stood by her (or did seeme to stand) the Goddesse Isis, drest \n And trayned with the solemne pomp of all her rytes. Two homes \n Uppon her forehead lyke the moone, with eares of rypened comes \n Stood glistring as the burnisht gold. Moreover shee did weare \n A rich and stately diademe. Attendant on her were \n The barking bug Anubis, and the saint of Bubast, and \n The pydecote Apis, and the God that gives to understand \n By fingar holden to his lippes that men should silence keepe, \n And Lybian wormes whose strnging dooth enforce continuall sleepe, \n And thou, Osyris, whom the folk of Aegypt ever seeke, \n And never can have sought inough, and Rittlerattles eke. \n Then even as though that Telethuse had fully beene awake, \n And seene theis things with open eyes, thus Isis to her spake: \n My servant Telethusa, cease this care, and breake the charge \n Of Lyct. And when Lucina shall have let thy frute at large, \n Bring up the same what ere it bee. I am a Goddesse who \n Delyghts in helping folke at neede. I hither come to doo \n Thee good. Thou shalt not have a cause hereafter to complayne \n Of serving of a Goddesse that is thanklesse for thy payne. \n When Isis had this comfort given, shee went her way agayne. \n A joyfull wyght rose Telethuse, and lifting to the sky \n Her hardened hands, did pray hir dreame myght woorke effectually. \n Her throwes increast, and forth alone anon the burthen came, \n A wench was borne to Lyctus who knew nothing of the same. \n The mother making him beleeve it was a boay, did bring \n It up, and none but shee and nurce were privie to the thing. \n The father thanking God did give the chyld the Graundsyres name, \n The which was Iphys. Joyfull was the moother of the same, \n Bycause the name did serve alike to man and woman bothe, \n And so the lye through godly guile forth unperceyved gothe. \n The garments of it were a boayes. The face of it was such \n As eyther in a boay or gyrle of beawtie uttered much. \n When Iphys was of thirteene yeeres, her father did insure \n The browne Ianthee unto her, a wench of looke demure, \n Commended for her favor and her person more than all \n The Maydes of Phestos: Telest, men her fathers name did call. \n He dwelt in Dyctis. They were bothe of age and favor leeke, \n And under both one schoolemayster they did for nurture seeke. \n And hereupon the hartes of both, the dart of Love did streeke, \n And wounded both of them aleeke. But unlike was theyr hope. \n Both longed for the wedding day togither for to cope. \n For whom Ianthee thinkes to bee a man, shee hopes to see \n Her husband. Iphys loves whereof shee thinkes shee may not bee \n Partaker, and the selfesame thing augmenteth still her flame. \n Herself a Mayden with a Mayd (ryght straunge) in love became. \n Shee scarce could stay her teares. What end remaynes for mee (quoth shee) \n How straunge a love? how uncoth? how prodigious reygnes in mee? \n If that the Gods did favor mee, they should destroy mee quyght. \n Of if they would not mee destroy, at least wyse yit they myght \n Have given mee such a maladie as myght with nature stond, \n Or nature were acquainted with. A Cow is never fond \n Uppon a Cow, nor Mare on Mare. The Ram delyghts the Eawe, \n The Stag the Hynde, the Cocke the Hen. But never men could shew, \n That female yit was tane in love with female kynd. O would \n To God I never had beene borne. Yit least that Candy should \n Not bring foorth all that monstruous were, the daughter of the Sonne \n Did love a Bull. Howbee't there was a Male to dote uppon. \n My love is furiouser than hers, if truthe confessed bee. \n For shee was fond of such a lust as myght bee compast. Shee \n Was served by a Bull beguyld by Art in Cow of tree. \n And one there was for her with whom advowtrie to commit. \n If all the conning in the worlde and slyghts of suttle wit \n Were heere, or if that Daedalus himselfe with uncowth wing \n Of Wax should hither fly againe, what comfort should he bring? \n Could he with all his conning crafts now make a boay of mee? \n Or could he, O Ianthee, chaunge the native shape of thee? \n Nay rather, Iphys, settle thou thy mynd and call thy witts \n Abowt thee: shake thou off theis flames that foolishly by fitts \n Without all reason reigne. Thou seest what Nature hathe thee made \n (Onlesse thow wilt deceyve thy selfe.) So farre foorth wysely wade, \n As ryght and reason may support, and love as women ought. \n Hope is the thing that breedes desyre, hope feedes the amorous thought. \n This hope thy sex denieth thee. Not watching doth restreyne \n Thee from embracing of the thing wherof thou art so fayne. \n Nor yit the Husbands jealowsie, nor rowghnesse of her Syre , \n Nor yit the coynesse of the Wench dooth hinder thy desyre. \n And yit thou canst not her enjoy. No, though that God and man \n Should labor to their uttermost and doo the best they can \n In thy behalfe, they could not make a happy wyght of thee. \n I cannot wish the thing but that I have it. Frank and free \n The Goddes have given mee what they could. As I will, so will bee \n That must become my fathrinlaw. So willes my father, too. \n But nature stronger than them all consenteth not thereto. \n This hindreth mee, and nothing else. Behold the blisfull tyme, \n The day of Mariage is at hand. Ianthee shalbee myne, \n And yit I shall not her enjoy. Amid the water wee \n Shall thirst. O Juno, president of mariage, why with thee \n Comes Hymen to this wedding where no brydegroome you shall see, \n But bothe are Brydes that must that day togither coupled bee?\n\n \n",

And the tyme shall come ere many yeeres bee spent, \n That in thy flowre a valeant Prince shall joyne himself with thee, \n And leave his name uppon the leaves for men to reede and see. \n Whyle Phoebus thus did prophesie, behold the blood of him \n Which dyde the grasse, ceast blood to bee, and up there sprang a trim \n And goodly flowre, more orient than the Purple cloth ingrayne, \n In shape a Lillye, were it not that Lillyes doo remayne \n Of sylver colour, whereas theis of purple hew are seene. \n Although that Phoebus had the cause of this greate honor beene, \n Yit thought he not the same ynough. And therfore did he wryght \n His syghes uppon the leaves thereof: and so in colour bryght \n The flowre hath a writ theron, which letters are of greef. \n So small the Spartanes thought the birth of Hyacinth repreef \n Unto them, that they woorship him from that day unto this. \n And as their fathers did before, so they doe never misse \n With solemne pomp to celebrate his feast from yeere to yeere.\n\n \n",

He layd her in a bed \n The which with scarlet dyde in Tyre was richly overspred, \n And terming her his bedfellow, he couched downe hir head \n Uppon a pillow soft, as though shee could have felt the same. \n The feast of Venus hallowed through the Ile of Cyprus , came \n And Bullocks whyght with gilden homes were slayne for sacrifyse, \n And up to heaven of frankincence the smoky fume did ryse. \n When as Pygmalion having doone his dutye that same day, \n Before the altar standing, thus with fearefull hart did say: \n If that you Goddes can all things give, then let my wife (I pray) \n (He durst not say bee yoon same wench of Ivory, but) bee leeke \n My wench of Ivory. Venus (who was nought at all to seeke \n What such a wish as that did meene) then present at her feast, \n For handsell of her freendly helpe did cause three tymes at least \n The fyre to kindle and to spyre thryse upward in the ayre. \n As soone as he came home, streyghtway Pygmalion did repayre \n Unto the Image of his wench, and leaning on the bed, \n Did kisse hir. In her body streyght a warmenesse seemd to spred. \n He put his mouth againe to hers, and on her brest did lay \n His hand. The Ivory wexed soft: and putting quyght away \n All hardnesse, yeelded underneathe his fingars, as wee see \n A peece of wax made soft ageinst the Sunne , or drawen to bee \n In divers shapes by chaufing it betweene ones handes, and so \n To serve to uses. He amazde stood wavering to and fro \n Tweene joy, and feare to be beeguyld, ageine he burnt in love, \n Ageine with feeling he began his wished hope to prove. \n He felt it verrye flesh in deede. By laying on his thumb, \n He felt her pulses beating. Then he stood no longer dumb \n But thanked Venus with his hart, and at the length he layd \n His mouth to hers who was as then become a perfect mayd. \n Shee felt the kisse, and blusht therat: and lifting fearefully \n Hir eyelidds up, hir Lover and the light at once did spye. \n The mariage that her selfe had made the Goddesse blessed so, \n That when the Moone with fulsum lyght nyne tymes her course had go, \n This Ladye was delivered of a Sun that Paphus hyght, \n Of whom the Iland takes that name. \n\n",
            "5":"\n\n Of him was borne a knyght \n Calld Cinyras who (had he had none issue) surely myght \n Of all men underneathe the sun beene thought the happyest wyght. \n Of wicked and most cursed things to speake I now commence. \n Yee daughters and yee parents all go get yee farre from hence. \n Or if yee mynded bee to heere my tale, beleeve mee nought \n In this beehalfe: ne think that such a thing was ever wrought. \n Or if yee will beeleeve the deede, beleeve the vengeance too \n Which lyghted on the partye that the wicked act did doo. \n But if that it be possible that any wyght so much \n From nature should degenerate, as for to fall to such \n A heynous cryme as this is, I am glad for Thracia , I \n Am glad for this same world of ours, yea glad exceedingly \n I am for this my native soyle, for that there is such space \n Betweene it and the land that bred a chyld so voyd of grace. \n I would the land Panchaya should of Amomie be rich, \n And Cinnamom, and Costus sweete, and Incence also which \n Dooth issue largely out of trees, and other flowers straunge, \n As long as that it beareth Myrrhe: not woorth it was the chaunge, \n Newe trees to have of such a pryce. The God of love denyes \n His weapons to have hurted thee, O Myrrha, and he tryes \n Himselfe ungiltie by thy fault. One of the Furies three \n With poysonde Snakes and hellish brands hath rather blasted thee. \n To hate ones father is a cryme as heynous as may bee, \n But yit more wicked is this love of thine than any hate. \n The youthfull Lordes of all the East and Peeres of cheef estate \n Desyre to have thee to their wyfe, and earnest sute doo make. \n Of all (excepting onely one) thy choyce, O Myrrha, take. \n Shee feeles her filthye love, and stryves ageinst it, and within \n Herself sayd: Whither roonnes my mynd? what thinke I to begin? \n Yee Gods (I pray) and godlynesse, yee holy rites and awe \n Of parents, from this heynous cryme my vicious mynd withdrawe, \n And disappoynt my wickednesse. At leastwyse if it bee \n A wickednesse that I intend. As farre as I can see, \n This love infrindgeth not the bondes of godlynesse a whit. \n For every other living wyght dame nature dooth permit \n To match without offence of sin. The Heifer thinkes no shame \n To beare her father on her backe: the horse bestrydes the same \n Of whom he is the syre: the Gote dooth bucke the kid that hee \n Himself begate: and birdes doo tread the selfsame birdes wee see \n Of whom they hatched were before. In happye cace they are \n That may doo so without offence. But mans malicious care \n Hath made a brydle for it self, and spyghtfull lawes restreyne \n The things that nature setteth free. Yit are their Realmes (men sayne) \n In which the moother with the sonne, and daughter with the father \n Doo match, wherethrough of godlynesse the bond augments the rather \n With doubled love. Now wo is mee it had not beene my lot \n In that same countrie to bee borne. And that this lucklesse plot \n Should hinder mee. Why thinke I thus? Avaunt, unlawfull love. \n I ought to love him, I confesse: but so as dooth behove \n His daughter: were not Cinyras my father than, Iwis \n I myght obtaine to lye with him. But now bycause he is \n Myne owne, he cannot bee myne owne. The neerenesse of our kin \n Dooth hurt me. Were I further off perchaunce I more myght win. \n And if I wist that I therby this wickednesse myght shunne, \n I would forsake my native soyle and farre from Cyprus runne. \n This evill heate dooth hold mee backe, that beeing present still \n I may but talke with Cinyras and looke on him my fill, \n And touch, and kisse him, if no more may further graunted bee. \n Why wicked wench, and canst thou hope for further? doost not see \n How by thy fault thou doost confound the ryghts of name and kin? \n And wilt thou make thy mother bee a Cucqueane by thy sin? \n Wilt thou thy fathers leman bee? wilt thou bee both the moother \n And suster of thy chyld? shall he bee both thy sonne and brother? \n And standst thou not in feare at all of those same susters three \n Whose heads with crawling snakes in stead of heare bematted bee? \n Which pushing with theyr cruell bronds folks eyes and mouthes, doo see \n Theyr sinfull harts? but thou now whyle thy body yit is free, \n Let never such a wickednesse once enter in thy mynd. \n Defyle not myghtye natures hest by lust ageinst thy kynd. \n What though thy will were fully bent? yit even the very thing \n Is such as will not suffer thee the same to end to bring. \n For why he beeing well disposde and godly, myndeth ay \n So much his dewtye that from ryght and truth he will not stray. \n Would Godlyke furie were in him as is in mee this day. \n This sayd, her father Cinyras (who dowted what to doo \n By reason of the worthy store of suters which did woo \n His daughter,) bringing all theyr names did will her for to show \n On which of them shee had herself most fancie to bestow. \n At first shee hild her peace a whyle, and looking wistly on \n Her fathers face, did boyle within: and scalding teares anon \n Ran downe her visage. Cyniras, (who thought them to proceede \n Of tender harted shamefastnesse) did say there was no neede \n Of teares, and dryed her cheekes, and kist her. Myrrha tooke of it \n Exceeding pleasure in her selfe: and when that he did wit \n What husband shee did wish to have, shee sayd: One like to yow. \n He undertanding not hir thought, did well her woordes allow, \n And sayd: In this thy godly mynd continew. At the name \n Of godlynesse, shee cast mee downe her looke for very shame. \n For why her giltie hart did knowe shee well deserved blame. \n Hygh mydnight came, and sleepe bothe care and carkesses opprest. \n But Myrrha lying brode awake could neyther sleepe nor rest. \n Shee fryes in Cupids flames, and woorkes continewally uppon \n Her furious love. One while shee sinkes in deepe despayre. Anon \n Shee fully myndes to give attempt, but shame doth hold her in. \n Shee wishes and shee wotes not what to doo, nor how to gin. \n And like as when a mightye tree with axes heawed rownd, \n Now redy with a strype or twaine to lye uppon the grownd, \n Uncerteine is which way to fall and tottreth every way: \n Even so her mynd with dowtfull wound effeebled then did stray \n Now heere now there uncerteinely, and tooke of bothe encreace. \n No measure of her love was found, no rest, nor yit releace, \n Save only death. Death likes her best. Shee ryseth, full in mynd \n To hang herself. About a post her girdle she doth bynd, \n And sayd: Farewell deere Cinyras, and understand the cause \n Of this my death. And with that woord about her necke shee drawes \n The nooze. Her trustye nurce that in another Chamber lay \n By fortune heard the whispring sound of theis her woordes (folk say). \n The aged woman rysing up unboltes the doore. And whan \n Shee saw her in that plyght of death, shee shreeking out began \n To smyght her self, and scratcht her brest, and quickly to her ran \n And rent the girdle from her necke. Then weeping bitterly \n And holding her betweene her armes, shee askt the question why \n Shee went about to hang her self so unadvisedly. \n The Lady hilld her peace as dumb, and looking on the ground \n Unmovably, was sorye in her hart for beeing found \n Before shee had dispatcht herself. Her nurce still at her lay, \n And shewing her her emptie dugges and naked head all gray, \n Besought her for the paynes shee tooke with her both night and day \n In rocking and in feeding her, shee would vouchsafe to say \n What ere it were that greeved her. The Ladye turnd away \n Displeasde and fetcht a sygh. The nurce was fully bent in mynd \n To bowlt the matter out: for which not onely shee did bynd \n Her fayth, in secret things to keepe: but also sayd, put mee \n In truth to fynd a remedye. I am not (thou shalt see) \n Yit altogither dulld by age. If furiousenesse it bee, \n I have bothe charmes and chaunted herbes to help. If any wyght \n Bewitcheth thee, by witchcraft I will purge and set thee quyght. \n Or if it bee the wrath of God, we shall with sacrifyse \n Appease the wrath of God right well. What may I more surmyse? \n No theeves have broken in uppon this house and spoyld the welth. \n Thy mother and thy father bothe are living and in helth. \n When Myrrha heard her father naamd, a greevous sygh she fet \n Even from the bottom of her hart. Howbee't the nurce as yet \n Misdeemd not any wickednesse. But nerethelesse shee gest \n There was some love: and standing in one purpose made request \n To breake her mynd unto her, and shee set her tenderly \n Uppon her lappe. The Ladye wept and sobbed bitterly. \n Then culling her in feeble armes, shee sayd: I well espye \n Thou art in love. My diligence in this behalf I sweare \n Shall servisable to thee bee. Thou shalt not neede to feare \n That ere thy father shall it knowe. At that same woord shee lept \n From nurces lappe like one that had beene past her witts, and stept \n With fury to her bed. At which shee leaning downe hir face \n Sayd: Hence I pray thee: force mee not to shewe my shamefull cace. \n And when the nurce did urge her still, shee answered eyther: Get \n Thee hence, or ceace to aske mee why myself I thus doo fret. \n The thing that thou desyrste to knowe is wickednesse. The old \n Poore nurce gan quake, and trembling both for age and feare did hold \n Her handes to her. And kneeling downe right humbly at her feete, \n One whyle shee fayre intreated her with gentle woordes and sweete. \n Another whyle (onlesse shee made her privie of her sorrow) \n Shee threatned her, and put her in a feare shee would next morrow \n Bewray her how shee went about to hang herself. But if \n Shee told her, shee did plyght her fayth and help to her releef. \n Shee lifted up her head, and then with teares fast gushing out \n Beesloobered all her nurces brest: and going oft about \n To speake, shee often stayd: and with her garments hid her face \n For shame, and lastly sayd: O happye is my moothers cace \n That such a husband hath. With that a greevous sygh shee gave, \n And hilld her peace. Theis woordes of hers a trembling chilnesse drave \n In nurcis limbes, which perst her bones: (for now shee understood \n The cace) and all her horye heare up stiffly staring stood \n And many things she talkt to put away her cursed love, \n If that it had beene possible the madnesse to remove. \n The Mayd herself to be full trew the councell dooth espye: \n Yit if shee may not have her love shee fully myndes to dye. \n Live still (quoth nurce) thou shalt obteine (shee durst not say thy father, \n But stayd at that). And forbycause that Myrrha should the rather \n Beleeve her, shee confirmd her woordes by othe. The yeerely feast \n Of gentle Ceres came, in which the wyves bothe moste and least \n Appareld all in whyght are woont the firstlings of the feeld, \n Fyne garlonds made of eares of come, to Ceres for to yeeld. \n And for the space of thryce three nyghts they counted it a sin \n To have the use of any man, or once to towche his skin. \n Among theis women did the Queene freequent the secret rites. \n Now whyle that of his lawfull wyfe his bed was voyd a nightes, \n The nurce was dooble diligent: and fynding Cinyras \n Well washt with wyne, shee did surmyse there was a pretye lasse \n In love with him. And hyghly shee her beawty setteth out. \n And beeing asked of her yeeres, she sayd shee was about \n The age of Myrrha. Well (quoth he) then bring her to my bed. \n Returning home she sayd: bee glad my nurcechilde: we have sped. \n Not all so wholly in her hart was wretched Myrrha glad, \n But that her fore misgiving mynd did also make her sad. \n Howbee't shee also did rejoyce as in a certaine kynd, \n Such discord of affections was within her combred mynd. \n It was the tyme that all things rest. And now Bootes bryght, \n The driver of the Oxen seven, about the northpole pyght \n Had sumwhat turnd his wayne asyde, when wicked Myrrha sped \n About her buysnesse. Out of heaven the golden Phoebee fled. \n With clowds more black than any pitch the starres did hyde their hed. \n The nyght beecommeth utter voyd of all her woonted lyght. \n And first before all other hid their faces out of syght \n Good Icar and Erigonee, his daughter, who for love \n Most vertuous to her fatherward, was taken up above \n And made a starre in heaven. Three tymes had Myrrha warning given \n By stumbling, to retyre. Three tymes the deathfull Owle that eeven \n With doolefull noyse prognosticates unhappie lucke. Yet came \n Shee forward still: the darknesse of the nyght abated shame. \n Her left hand held her nurce, her right the darke blynd way did grope. \n Anon shee to the chamber came: anon the doore was ope: \n Anon she entred in. With that her foltring hammes did quake: \n Her colour dyde: her blood and hart did cleerly her forsake. \n The neerer shee approched to her wickednesse, the more \n She trembled: of her enterpryse it irked her full sore: \n And fayne shee would shee might unknowen have turned back. Nurce led \n Her pawsing forward by the hand: and putting her to bed, \n Heere, take this Damzell, Cinyras, shee is thine owne, shee sed. \n And so shee layd them brest to brest. The wicked father takes \n His bowelles into filthy bed, and there with wordes asslakes \n The maydens feare, and cheeres her up. And lest this cryme of theyres \n Myght want the ryghtfull termes, by chaunce as in respect of yeeres \n He daughter did hir call, and shee him father. Beeing sped \n With cursed seede in wicked womb, shee left her fathers bed, \n Of which soone after shee became greate bagged with her shame. \n Next night the lewdnesse doubled. And no end was of the same, \n Untill at length that Cinyras desyrous for to knowe \n His lover that so many nyghts uppon him did bestowe, \n Did fetch a light: by which he sawe his owne most heynous cryme, \n And eeke his daughter. Nathelesse, his sorrow at that time \n Represt his speeche. Then hanging by he drew a Rapier bryght. \n Away ran Myrrha, and by meanes of darknesse of the nyght \n Shee was delivered from the death: and straying in the broade \n Datebearing feeldes of Arabye, shee through Panchaya yode, \n And wandring full nyne moonethes at length shee rested beeing tyrde \n In Saba land. And when the tyme was neere at hand expyrde, \n And that uneath the burthen of her womb shee well could beare, \n Not knowing what she might desyre, distrest betweene the feare \n Of death, and tediousnesse of lyfe, this prayer shee did make: \n O Goddes, if of repentant folk you any mercye take, \n Sharpe vengeance I confesse I have deserved, and content \n I am to take it paciently. How bee it to th'entent \n That neyther with my lyfe the quick, nor with my death the dead \n Anoyed bee, from both of them exempt mee this same sted, \n And altring mee, deny to mee both lyfe and death. We see \n To such as doo confesse theyr faults sum mercy shewd to bee. \n The Goddes did graunt her this request, the last that she should make. \n The ground did overgrow hir feete, and ancles as she spake. \n And from her bursten toes went rootes, which wrything heere and there \n Did fasten so the trunk within the ground shee could not steare. \n Her bones did into timber turne, whereof the marie was \n The pith, and into watrish sappe the blood of her did passe. \n Her armes were turnd to greater boughes, her fingars into twig, \n Her skin was hardned into bark. And now her belly big \n The eatching tree had overgrowen, and overtane her brest, \n And hasted for to win her neck, and hyde it with the rest. \n Shee made no taryence nor delay, but met the comming tree, \n And shroonk her face within the barke therof. Although that shee \n Togither with her former shape her senses all did loose, \n Yit weepeth shee, and from her tree warme droppes doo softly woose. \n The which her teares are had in pryce and honour. And the Myrrhe \n That issueth from her gummy bark dooth beare the name of her, \n And shall doo whyle the world dooth last. The misbegotten chyld \n Grew still within the tree, and from his mothers womb defyld \n Sought meanes to bee delyvered. Her burthende womb did swell \n Amid the tree, and stretcht her out. But woordes wherwith to tell \n And utter foorth her greef did want. She had no use of speech \n With which Lucina in her throwes shee might of help beseech. \n Yit like a woman labring was the tree, and bowwing downe \n Gave often sighes, and shed foorth teares as though shee there should drowne. \n Lucina to this wofull tree came gently downe, and layd \n Her hand theron, and speaking woordes of ease the midwife playd. \n The tree did cranye, and the barke deviding made away, \n And yeelded out the chyld alyve, which cryde and wayld streyght way. \n The waternymphes uppon the soft sweete hearbes the chyld did lay, \n And bathde him with his mothers teares. His face was such as spyght \n Must needes have praysd. For such he was in all condicions right, \n As are the naked Cupids that in tables picturde bee. \n But to th'entent he may with them in every poynt agree, \n Let eyther him bee furnisshed with wings and quiver light, \n Or from the Cupids take theyr wings and bowes and arrowes quight. \n\n \n",
            "6":"\n\n Away slippes fleeting tyme unspyde and mocks us to our face, \n And nothing may compare with yeares in swiftnesse of theyr pace. \n That wretched imp whom wickedly his graundfather begate, \n And whom his cursed suster bare, who hidden was alate \n Within the tree, and lately borne, became immediatly \n The beawtyfullyst babe on whom man ever set his eye. \n Anon a stripling hee became, and by and by a man, \n And every day more beawtifull than other he becam, \n That in the end Dame Venus fell in love with him: wherby \n He did revenge the outrage of his mothers villanye. \n For as the armed Cupid kist Dame Venus, unbeware \n An arrow sticking out did raze hir brest uppon the bare. \n The Goddesse being wounded, thrust away her sonne. The wound \n Appeered not to bee so deepe as afterward was found. \n It did deceyve her at the first. The beawty of the lad \n Nor unto Paphos where the sea beats round about the shore, \n Inflaamd her. To Cythera Ile no mynd at all shee had. \n Nor fisshy Gnyde, nor Amathus that hath of metalls store. \n Yea even from heaven shee did absteyne. Shee lovd Adonis more \n Than heaven. To him shee clinged ay, and bare him companye. \n And in the shadowe woont shee was to rest continually, \n And for to set her beawtye out most seemely to the eye \n By trimly decking of her self. Through bushy grounds and groves, \n And over Hills and Dales, and Lawnds and stony rocks shee roves, \n Bare kneed with garment tucked up according to the woont \n Of Phebe, and shee cheerd the hounds with hallowing like a hunt, \n Pursewing game of hurtlesse sort, as Hares made lowe before, \n Or stagges with loftye heades, or bucks. But with the sturdy Boare \n And ravening woolf, and Bearewhelpes armd with ugly pawes, and eeke \n The cruell Lyons which delyght in blood, and slaughter seeke, \n Shee meddled not. And of theis same shee warned also thee, \n Adonis, for to shoonne them, if thou wooldst have warned bee. \n Bee bold on cowards (Venus sayd) for whoso dooth advaunce \n Himselfe against the bold, may hap to meete with sum mischaunce. \n Wherfore I pray thee, my sweete boy, forbeare too bold to bee. \n For feare thy rashnesse hurt thy self and woork the wo of me \n Encounter not the kynd of beastes whom nature armed hath, \n For dowt thou buy thy prayse too deere procuring thee sum scath. \n Thy tender youth, thy beawty bryght, thy countnance fayre and brave \n Although they had the force to win the hart of Venus, have \n No powre ageinst the Lyons , nor ageinst the bristled swyne. \n The eyes and harts of savage beasts doo nought to theis inclyne. \n The cruell Boares beare thunder in theyr hooked tushes, and \n Exceeding force and feercenesse is in Lyons to withstand. \n And sure I hate them at my hart. To him demaunding why, \n A monstrous chaunce (quoth Venus) I will tell thee by and by, \n That hapned for a fault. But now unwoonted toyle hath made \n Mee weerye: and beholde, in tyme this Poplar with his shade \n Allureth, and the ground for cowch dooth serve to rest uppon. \n I prey thee let us rest us here. They sate them downe anon. \n And lying upward with her head uppon his lappe along, \n Shee thus began, and in her tale shee bussed him among:\n\n \n",
            "7":"\n\n Perchaunce thou hast or this tyme heard of one that overcame \n The swiftest men in footemanshippe. No fable was that fame. \n She overcame them out of dowt. And hard it is to tell \n Thee whither she did in footemanshippe or beawty more excell. \n Uppon a season as she askt of Phebus, what he was \n That should her husband bee, he sayd: For husband doo not passe, \n O Atalanta, thou at all of husband hast no neede. \n Shonne husbanding. But yit thou canst not shonne it, I thee reede. \n Alyve thou shalt not be thy self. Shee being sore afrayd \n Of this Apollos Oracle, did keepe herself a mayd, \n And lived in the shady woodes. When wooers to her came, \n And were of her importunate, shee drave away the same \n With boystous woordes, and with the sore condition of the game. \n I am not to be had (quoth shee) onlesse yee able bee \n In ronning for to vanquish mee. Yee must contend with mee \n In footemanshippe. And who so winnes the wager, I agree \n To bee his wife. But if that he bee found too slowe, then hee \n Shall lose his head. This of your game the verrye law shall bee. \n Shee was in deede unmercifull. But such is beawties powre, \n That though the sayd condition were extreme and over sowre, \n Yit many suters were so rash to undertake the same. \n Hippomenes as a looker on of this uncurteous game, \n Sate by, and sayd: Is any man so mad to seeke a wyfe \n With such apparant perill and the hazard of his lyfe? \n And utterly he did condemne the yongmens love. But when \n He saw her face and bodye bare, (for why the Lady then \n Did strippe her to her naked skin) the which was like to myne, \n Or rather (if that thou wert made a woman) like to thyne: \n He was amazde. And holding up his hands to heaven, he sayth: \n Forgive mee you with whom I found such fault even now: in fayth \n I did not know the wager that yee ran for. As hee prayseth \n The beawty of her, in himselfe the fyre of love he rayseth. \n And through an envy fearing lest shee should away be woonne, \n He wisht that nere a one of them so swift as shee might roonne. \n And wherfore (quoth hee) put not I myself in preace to trye \n The fortune of this wager? God himself continually \n Dooth help the bold and hardye sort. Now whyle Hippomenes \n Debates theis things within himselfe and other like to these, \n The Damzell ronnes as if her feete were wings. And though that shee \n Did fly as swift as arrow from a Turkye bowe: yit hee \n More woondred at her beawtye than at swiftnesse of her pace. \n Her ronning greatly did augment her beawtye and her grace. \n The wynd ay whisking from her feete the labells of her socks \n Uppon her back as whyght as snowe did tosse her golden locks, \n And eeke th'embroydred garters that were tyde beneathe her ham. \n A rednesse mixt with whyght uppon her tender bodye cam, \n As when a scarlet curtaine streynd ageinst a playstred wall \n Dooth cast like shadowe, making it seeme ruddye therwithall. \n Now whyle he straunger noted this, the race was fully ronne, \n And Atalant (as shee that had the wager cleerely wonne) \n Was crowned with a garlond brave. The vanquisht sighing sore, \n Did lose theyr lyves according to agreement made before. \n Howbeeit nought at all dismayd with theis mennes lucklesse cace \n He stepped foorth, and looking full uppon the maydens face, \n Sayd: Wherfore doost thou seeke renowne in vanquisshing of such \n As were but dastards? Cope with mee. If fortune bee so much \n My freend to give mee victorie, thou needest not hold scorne \n To yeeld to such a noble man as I am. I am borne \n The sonne of noble Megaree, Onchestyes sonne, and hee \n Was sonne to Neptune. Thus am I great graundchyld by degree \n In ryght descent, of him that rules the waters.

Thou straunger hence therfore. \n Away, I say, now whyle thou mayst, and shonne my bloody bed. \n My mariage cruell is, and craves the losing of thy hed. \n There is no wench but that would such a husband gladly catch. \n And shee that wyse were myght desyre to meete with such a match. \n But why now after heading of so many, doo I care \n For thee? Looke thou to that. For sith so many men as are \n Alreadye put to slawghter can not warne thee to beeware, \n But that thou wilt bee weerye of thy lyfe, dye: doo not spare. \n And shall he perrish then bycause he sought to live with mee? \n And for his love unwoorthely wvith death rewarded bee? \n All men of such a victory will speake too foule a shame. \n But all the world can testifye that I am not to blame. \n Would God thou wouldst desist. Or else bycause thou are so mad, \n I would to God a little more thy feete of swiftnesse had. \n Ah what a maydens countenance is in this chyldish face. \n Ah, foolish boy Hippomenes, how wretched is thy cace. \n I would thou never hadst mee seene.

Then Neptunes issue prayd \n With carefull hart and voyce to mee, and thus devoutly sayd: \n O Venus, favour myne attempt, and send mee downe thyne ayd \n To compasse my desyred love which thou hast on mee layd. \n His prayer movd mee (I confesse,) and long I not delayd \n Before I helpt him. Now there is a certaine feeld the which \n The Cyprian folk call Damasene, most fertile and most rich \n Of all the Cyprian feelds: the same was consecrate to mee \n In auncient tyme, and of my Church the glebland woont to bee. \n Amid this feeld, with golden leaves there growes a goodly tree \n The crackling boughes whereof are all of yellew gold. I came \n And gathered golden Apples three: and bearing thence the same \n Within my hand, immediatly to Hippomen I gat \n Invisible to all wyghts else save him and taught him what \n To doo with them. \n\n \n",

But rash \n And heady ryot out of frame all reason now did dash, \n And frantik outrage reigned. Yit had the sweetenesse of his song \n Appeasd all weapons, saving that the noyse now growing strong \n With blowing shalmes, and beating drummes, and bedlem howling out, \n And clapping hands on every syde by Bacchus drunken rout, \n Did drowne the sownd of Orphyes harp. Then first of all stones were \n Made ruddy with the prophets blood, and could not give him eare. \n And first the flocke of Bacchus froes by violence brake the ring \n Of Serpents, birds, and savage beastes that for to heere him sing \n Sate gazing round about him there. And then with bluddy hands \n They ran uppon the prophet who among them singing stands. \n They flockt about him like as when a sort of birds have found \n An Owle a daytymes in a tod: and hem him in full round, \n As when a Stag by hungrye hownds is in a morning found, \n The which forestall him round about and pull him to the ground. \n Even so the prophet they assayle, and throwe their Thyrses greene \n At him, which for another use than that invented beene. \n Sum cast mee clods, sum boughes of trees, and sum threw stones. And lest \n That weapons wherwithall to wreake theyr woodnesse which increast \n Should want, it chaunst that Oxen by were tilling of the ground \n And labring men with brawned armes not farre fro thence were found \n A digging of the hardned earth, and earning of theyr food, \n With sweating browes. They seeing this same rout, no longer stood, \n But ran away and left theyr tooles behynd them.

Right glad of that was hee, \n But not a whit at latter end the better should he bee. \n He minding to misuse his giftes, sayd: Graunt that all and some \n The which my body towcheth bare may yellow gold become. \n God Bacchus graunting his request, his hurtfull gift performd, \n And that he had not better wisht he in his stomacke stormd. \n Rejoycing in his harme away full merye goes the king: \n And for to try his promis true he towcheth every thing. \n Scarce giving credit to himself, he pulled yoong greene twiggs \n From off an Holmetree: by and by all golden were the spriggs. \n He tooke a flintstone from the ground, the stone likewyse became \n Pure gold. He towched next a clod of earth, and streight the same \n By force of towching did become a wedge of yellow gold. \n He gathered eares of rypened come: immediatly beholde \n The come was gold. An Apple then he pulled from a tree: \n Yee would have thought the Hesperids had given it him. If hee \n On Pillars high his fingars layd, they glistred like the sonne. \n The water where he washt his hands did from his hands so ronne, \n As Danae might have beene therwith beguyld. He scarce could hold \n His passing joyes within his harr, for making all things gold. \n Whyle he thus joyd, his officers did spred the boord anon, \n And set downe sundry sorts of meate and mancheate theruppon. \n Then whither his hand did towch the bread, the bread was massy gold: \n Or whither he chawde with hungry teeth his meate, yee might behold \n The peece of meate betweene his jawes a plat of gold to bee. \n In drinking wine and water mixt, yee myght discerne and see \n The liquid gold ronne downe his throte. Amazed at the straunge \n Mischaunce, and being both a wretch and rich, he wisht to chaunge \n His riches for his former state, and now he did abhorre \n The thing which even but late before he cheefly longed for. \n No meate his hunger slakes: his throte is shrunken up with thurst: \n And justly dooth his hatefull gold torment him as accurst. \n Then lifting up his sory armes and handes to heaven, he cryde: \n O father Bacchus, pardon mee. My sinne I will not hyde. \n Have mercy, I beseech thee, and vouchsauf to rid mee quyght \n From this same harme that seemes so good and glorious unto syght. \n The gentle Bacchus streight uppon confession of his cryme \n Restored Midas to the state hee had in former tyme. \n And having made performance of his promis, hee beereft him \n The gift that he had graunted him. And lest he should have left him \n Beedawbed with the dregges of that same gold which wickedly \n Hee wished had, he willed him to get him by and by \n To that great ryver which dooth ronne by Sardis towne, and there \n Along the chanell up the streame his open armes to beare \n Untill he commeth to the spring: and then his head to put \n Full underneathe the foming spowt where greatest was the gut, \n And so in washing of his limbes to wash away his cryme. \n The king (as was commaunded him) ageinst the streame did clyme. \n And streyght the powre of making gold departing quyght from him, \n Infects the ryver, making it with golden streame to swim. \n The force whereof the bankes about so soked in theyr veynes, \n That even as yit the yellow gold uppon the cloddes remaynes.\n\n \n",

But yit his Barber who \n Was woont to notte him spyed it: and beeing eager to \n Disclose it, when he neyther durst to utter it, nor could \n It keepe in secret still, he went and digged up the mowld, \n And whispring softly in the pit, declaard what eares hee spyde \n His mayster have, and turning downe the clowre ageine, did hyde \n His blabbed woordes within the ground, and closing up the pit \n Departed thence and never made mo woordes at all of it. \n Soone after, there began a tuft of quivering reedes to growe \n Which beeing rype bewrayd theyr seede and him that did them sowe. \n For when the gentle sowtherne wynd did lyghtly on them blowe, \n They uttred foorth the woordes that had beene buried in the ground \n And so reprovde the Asses eares of Midas with theyr sound.\n\n \n",

Onely of his crime no woord hee spake, \n But of his flyght another cause pretensedly did make: \n Desyring leave within his towne or countrye to abyde. \n The king of Trachin gently thus to him ageine replyde: \n Our bownty to the meanest sort (O Peleus) dooth extend: \n Wee are not woont the desolate our countrye to forfend. \n And though I bee of nature most inclyned good to doo: \n Thyne owne renowme, thy graundsyre Jove are forcements thereunto. \n Misspend no longer tyme in sute. I gladly doo agree \n To graunt thee what thou wilt desyre. Theis things that thou doost see \n I would thou should account them as thyne owne, such as they bee \n I would they better were. With that he weeped. Peleus and \n His freends desyred of his greef the cause to understand. \n He answerd thus: Perchaunce yee think this bird that lives by pray \n And putts all other birds in feare had wings and fethers ay. \n He was a man. And as he was right feerce in feats of armes, \n And stout and readye bothe to wreake and also offer harmes: \n So was he of a constant mynd. Daedalion men him hyght. \n Our father was that noble starre that brings the morning bryght, \n And in the welkin last of all gives place to Phebus lyght. \n My study was to maynteine peace, in peace was my delyght, \n And for to keepe mee true to her to whom my fayth is plyght. \n My brother had felicite in warre and bloody fyght. \n His prowesse and his force which now dooth chase in cruell flyght \n The Dooves of Thisbye since his shape was altred thus anew, \n Ryght puyssant Princes and theyr Realmes did heeretofore subdew. \n He had a chyld calld Chyone, whom nature did endew \n With beawtye so, that when to age of fowreteene yeeres shee grew, \n A thousand Princes liking her did for hir favour sew. \n By fortune as bryght Phebus and the sonne of Lady May \n Came t'one from Delphos , toother from mount Cyllen, by the way \n They saw her bothe at once, and bothe at once were tane in love. \n Apollo till the tyme of nyght differd his sute to move. \n But Hermes could not beare delay. He stroked on the face \n The mayden with his charmed rod which hath the powre to chace \n And bring in sleepe: the touch whereof did cast her in so dead \n A sleepe, that Hermes by and by his purpose of her sped. \n As soone as nyght with twinckling starres the welkin had beesprent, \n Apollo in an old wyves shape to Chyon clocely went, \n And tooke the pleasure which the sonne of Maya had forehent. \n Now when shee full her tyme had gone, shee bare by Mercurye \n A sonne that hyght Awtolychus, who provde a wyly pye, \n And such a fellow as in theft and filching had no peere. \n He was his fathers owne sonne right: he could mennes eyes so bleere, \n As for to make the black things whyghlt, and whyght things black appeere. \n And by Apollo (for shee bare a payre) was borne his brother \n Philammon, who in musick arte excelled farre all other, \n As well in singing as in play. But what avayled it \n To beare such twinnes, and of two Goddes in favour to have sit? \n And that shee to her father had a stowt and valeant knight, \n Or that her graundsyre was the sonne of Jove that God of might? \n Dooth glorie hurt to any folk? It surely hurted her. \n For standing in her owne conceyt shee did herself prefer \n Before Diana , and dispraysd her face, who there with all \n Inflaamd with wrath, sayd: Well, with deedes we better please her shall. \n Immediatly shee bent her bowe, and let an arrow go, \n Which strake her through the toong, whose spight deserved \n wounding so. \n Her toong wext dumb, her speech gan fayle that erst was over ryfe, \n And as shee stryved for to speake, away went blood and lyfe. \n How wretched was I then, O God? how strake it to my hart? \n What woordes of comfort did I speake to ease my brothers smart? \n To which he gave his eare as much as dooth the stony rocke \n To hideous roring of the waves that doo against it knocke. \n There was no measure nor none ende in making of his mone, \n Nor in bewayling comfortlesse his daughter that was gone. \n But when he sawe her bodye burne, fowre tymes with all his myght \n He russhed foorth to thrust himself amid the fyre in spyght. \n Fowre tymes hee beeing thence repulst, did put himself to flyght. \n And ran mee wheras was no way, as dooth a Bullocke when \n A hornet stings him in the necke. Mee thought hee was as then \n More wyghter farre than any man. Yee would have thought his feete \n Had had sum wings. So fled he quyght from all, and being fleete \n Through eagernesse to dye, he gat to mount Parnasos knappe \n And there Apollo pitying him and rewing his missehappe, \n When as Daedalion from the cliffe himself had headlong floong, \n Transformd him to a bird, and on the soodaine as hee hung \n Did give him wings, and bowwing beake, and hooked talants keene, \n And eeke a courage full as feerce as ever it had beene. \n And furthermore a greater strength he lent him therwithall, \n Than one would thinke conveyd myght bee within a roome so small. \n And now in shape of Gossehawke hee to none indifferent is, \n But wreakes his teene on all birds. And bycause him selfe ere this \n Did feele the force of sorrowes sting within his wounded hart, \n Hee maketh others oftentymes to sorrow and to smart.\n\n \n",

            "7":"\n\n In this meane tyme the Trachine king sore vexed in his thought \n With signes that both before and since his brothers death were wrought, \n For counsell at the sacret Spelles (which are but toyes to foode \n Fond fancyes, and not counsellers in perill to doo goode) \n Did make him reedy to the God of Claros for to go. \n For heathenish Phorbas and the folk of Phlegia had as tho \n The way to Delphos stopt, that none could travell to or fro. \n But ere he on his journey went, he made his faythfull make \n Alcyone preevye to the thing. Immediatly theyr strake \n A chilnesse to her verry bones, and pale was all her face \n Like box and downe her heavy cheekes the teares did gush apace. \n Three times about to speake, three times shee washt her face with teares, \n And stinting oft with sobbes, shee thus complayned in his eares: \n What fault of myne, husband deere, hath turnd thy hart fro mee? \n Where is that care of mee that erst was woont to bee in thee? \n And canst thou having left thy deere Alcyone merrye bee? \n Doo journeyes long delyght thee now? dooth now myne absence please \n Thee better then my presence dooth? Think I that thou at ease \n Shalt go by land? Shall I have cause but onely for to moorne? \n And not to bee afrayd? And shall my care of thy returne \n Bee voyd of feare? No no. The sea mee sore afrayd dooth make. \n To think uppon the sea dooth cause my flesh for feare to quake. \n I sawe the broken ribbes of shippes alate uppon the shore. \n And oft on Tumbes I reade theyr names whose bodyes long before \n The sea had swallowed. Let not fond vayne hope seduce thy mynd, \n That Aeolus is thy fathrinlaw who holdes the boystous wynd \n In prison, and can calme the seas at pleasure. When the wynds \n Are once let looce uppon the sea, no order then them bynds. \n Then neyther land hathe priviledge, nor sea exemption fynds. \n Yea even the clowdes of heaven they vex, and with theyr meeting stout \n Enforce the fyre with hideous noyse to brust in flashes out. \n The more that I doo know them, (for ryght well I know theyr powre, \n And saw them oft a little wench within my fathers bowre) \n So much the more I think them to bee feard. But if thy will \n By no intreatance may bee turnd at home to tarry still, \n But that thou needes wilt go: then mee, deere husband, with thee take. \n So shall the sea us equally togither tosse and shake. \n So woorser than I feele I shall bee certeine not to feare. \n So shall we whatsoever happes togitherjoyntly beare. \n So shall wee on the broad mayne sea togither joyntly sayle. \n Theis woordes and teares wherewith the imp of Aeolus did assayle \n Her husbond borne of heavenly race, did make his hart relent. \n (For he lovd her no lesse than shee lovd him.) But fully bent \n He seemed, neyther for to leave the journey which he ment \n To take by sea, nor yit to give Alcyone leave as tho \n Companion of his perlous course by water for to go. \n He many woordes of comfort spake her feare away to chace. \n But nought hee could perswade therein to make her like the cace. \n This last asswagement of her greef he added in the end, \n Which was the onely thing that made her loving hart to bend: \n All taryance will assuredly seeme over long to mee. \n And by my fathers blasing beames I make my vow to thee \n That at the furthest ere the tyme (if God therto agree) \n The moone doo fill her circle twyce, ageine I will heere bee. \n When in sum hope of his returne this promis had her set, \n He willd a shippe immediatly from harbrough to bee fet, \n And throughly rigged for to bee, that neyther maast, nor sayle, \n Nor tackling, no nor other thing should apperteyning fayle. \n Which when Alcyone did behold, as one whoose hart misgave \n The happes at hand, shee quaakt ageine, and teares out gusshing drave. \n And streyning Ceyx in her armes with pale and piteous looke, \n Poore wretched soule, her last farewell at length shee sadly tooke, \n And swounded flat uppon the ground. Anon the watermen \n (As Ceyx sought delayes and was in dowt to turne agen) \n Set hand to Ores, of which there were two rowes on eyther syde, \n And all at once with equall stroke the swelling sea devyde. \n Shee lifting up her watrye eyes behilld her husband stand \n Uppon the hatches making signes by beckening with his hand: \n And shee made signes to him ageine. And after that the land \n Was farre removed from the shippe, and that the sight began \n To bee unable to discerne the face of any man, \n As long as ere shee could shee lookt uppon the rowing keele. \n And when shee could no longer tyme for distance ken it weele, \n Shee looked still uppon the sayles that flasked with the wynd \n Uppon the maast. And when shee could the sayles no longer fynd, \n She gate her to her empty bed with sad and sorye hart, \n And layd her downe. The chamber did renew afresh her smart, \n And of her bed did bring to mynd the deere departed part. \n From harbrough now they quyght were gone: and now a plasant gale \n Did blowe. The mayster made his men theyr Ores asyde to hale, \n And hoysed up the toppesayle on the hyghest of the maast, \n And clapt on all his other sayles bycause no wind should waast. \n Scarce full t'one half, (or sure not much above) the shippe had ronne \n Uppon the sea and every way the land did farre them shonne, \n When toward night the wallowing waves began to waxen whyght, \n And eeke the heady easterne wynd did blow with greater myght, \n Anon the Mayster cryed: Strike the toppesayle, let the mayne \n Sheate flye and fardle it to the yard. Thus spake he, but in vayne, \n For why so hideous was the storme uppon the soodeine brayd, \n That not a man was able there to heere what other sayd. \n And lowd the sea with meeting waves extreemely raging rores. \n Yit fell they to it of them selves. Sum haalde asyde the Ores: \n Sum fensed in the Gallyes sydes, sum downe the sayleclothes rend: \n Sum pump the water out, and sea to sea ageine doo send. \n Another hales the sayleyards downe. And whyle they did eche thing \n Disorderly, the storme increast, and from eche quarter fling \n The wyndes with deadly foode, and bownce the raging waves togither. \n The Pilot being sore dismayd sayth playne, he knowes not whither \n To wend himself, nor what to doo or bid, nor in what state \n Things stood. So huge the mischeef was, and did so overmate \n All arte. For why of ratling ropes, of crying men and boyes, \n Of flusshing waves and thundring ayre, confused was the noyse. \n The surges mounting up aloft did seeme to mate the skye, \n And with theyr sprinckling for to wet the clowdes that hang on hye. \n One whyle the sea, when iirom the brink it raysd the yellow sand, \n Was like in colour to the same. Another whyle did stand \n A colour on it blacker than the Lake of Styx . Anon \n It lyeth playne and loomethwhyght with seething froth thereon.\n\n \n",
            "8":"\n\n And with the sea the Trachin shippe ay alteration tooke. \n One whyle as from a mountaynes toppe it seemed downe to looke \n To vallyes and the depth of hell. Another whyle beset \n With swelling surges round about which neere above it met, \n It looked from the bottom of the whoorlepoole up aloft \n As if it were from hell to heaven. A hideous flusshing oft \n The waves did make in beating full against the Gallyes syde. \n The Gallye being striken gave as great a sownd that tyde \n As did sumtyme the Battellramb of steele, or now the Gonne \n In making battrye to a towre. And as feerce Lyons ronne \n Full brist with all theyr force ageinst the armed men that stand \n In order bent to keepe them off with weapons in theyr hand, \n Even so as often as the waves by force of wynd did rave, \n So oft uppon the netting of the shippe they maynely drave, \n And mounted farre above the same. Anon off fell the hoopes: \n And having washt the pitch away, the sea made open loopes \n To let the deadly water in. Behold the clowdes did melt, \n And showers large came pooring downe. The seamen that them felt \n Myght thinke that all the heaven had falne uppon them that same tyme, \n And that the swelling sea likewyse above the heaven would clyme. \n The sayles were throughly wet with showers, and with the heavenly raine \n Was mixt the waters of the sea. No lyghts at all remayne \n Of sunne, or moone, or starres in heaven. The darknesse of the nyght \n Augmented with the dreadfull storme, takes dowble powre and myght. \n Howbee't the flasshing lyghtnings oft doo put the same to flyght, \n And with theyr glauncing now and then do give a soodeine lyght. \n The lightnings setts the waves on fyre. Above the netting skippe \n The waves, and with a violent force doo lyght within the shippe. \n And as a souldyer stowter than the rest of all his band \n That oft assayles a citie walles defended well by hand, \n At length atteines his hope, and for to purchace prayse withall \n Alone among a thousand men getts up uppon the wall: \n So when the loftye waves had long the Gallyes sydes assayd, \n At length the tenth wave rysing up with huger force and brayd, \n Did never cease assaulting of the weery shippe, till that \n Uppon the hatches lyke a fo victoriously it gat. \n A part thereof did still as yit assault the shippe without, \n And part had gotten in. The men all trembling ran about, \n As in a Citie commes to passe, when of the enmyes sum \n Dig downe the walles without, and sum already in are come. \n All arte and conning was to seeke. Theyr harts and stomacks fayle: \n And looke, how many surges came theyr vessell to assayle, \n So many deathes did seeme to charge and breake uppon them all. \n One weepes: another stands amazde: the third them blist dooth call \n Whom buryall dooth remayne. To God another makes his vow, \n And holding up his handes to heaven the which hee sees not now, \n Dooth pray in vayne for help. The thought of this man is uppon \n His brother and his parents whom he cleerely hath forgone. \n Another calles his house and wyfe and children unto mynd, \n And every man in generall the things he left behynd. \n Alcyone moveth Ceyx hart. In Ceyx mouth is none \n But onely one Alcyone. And though shee were alone \n The wyght that he desyred most, yit was he verry glad \n Shee was not there. To Trachin ward to looke desyre he had, \n And homeward fayne he would have turnd his eyes which never more \n Should see the land. But then he knew not which way was the shore, \n Nor where he was. The raging sea did rowle about so fast: \n And all the heaven with clowds as black as pitch was over cast, \n That never nyght was halfe so dark. There came a flaw at last, \n That with his violence brake the maste, and strake the sterne away. \n A billowe proudly pranking up as vaunting of his pray \n By conquest gotten, walloweth hole and breaketh not asunder, \n Beholding with a lofty looke the waters woorking under. \n And looke, as if a man should from the places where they growe \n Rend downe the mountaynes, Athe and Pind, and whole them overthrowe \n Into the open sea: so soft the Billowe tumbling downe, \n With weyght and violent stroke did sink and in the bottom drowne \n The Gallye. And the moste of them that were within the same \n Went downe therwith and never up to open aier came, \n But dyed strangled in the gulf. Another sort againe \n Caught peeces of the broken shippe. The king himself was fayne \n A shiver of the sunken shippe in that same hand to hold, \n In which hee erst a royall mace had hilld of yellow gold. \n His father and his fathrinlawe he calles uppon (alas \n In vayne.) But cheefly in his mouth his wife Alcyone was. \n In hart was shee: in toong was shee: he wisshed that his corse \n To land where shee myght take it up the surges myght enforce: \n And that by her most loving handes he might be layd in grave. \n In swimming still (as often as the surges leave him gave \n To ope his lippes) he harped still upon Alcyones name, \n And when he drowned in the waves he muttred still the same. \n Behold, even full uppon the wave a flake of water blacke \n Did breake, and underneathe the sea the head of Ceyx stracke. \n That nyght the lyghtsum Lucifer for sorrowe was so dim, \n As scarcely could a man discerne or thinke it to bee him. \n And forasmuch as out of heaven he might not steppe asyde, \n With thick and darksum clowds that nyght his countnance he did hyde. \n Alcyone of so great mischaunce not knowing aught as yit, \n Did keepe a reckening of the nyghts that in the whyle did flit, \n And hasted garments both for him and for herself likewyse, \n To weare at his homecomming which shee vaynely did surmyse. \n To all the Goddes devoutly shee did offer frankincence: \n But most above them all the Church of Juno shee did sence. \n And for her husband (who as then was none) shee kneeld before \n The Altar, wisshing health and soone arrivall at the shore, \n And that none other woman myght before her be preferd. \n Of all her prayers this one peece effectually was heard. \n For Juno could not fynd in hart intreated for to bee \n For him that was already dead. But to th'entent that shee \n From dame Alcyones deadly hands might keepe her Altars free, \n Shee sayd: Most faythfull messenger of my commaundments, O \n Thou Raynebowe, to the slugguish house of Slomber swiftly go. \n And bid him send a Dreame in shape of Ceyx to his wyfe \n Alcyone, for to shew her playne the losing of his lyfe. \n Dame Iris takes her pall wherein a thousand colours were \n And bowwing lyke a stringed bow upon the dowdy sphere, \n Immediatly descended to the drowzye house of Sleepe \n Whose Court the clowdes continually doo clocely overdreepe.\n\n \n",

Theis three, \n Great kings and Capteines in the night are woonted for to see. \n The meaner and inferiour sort of others haunted bee. \n Sir Slomber overpast the rest, and of the brothers all \n To doo dame Iris message he did only Morphye call. \n Which doone he waxing luskish, streyght layd downe his drowzy head \n And softly shroonk his layzye limbes within his sluggish bed. \n Away flew Morphye through the aire: no flickring made his wings: \n And came anon to Trachine. There his fethers off he flings, \n And in the shape of Ceyx standes before Alcyones bed, \n Pale, wan, stark naakt, and like a man that was but lately deade. \n His berde seemd wet, and of his head the heare was dropping drye, \n And leaning on her bed, with teares he seemed thus to cry: \n Most wretched woman, knowest thou thy loving Ceyx now \n Or is my face by death disformd? behold mee well, and thow \n Shalt know mee. For thy husband, thou thy husbandes Ghost shalt see. \n No good thy prayers and thy vowes have done at all to mee. \n For I am dead. In vayne of my returne no reckning make. \n The dowdy sowth amid the sea our shippe did tardy take, \n And tossing it with violent blastes asunder did it shake. \n And floodes have filld my mouth which calld in vayne uppon thy name. \n No persone whom thou mayst misdeeme brings tydings of the same. \n Thou hearest not thereof by false report of flying fame. \n But I myself: I presently my shipwrecke to thee showe. \n Aryse therefore and wofull teares uppon thy spouse bestowe. \n Put moorning rayment on, and let mee not to Limbo go \n Unmoorned for. In shewing of this shipwrecke Morphye so \n Did feyne the voyce of Ceyx, that shee could none other deeme, \n But that it should bee his in deede. Moreover he did seeme \n To weepe in earnest: and his handes the verry gesture had \n Of Ceyx. Queene Alcyone did grone, and beeing sad \n Did stirre her armes, and thrust them foorth his body to embrace. \n In stead whereof shee caught but ayre. The teares ran downe her face. \n Shee cryed, Tarry: whither flyste? togither let us go. \n And all this whyle she was asleepe. Both with her crying so, \n And flayghted with the image of her husbands gastly spryght, \n She started up: and sought about if fynd him there shee myght. \n (For why her Groomes awaking with the shreeke had brought a light.) \n And when shee no where could him fynd, shee gan her face to smyght, \n And tare her nyghtclothes from her brest, and strake it feercely, and \n Not passing to unty her heare shee rent it with her hand. \n And when her nurce of this her greef desyrde to understand \n The cause: Alcyone is undoone, undoone and cast away \n With Ceyx her deare spouse (shee sayd). Leave comforting I pray. \n By shipwrecke he is perrisht: I have seene him: and I knew \n His handes. When in departing I to hold him did pursew \n I caught a Ghost: but such a Ghost as well discerne I myght \n To bee my husbands. Nathelesse he had not to my syght \n His woonted countenance, neyther did his visage shyne so bryght, \n As heeretofore it had beene woont. I saw him, wretched wyght, \n Starke naked, pale, and with his heare still wet: even verry heere \n I saw him stand. With that shee lookes if any print appeere \n Of footing where as he did stand uppon the floore behynd. \n This this is it that I did feare in farre forecasting mynd, \n When flying mee I thee desyrde thou shouldst not trust the wynd. \n But syth thou wentest to thy death, I would that I had gone \n With thee. Ah meete, it meete had beene thou shouldst not go alone \n Without mee. So it should have come to passe that neyther I \n Had overlived thee, nor yit beene forced twice to dye. \n Already, absent in the waves now tossed have I bee. \n Already have I perrished. And yit the sea hath thee \n Without mee. But the cruelnesse were greater farre of mee \n Than of the sea, if after thy decease I still would strive \n In sorrow and in anguish still to pyne away alive. \n But neyther will I strive in care to lengthen still my lyfe, \n Nor (wretched wyght) abandon thee: but like a faythfull wyfe \n At leastwyse now will come as thy companion. And the herse \n Shall joyne us, though not in the selfsame coffin: yit in verse. \n Although in tumb the bones of us togither may not couch, \n Yit in a graven Epitaph my name thy name shall touch. \n Her sorrow would not suffer her to utter any more. \n Shee sobd and syghde at every woord, untill her hart was sore. \n The morning came, and out shee went ryght pensif to the shore \n To that same place in which shee tooke her leave of him before. \n Whyle there shee musing stood, and sayd: He kissed mee even heere, \n Heere weyed hee his Anchors up, heere loosd he from the peere. \n And whyle shee calld to mynd the things there marked with her eyes: \n In looking on the open sea, a great way off shee spyes \n A certaine thing much like a corse come hovering on the wave. \n At first shee dowted what it was. As tyde it neerer drave, \n Although it were a good way off, yit did it plainely showe \n To bee a corce. And though that whose it was shee did not knowe, \n Yit forbycause it seemd a wrecke, her hart therat did ryse: \n And as it had sum straunger beene, with water in her eyes \n She sayd: Alas poore wretch who ere thou art, alas for her \n That is thy wyfe, if any bee. And as the waves did stirre, \n The body floted neerer land: the which the more that shee \n Behilld, the lesse began in her of stayed wit to bee. \n Anon it did arrive on shore. Then plainely shee did see \n And know it, that it was her feere. Shee shreeked, It is hee. \n And therewithall her face, her heare, and garments shee did teare, \n And unto Ceyx stretching out her trembling handes with feare, \n Sayd: cumst thou home in such a plyght to mee, O husband deere? \n Returnst in such a wretched plyght? There was a certeine peere \n That buylded was by hand, of waves the first assaults to breake, \n And at the havons mouth to cause the tyde to enter weake. \n Shee lept thereon. (A wonder sure it was shee could doo so) \n Shee flew, and with her newgrowen winges did beate the ayre as tho. \n And on the waves a wretched bird shee whisked to and fro. \n And with her crocking neb then growen to slender bill and round, \n Like one that wayld and moorned still shee made a moaning sound. \n Howbee't as soone as she did touch his dumb and bloodlesse flesh, \n And had embraast his loved limbes with winges made new and fresh, \n And with her hardened neb had kist him coldly, though in vayne, \n Folk dowt if Ceyx feeling it to rayse his head did strayne, \n Or whither that the waves did lift it up. But surely hee \n It felt: and through compassion of the Goddes both hee and shee \n Were turnd to birdes. The love of them eeke subject to their fate, \n Continued after: neyther did the faythfull bond abate \n Of wedlocke in them beeing birdes: but standes in stedfast state. \n They treade, and lay, and bring foorth yoong and now the Alcyon sitts \n In wintertime uppon her nest, which on the water flitts \n A sevennyght. During all which tyme the sea is calme and still, \n And every man may to and fro sayle saufly at his will, \n For Aeolus for his offsprings sake the windes at home dooth keepe, \n And will not let them go abroade for troubling of the deepe.\n\n \n",

Paris was not at this obsequye. \n Within a whyle with ravisht wyfe he brought a lasting warre \n Home unto Troy . There followed him a thowsand shippes not farre \n Conspyrd togither, with the ayde that all the Greekes could fynd: \n And vengeance had beene tane foorthwith but that the cruell wynd \n Did make the seas unsaylable, so that theyr shippes were fayne \n At rode at fisshye Awlys in B'aeotia to remayne. \n Heere as the Greekes according to theyr woont made sacrifyse \n To Jove, and on the Altar old the flame aloft did ryse, \n They spyde a speckled Snake creepe up uppon a planetree bye \n Uppon the toppe whereof there was among the braunches hye \n A nest, and in the nest eyght birdes, all which and eeke theyr dam \n That flickering flew about her losse, the hungry snake did cram \n Within his mawe.

That battell did the Greeks full deerly cost. \n And Hector with his Phrygian folk of blood no little lost, \n In trying what the Greekes could doo. The shore was red with blood. \n And now king Cygnet , Neptunes sonne, had killed where he stood \n A thousand Greekes. And now the stout Achilles causd to stay \n His Charyot: and his lawnce did slea whole bandes of men that day. \n And seeking Cygnet through the feeld or Hector , he did stray. \n At last with Cygnet he did meete. For Hector had delay \n Untill the tenth yeare afterward. Then hasting foorth his horses \n With flaxen manes, ageinst his fo his Chariot he enforces. \n And brandishing his shaking dart, he sayd: O noble wyght, \n A comfort let it bee to thee that such a valeant knyght \n As is Achilles killeth thee. In saying so he threw \n A myghty dart, which though it hit the mark at which it flew, \n Yit perst it not the skinne at all. Now when this blunted blowe \n Had hit on Cygnets brest, and did no print of hitting showe, \n Thou, Goddesse sonne (quoth Cygnet ), for by fame we doo thee knowe. \n Why woondrest at mee for to see I can not wounded bee? \n (Achilles woondred much thereat.) This helmet which yee see \n Bedect with horses yellow manes, this sheeld that I doo beare, \n Defend mee not. For ornaments alonly I them weare. \n For this same cause armes Mars himself likewyse. I will disarme \n Myself, and yit unrazed will I passe without all harme. \n It is to sum effect, not borne to bee of Neryes race, \n So that a man be borne of him that with threeforked mace : \n Rules Nereus and his daughters too, and all the sea besyde. \n This sayd, he at Achilles sent a dart that should abyde \n Uppon his sheeld. It perced through the steele and through nyne fold \n Of Oxen hydes, and stayd uppon the tenth. Achilles bold \n Did wrest it out, and forcybly did throwe the same agayne. \n His bodye beeing hit ageine, unwounded did remayne, \n And cleere from any print of wound. The third went eeke in vayne. \n And yit did Cygnet to the same give full his naked brist. \n Achilles chafed like a Bull that in the open list \n With dreadfull homes dooth push ageinst the scarlet clothes that there \n Are hanged up to make him feerce, and when he would them teare \n Dooth fynd his wounds deluded. Then Achilles lookt uppon \n His Javelings socket, if the head thereof were looce or gone. \n The head stacke fast. My hand byleeke is weakened then (quoth lice), \n And all the force it had before is spent on one I see. \n For sure I am it was of strength, both when I first downe threw \n Lyrnessus walles, and when I did Ile Tenedos subdew, \n And eeke Aetions Thebe with her proper blood embrew. \n And when so many of the folke of Tewthranie I slew, \n That with theyr blood Caycus streame became of purple hew. \n And when the noble Telephus did of my Dart of steele \n The dowble force, of wounding and of healing also feele. \n Yea even the heapes of men slayne heere by mee, that on this strond \n Are lying still to looke uppon, doo give to understond \n That this same hand of myne both had and still hath strength. This sed, \n (As though he had distrusted all his dooings ere that sted,) \n He threw a Dart ageinst a man of Lycia land that hyght \n Menetes, through whose Curets and his brest he strake him quyght. \n And when he saw with dying limbes him sprawling on the ground, \n He stepped to him streyght, and pulld the Javeling from the wound, \n And sayd alowd: This is the hand, this is the selfsame dart \n With which my hand did strike even now Menetes to the hart. \n Ageinst my tother Copemate will I use the same: I pray \n To God it may have like successe. This sed, without delay \n He sent it toward Cygnet , and the weapon did not stray, \n Nor was not shunned. Insomuch it lighted full uppon \n His shoulder: and it gave a rappe as if uppon sum ston \n It lyghted had, rebownding backe. Howbeeit where it hit, \n Achilles sawe it bloodye, and was vaynly glad of it. \n For why there was no wound. It was Menetes blood. Then lept \n He hastly from his Charyot downe, and like a madman stept \n To carelesse Cygnet with his swoord. He sawe his swoord did pare \n His Target and his morion bothe. But when it toucht the bare, \n His bodye was so hard, it did the edge thereof abate. \n He could no lengar suffer him to tryumph in that rate, \n But with the pommell of his swoord did thump him on the pate, \n And bobd him well about the brewes a doozen tymes and more, \n And preacing on him as he still gave backe amaazd him sore, \n And troubled him with buffetting, not respetting a whit. \n Then Cygnet gan to bee afrayd, and mistes beegan to flit \n Before his eyes, and dimd his syght. And as he still did yeeld, \n In giving back, by chaunce he met a stone amid the feeld, \n Ageinst the which Achilles thrust him back with all his myght, \n And throwing him ageinst the ground, did cast him bolt upryght. \n Then bearing bostowsely with both his knees ageinst his chest, \n And leaning with his elbowes and his target on his brest, \n He shet his headpeece cloce and just, and underneathe his chin \n So hard it straynd, that way for breath was neyther out nor in, \n And closed up the vent of lyfe. And having gotten so \n The upper hand, he went about to spoyle his vanquisht fo. \n But nought he in his armour found. For Neptune had as tho \n Transformd him to the fowle whose name he bare but late ago.\n\n \n",

And every wyght \n Delyghts to uppen oftentymes by turne as came about \n The perills and the narrow brunts himself had shifted out. \n For what thing should bee talkt beefore Achilles rather? Or \n What kynd of things than such as theis could seeme more meeter for \n Achilles to bee talking of? But in theyr talk most breeme \n Was then Achilles victory of Cygnet. It did seeme \n A woonder that the flesh of him should bee so hard and tough \n As that no weapon myght have powre to raze or perce it through, \n But that it did abate the edge of steele: it was a thing \n That both Achilles and the Greekes in woondrous maze did bring. \n Then Nestor sayd: This Cygnet is the person now alone \n Of your tyme that defyed steele, and could bee perst of none. \n But I have seene now long ago one Cene of Perrhebye, \n I sawe one Cene of Perrhebye a thousand woundes defye \n With unatteynted bodye. In mount Othris he did dwell: \n And was renowmed for his deedes: (and which in him ryght well \n A greater woonder did appeere) he was a woman borne. \n This uncouth made them all much more amazed than beforne, \n And every man desyred him to tell it. And among \n The rest, Achilles sayd: Declare, I pray thee (for wee long \n To heare it every one of us), O eloquent old man, \n The wisedome of our age: what was that Cene and how he wan \n Another than his native shape, and in what rode, or in \n What fyght or skirmish, tweene you first acquaintance did beegin, \n And who in fyne did vanquish him if any vanquisht him. \n Then Nestor: Though the length of tyme have made my senses dim, \n And dyvers things erst seene in youth now out of mynd be gone: \n Yit beare I still mo things in mynd: and df them all is none \n Among so many both of peace and warre, that yit dooth take \n More stedfast roote in memorye. And if that tyme may make \n A man great store of things through long continuance for to see, \n Two hundred yeeres already of my lyfe full passed bee, \n And now I go uppon the third. This foresayd Ceny was \n The daughter of one Elatey. In beawty shee did passe \n The maydens all of Thessaly . From all the Cities bye \n And from thy Cities also, O Achilles, came (for why \n Shee was thy countrywoman) store of wooers who in vayne \n In hope to win her love did take great travail, suit and payne. \n Thy father also had perchaunce attempted heere to matcht \n But that thy moothers maryage was alreadye then dispatcht, \n Or shee at least affyanced. But Ceny matcht with none, \n Howbeeit as shee on the shore was walking all alone, \n The God of sea did ravish her. (So fame dooth make report.) \n And Neptune for the great delight he had in Venus sport, \n Sayd: Ceny, aske mee what thou wilt, and I will give it thee. \n (This also bruited is by fame.) The wrong heere doone to mee \n (Quoth Ceny) makes mee wish great things. And therfore to th'entent \n I may no more constreyned bee to such a thing, consent \n I may no more a woman bee. And if thou graunt thereto, \n It is even all that I desyre, or wish thee for to doo. \n In bacer tune theis latter woordes were uttred, and her voyce \n Did seeme a mannes voyce as it was in deede. For to her choyce \n The God of sea had given consent. He graunted him besyde \n That free from wounding and from hurt he should from thence abyde, \n And that he should not dye of steele. Right glad of this same graunt \n Away went Ceny, and the feeldes of Thessaly did haunt, \n And in the feates of Chevalrye from that tyme spent his lyfe. \n\n \n",

He spewd as well at mouth as wound \n Mixt cloddes of blood, and brayne and wyne, and on the soyled ground \n Lay sprawling bolt upryght. The death of him did set the rest, \n His dowblelimbed brothers, so on fyre, that all the quest \n With one voyce cryed out, Kill, kill. The wyne had given them hart. \n Theyr first encounter was with cuppes and cannes throwen overthwart, \n And brittle tankerds, and with boawles, pannes, dishes, potts, and trayes, \n Things serving late for meate and drinke, and then for bluddy frayes. \n First Amycus, Ophions sonne, without remorse began \n To reeve and rob the brydehouse of his furniture. He ran \n And pulled downe a Lampbeame full of lyghtes, and lifting it \n Aloft like one that with an Ax dooth fetch his blowe to slit \n An Oxis necke in sacrifyse, he on the forehead hit \n A Lapith named Celadon, and crusshed so his bones \n That none could know him by the face: both eyes flew out at ones. \n His nose was beaten backe and to hispallat battred flat. \n One Pelates, a Macedone, exceeding wroth therat, \n Pulld out a maple tressles foote, and napt him in the necks, \n That bobbing with his chin ageinst his brest to ground he becks. \n And as he spitted out his teeth with blackish blood, he lent \n Another blowe to Amycus, which streyght to hell him sent. \n Gryne standing by and lowring with a fell grim visage at \n The smoking Altars, sayd: Why use we not theis same? with that \n He caught a myghty altar up with burning fyre thereon, \n And it among the thickest of the Lapithes threw anon. \n And twoo he over whelmd therewith calld Brote and Orion. \n This Orions moother, Mycale, is knowne of certeintye \n The Moone resisting to have drawne by witchcraft from the skye. \n Full dearely shalt thou by it (quoth Exadius) may I get \n A weapon: and with that in stead of weapon, he did set \n His hand uppon a vowd harts horne that on a Pynetree hye \n Was nayld, and with two tynes therof he strake out eyther eye \n Of Gryne: whereof sum stacke uppon the home, and sum did flye \n Uppon his beard, and there with blood like jelly mixt did lye. \n A flaming fyrebrand from amids an Altar Rhaetus snatcht, \n With which uppon the leftsyde of his head Charaxus latcht \n A blow that crackt his skull. The blaze among his yellow heare \n Ran sindging up, as if dry come with lightning blasted were. \n And in his wound the seared blood did make a greevous sound, \n As when a peece of steele red hot tane up with tongs is drownd \n In water by the smith, it spirts and hisseth in the trowgh. \n Charaxus from his curled heare did shake the fyre, and thowgh \n He wounded were, yit caught he up uppon his shoulders twayne \n A stone, the Jawme of eyther doore that well would loade a wayne. \n The masse theof was such as that it would not let him hit \n His fo. It lighted short: and with the falling downe of it \n A mate of his that Comet hyght, it all in peeces smit. \n Then Rhaete restreyning not his joy, sayd thus: I would the rowt \n Of all thy mates myght in the selfsame maner prove them stowt. \n And with his halfeburnt brond the wound he searched new agayne, \n Not ceasing for to lay on loade uppon his pate amayne, \n Untill his head was crusht, and of his scalp the bones did swim \n Among his braynes. In jolly ruffe he passed streyght from him \n To Coryt, and Euagrus, and to Dryant on a rowe. \n Of whom when Coryt (on whose cheekes yoong mossy downe gan grow) \n Was slayne, What prayse or honour (quoth Euagrus) hast thou got \n By killing of a boy? mo woordes him Rhetus suffred not \n To speake, but in his open mouth did thrust his burning brand, \n And downe his throteboll to his chest. Then whisking in his hand \n His fyrebrand round about his head he feercely did assayle \n The valyant Dryant. But with him he could not so prevayle. \n For as he triumpht in his lucke, proceeding for to make \n Continuall slaughter of his foes, sir Dryant with a stake \n (Whose poynt was hardned in the fyre) did cast at him a foyne \n And thrust him through the place in which the neck and shoulders joyne. \n He groand and from his cannell bone could scarcely pull the stake. \n And beeing foyled with his blood to flyght he did him take. \n Arnaeus also ran away, and Lycidas likewyse. \n And Medon (whose ryght shoulderplate was also wounded) flyes. \n So did Pisenor, so did Cawne, and so did Mermeros \n Who late outronning every man, now wounded slower goes: \n And so did Phole, and Menelas, and Abas who was woont \n To make a spoyle among wylde Boares as oft as he did hunt: \n And eeke the wyzarde Astylos who counselled his mates \n To leave that fray: but he to them in vayne of leaving prates. \n He eeke to Nessus (who for feare of wounding seemed shye) \n Sayd: Fly not, thou shalt scape this fray of Hercles bowe to dye. \n But Lycid and Ewrinomos, and Imbreus, and Are \n Escapte not death. Sir Dryants hand did all alike them spare. \n Cayneius also (though that he in flying were not slacke,) \n Yit was he wounded on the face: for as he looked backe, \n A weapons poynt did hit him full midway betweene the eyes, \n Wheras the noze and forehead meete. For all this deane, yit lyes \n Aphipnas snorting fast asleepe not mynding for to wake, \n Wrapt in a cloke of Bearskinnes which in Ossa mount were take. \n\n \n",
            "4":"\n\n And in his lither hand he hilld a potte of wyne. Whom when \n That Phorbas saw (although in vayne) not medling with them, then \n He set his fingars to the thong: and saying: Thou shalt drink \n Thy wyne with water taken from the Stygian fountaynes brink, \n He threw his dart at him. The dart (as he that tyme by chaunce \n Lay bolt upright uppon his backe) did through his throteboll glaunce. \n He dyde and felt no payne at all. The blacke swart blood gusht out, \n And on the bed and in the potte fell flushing lyke a spout. \n I saw Petreius go about to pull out of the ground \n An Oken tree. But as he had his armes about it round, \n And shaakt it too and fro to make it looce, Pirithous cast \n A Dart which nayled to the tree his wrything stomacke fast. \n Through prowesse of Pirithous (men say) was Lycus slayne. \n Through prowesse of Pirithous dyde Crome. But they both twayne \n Lesse honour to theyr conquerour were, than Dyctis was, or than \n Was Helops. Helops with a dart was striken, which through ran \n His head, and entring at the ryght eare to the left eare went. \n And Dyctis from a slipprye knappe downe slyding, as he ment \n To shonne Perithous preacing on, fell headlong downe, and with \n His hugenesse brake the greatest Ash that was in all the frith, \n And goard his gutts uppon the stump. To wreake his death comes Phare: \n And from the mount a mighty rocke with bothe his handes he tare: \n Which as he was about to throwe, Duke Theseus did prevent, \n And with an Oken plant uppon his mighty elbowe lent \n Him such a blowe, as that he brake the bones, and past no further. \n For leysure would not serve him then his maymed corce to murther. \n He lept on hygh Bianors backe, who none was woont to beare \n Besydes himself. Ageinst his sydes his knees fast nipping were, \n And with his left hand taking hold uppon his foretoppe heare \n He cuft him with his knubbed plant about the frowning face, \n And made his wattled browes to breake. And with his Oken mace \n He overthrew Nedimnus: and Lycespes with his dart, \n And Hippasus whose beard did hyde his brest the greater part: \n And Riphey tallar than the trees, and Therey who was woont \n Among the hilles of Thessaly for cruell Beares to hunt, \n And beare them angry home alyve. It did Demoleon spyght \n That Theseus had so good successe and fortune in his fyght. \n An old long Pynetree rooted fast he strave with all his myght \n To pluck up whole bothe trunk and roote, which when he could not bring \n To passe, he brake it off, and at his emnye did it fling. \n But Theseus by admonishment of heavenly Pallas (so \n He would have folke beleve it were) start backe a great way fro \n The weapon as it came. Yit fell it not without some harme. \n It cut from Crantors left syde bulke, his shoulder, brest, and arme. \n This Grantor was thy fathers Squyre (Achilles) and was given \n Him by Amyntor ruler of the Dolops, who was driven \n By battell for to give him as an hostage for the peace \n To bee observed faythfully. When Peleus in the preace \n A great way off behilld him thus falne dead of this same wound, \n O Grantor, deerest man to mee of all above the ground, \n Hold heere an obitgift hee sayd: and both with force of hart \n And hand, at stout Demoleons head he threw an asshen dart, \n Which brake the watling of his ribbes, and sticking in the bone, \n Did shake. He pulled out the steale with much adoo alone. \n The head therof stacke still behynd among his lungs and lyghts. \n Enforst to courage with his payne, he ryseth streight uprights, \n And pawing at his emny with his horsish feete, he smyghts \n Uppon him. Peleus bare his strokes uppon his burganet, \n And fenst his shoulders with his sheeld, and evermore did set \n His weapon upward with the poynt, which by his shoulders perst \n Through both his brestes at one full blowe. Howbee't your father erst \n Had killed Hyle and Phlegrye, and Hiphinous aloof \n And Danes who boldly durst at hand his manhod put in proof. \n To theis was added Dorylas, who ware uppon his head \n A cap of woolves skinne. And the homes of Oxen dyed red \n With blood were then his weapon. I (for then my courage gave \n Mee strength) sayd: See how much thy homes lesse force than Iron have. \n And therewithall with manly might a dart at him I drave. \n Which when he could not shonne, he clapt his right hand flat uppon \n His forehead where the wound should bee. For why his hand anon \n Was nayled to his forehead fast. Hee roared out amayne. \n And as he stood amazed and began to faynt for payne, \n Your father Peleus (for he stood hard bv him) strake him under \n The middle belly with his swoord, and ript his womb asunder. \n Out girdes mee Dorill streyght, and trayles his guttes uppon the ground \n And trampling underneath his feete did breake them, and they wound \n About his leggs so snarling, that he could no further go, \n But fell downe dead with empty womb. Nought booted Cyllar tho \n His beawtye in that frentick fray, (at leastwyse if wee graunt \n That any myght in that straunge shape, of natures beawtye vaunt.) \n His beard began but then to bud: his beard was like the gold: \n So also were his yellowe lokes, which goodly to behold \n Midway beneath his shoulders hung. There rested in his face \n A sharpe and lively cheerfulnesse with sweete and pleasant grace. \n His necke, brest, shoulders, armes, and hands, as farre as he was man, \n Were such as never carvers woork yit stayne them could or can. \n His neather part likewyse (which was a horse) was every whit \n Full equall with his upper part, or little woorse than it. \n For had yee given him horses necke, and head, he was a beast \n For Castor to have ridden on. So bourly was his brest: \n So handsome was his backe to beare a saddle: and his heare \n Was blacke as jeate, but that his tayle and feete milk whyghtish were. \n Full many Females of his race did wish him to theyr make. \n But only dame Hylonome for lover he did take. \n Of all the halfbrutes in the woodes there did not any dwell \n More comly than Hylonome. She usde herself so well \n In dalyance, and in loving, and in uttring of her love, \n That shee alone hilld Cyllarus. As much as did behove \n In suchye limbes, shee trimmed them as most the eye might move. \n With combing, smoothe shee made her heare: shee wallowed her full oft \n In Roses and in Rosemarye, or Violets sweete and soft: \n Sumtyme shee caryed Lillyes whyght: and twyce a day shee washt \n Her visage in the spring that from the toppe of Pagase past: \n And in the streame shee twyce a day did bath her limbes: and on \n Her left syde or her shoulders came the comlyest things, and none \n But fynest skinnes of choycest beasts. Alike eche loved other: \n Togither they among the hilles roamd up and downe: togither \n They went to covert: and that tyme togither they did enter \n The Lapithes house, and there the fray togither did adventer. \n A dart on Cyllars left syde came, (I know not who it sent) \n Which sumwhat underneathe his necke his brest asunder splent. \n As lyghtly as his hart was raazd, no sooner was the dart \n Pluckt out, but all his bodye wext stark cold and dyed swart. \n Immediatly Hylonome his dying limbes up stayd, \n And put her hand uppon the wound to stoppe the blood, and layd \n Her mouth to his, and labored sore to stay his passing spryght. \n But when shee sawe him throughly dead, then speaking woordes which might \n Not to my hearing come for noyse, shee stikt herself uppon \n The weapon that had gored him, and dyde with him anon \n Embracing him beetweene her armes. \n\n \n",
            "5":"\n\n There also stood before \n Myne eyes the grim Pheocomes both man and horse who wore \n A Lyons skinne uppon his backe fast knit with knotts afore. \n He snatching up a timber log (which scarcely two good teeme \n Of Oxen could have stird) did throwe the same with force extreeme \n At Phonolenyes sonne. The logge him all in fitters strake, \n And of his head the braynepan in a thousand peeces brake, \n That at his mouth, his eares, and eyes, and at his nosethrills too, \n His crusshed brayne came roping out as creame is woont to doo \n From sives or riddles made of wood, or as a Cullace out \n From streyner or from Colender. But as he went about \n To strippe him from his harnesse as he lay uppon the ground, \n (Your father knoweth this full well) my sword his gutts did wound, \n Teleboas and Cthonius bothe, were also slaine by mee. \n Sir Cthonius for his weapon had a forked bough of tree. \n The tother had a dart. His dart did wound mee. You may see \n The scarre therof remayning yit. Then was the tyme that I \n Should sent have beene to conquer Troy . Then was the tyme that I \n Myght through my force and prowesse, if not vanquish Hector stout, \n Yit at the least have hilld him wag, I put you out of Dout. \n But then was Hector no body: or but a babe. And now \n Am I forspent and worne with yeeres. What should I tell you how \n Piretus dyde by Periphas? Or wherefore should I make \n Long processe for to tell you of sir Ampycus that strake \n The fowrefoote Oecle on the face with dart of Cornell tree, \n The which had neyther head nor poynt? Or how that Macaree \n Of Mountaine Pelithronye with a leaver lent a blowe \n To Erigdupus on the brest which did him overthrowe? \n Full well I doo remember that Cymelius threw a dart \n Which lyghted full in Nesseyes flank about his privie part. \n And think not you that Mops, the sonne of Ampycus, could doo \n No good but onely prophesye. This stout Odites whoo \n Had bothe the shapes of man and horse, by Mopsis dart was slayne, \n And labouring for to speake his last he did but strive in vayne. \n For Mopsis dart togither nayld his toong and neather chappe, \n And percing through his throte did make a wyde and deadly gappe. \n Fyve men had Cene already slayne: theyr wounds I cannot say: \n The names and nomber of them all ryght well I beare away. \n The names of them were Stiphelus, and Brome , and Helimus, \n Pyracmon with his forest bill, and stout Antimachus. \n Out steppes the biggest Centawre there, huge Latreus, armed in \n Alesus of Aemathias spoyle slayne late before by him. \n His yeeres were mid tweene youth and age, his courage still was yoong, \n And on his abrun head hore heares peerd heere and there amoong. \n His furniture was then a swoord, a target and a lawnce \n Aemathian like. To bothe the parts he did his face advaunce, \n And brandishing his weapon brave, in circlewyse did prawnce \n About, and stoutly spake theis woordes: And must I beare with yow, \n Dame Cenye? for none other than a moother (I avow) \n No better than a moother will I count thee whyle I live. \n Remembrest not what shape by birth dame nature did thee give? \n Forgettst thou how thou purchasedst this counterfetted shape \n Of man? Consyderest what thou art by birth? and how for rape \n Thou art become the thing thou art? Go take thy distaffe, and \n Thy spindle, and in spinning yarne go exercyse thy hand. \n Let men alone with feates of armes. As Latreus made this stout \n And scornefull taunting in a ring still turning him about, \n This Cenye with a dart did hit him full uppon the syde \n Where as the horse and man were joyned togither in a hyde. \n The strype made Latreus mad: and with his lawnce in rage he stracke \n Uppon sir Cenyes naked ribbes. The lawnce rebounded backe \n Like haylestones from a tyled house, or as a man should pat \n Small stones uppon a dromslets head. He came more neere with that, \n And in his brawned syde did stryve to thrust his swoord. There was \n No way for swoord to enter in. Yit shalt thou not so passe \n My handes (sayd he.) Well sith the poynt is blunted thou shalt dye \n Uppon the edge: and with that woord he fetcht his blow awrye, \n And sydling with a sweeping stroke along his belly smit. \n The strype did give a clinke as if it had on marble hit. \n And therewithall the swoord did breake, and on his necke did lyght. \n When Ceny had sufficiently given Latreus leave to smyght \n His flesh which was unmaymeable, Well now (quoth he) lets see, \n If my swoord able bee or no to byght the flesh of thee. \n In saying so, his dreadfull swoord as farre as it would go \n He underneathe his shoulder thrust, and wrinching to and fro \n Among his gutts, made wound in wound. Behold with hydeous crye \n The dowblemembred Centawres sore abasht uppon him flye, \n And throwe theyr weapons all at him. Theyr weapons downe did fall \n As if they had rebated beene, and Cenye for them all \n Abydes unstriken through. Yea none was able blood to drawe. \n The straungenesse of the cace made all amazed that it sawe. \n Fy, fy for shame (quoth Monychus) that such a rable can \n Not overcome one wyght alone, who scarcely is a man. \n Although (to say the very truthe) he is the man, and wee \n Through fayntnesse that that he was borne by nature for to bee. \n What profits theis huge limbes of ours? what helpes our dowble force? \n Or what avayles our dowble shape of man as well as horse \n By puissant nature joynd in one? I can not thinke that wee \n Of sovereigne Goddesse Juno were begot, or that wee bee \n Ixions sonnes, who was so stout of courage and so hault, \n As that he durst on Junos love attempt to give assault. \n The emny that dooth vanquish us is scarcely half a man \n Whelme blocks, and stones, and mountaynes whole uppon his hard brayne pan: \n And presse yee out his lively ghoste with trees. Let timber choke \n His chappes, let weyght enforce his death in stead of wounding stroke. \n This sayd: by chaunce he gets a tree blowne downe by blustring blasts \n Of Southerne wynds, and on his fo with all his myght it casts, \n And gave example to the rest to doo the like. Within \n A whyle the shadowes which did hyde mount Pelion waxed thin: \n And not a tree was left uppon mount Othris ere they went. \n Sir Cenye underneathe this greate huge pyle of timber pent, \n Did chauf and on his shoulders hard the heavy logges did beare. \n But when above his face and head the trees up stacked were, \n So that he had no venting place to drawe his breth: One whyle \n He faynted: and another whyle he heaved at the pyle, \n To tumble downe the loggs that lay so heavy on his backe, \n And for to winne the open ayre ageine above the stacke: \n As if the mountayne Ida (lo) which yoonder we doo see \n So hygh, by earthquake at a tyme should chaunce to shaken bee. \n Men dowt what did become of him. Sum hold opinion that \n The burthen of the woodes had driven his soule to Limbo flat. \n But Mopsus sayd it was not so. For he did see a browne \n Bird flying from amid the stacke and towring up and downe. \n It was the first tyme and the last that ever I behild \n That fowle. When Mopsus softly saw him soring in the feeld, \n He looked wistly after him, and cryed out on hye: \n Hayle peerlesse perle of Lapith race, hayle Ceny, late ago \n A valeant knyght, and now a bird of whom there is no mo. \n The author caused men beleeve the matter to bee so. \n Our sorrow set us in a rage. It was too us a greef \n That by so many foes one knyght was killd without releef. \n Then ceast wee not to wreake our teene till most was slaine in fyght, \n And that the rest discomfited were fled away by nyght.\n\n \n",
            "6":"\n\n As Nestor all the processe of this battell did reherce \n Betweene the valeant Lapithes and misshapen Centawres ferce, \n Tlepolemus displeased sore that Hercules was past \n With silence, could not hold his peace, but out theis woordes did cast: \n My Lord, I muse you should forget my fathers prayse so quyght. \n For often unto mee himself was woonted to recite, \n How that the clowdbred folk by him were cheefly put to flyght. \n Ryght sadly Nestor answerd thus: Why should you mee constreyne \n To call to mynd forgotten greefs? and for to reere ageine \n The sorrowes now outworne by tyme? or force mee to declare \n The hatred and displeasure which I to your father bare? \n In sooth his dooings greater were than myght bee well beleeved. \n He fild the world with high renowme which nobly he atcheeved. \n Which thing I would I could denye. For neyther set wee out \n Deiphobus, Polydamas, nor Hector that most stout \n And valeant knyght, the strength of Troy . For whoo will prayse his fo? \n Your father overthrew the walles of Messen long ago, \n And razed Pyle , and Ely townes unwoorthye serving so. \n And feerce ageinst my fathers house hee usde bothe swoord and fyre. \n And (not to speake of others whom he killed in his ire) \n Twyce six wee were the sonnes of Nele all lusty gentlemen. \n Twyce six of us (excepting mee) by him were murthred then. \n The death of all the rest myght seeme a matter not so straunge: \n But straunge was Periclymens death whoo had the powre to chaunge \n And leave and take what shape he list (by Neptune to him given, \n The founder of the house of Nele). For when he had beene driven \n To try all shapes, and none could help: he last of all became \n The fowle that in his hooked feete dooth beare the flasshing flame \n Sent downe from heaven by Jupiter. He practising those birds, \n With flapping wings, and bowwing beake, and hooked talants girds \n At Hercle, and beescratcht his face. Too certeine (I may say) \n Thy father amde his shaft at him. For as he towring lay \n Among the clowdes, he hit him underneath the wing. The stroke \n Was small: howbee't bycause therwith the sinewes being broke, \n He wanted strength to maynteine flyght, he fell me to the ground, \n Through weakenesse of his wing. The shaft that sticked in the wound, \n By reason of the burthen of his bodye perst his syde, \n And at the leftsyde of his necke all bloodye foorth did glyde. \n Now tell mee, O thou beawtyfull Lord Amirall of the fleete \n Of Rhodes , if mee to speake the prayse of Hercle it bee meete. \n But lest that of my brothers deathes men think I doo desyre \n A further vendge than silence of the prowesse of thy syre, \n I love thee even with all my hart, and take thee for my freend. \n\n \n",
            "7":"\n\n When Nestor of his pleasant tales had made this freendly end, \n They called for a boll of wyne, and from the table went, \n And all the resdew of the nyght in sleeping soundly spent. \n But Neptune like a father tooke the matter sore to hart \n That Cygnet to a Swan he was constreyned to convert. \n And hating feerce Achilles, he did wreake his cruell teene \n Uppon him more uncourteously than had beseeming beene. \n For when the warres well neere full twyce fyve yeeres had lasted, hee \n Unshorne Apollo thus bespake: O nevew, unto mee \n Most deere of all my brothers impes, who helpedst mee to lay \n Foundation of the walles of Troy for which we had no pay, \n And canst thou syghes forbeare to see the Asian Empyre fall? \n And dooth it not lament thy hart when thou to mynd doost call \n So many thousand people slayne in keeping Ilion wall? \n Or (too th'entent particlerly I doo not speake of all) \n Remembrest thou not Hectors Ghost whoo harryed was about \n His towne of Troy ? where nerethelesse Achilles that same stout \n And farre in fyght more butcherly, whoo stryves with all his myght \n To stroy the woorke of mee and thee, lives still in healthfull plyght? \n If ever hee doo come within my daunger he shall feele \n What force is in my tryple mace. But sith with swoord of steele \n I may not meete him as my fo, I pray thee unbeeware \n Go kill him with a sodeine shaft and rid mee of my care. \n Apollo did consent: as well his uncle for to please, \n As also for a pryvate grudge himself had for to ease. \n And in a clowd he downe among the host of Troy did slyde, \n Where Paris dribbling out his shaftes among the Greekes hee spyde: \n And telling him what God he was, sayd: Wherfore doost thou waast \n Thyne arrowes on the simple sort? If any care thou haste \n Of those that are thy freendes, go turne ageinst Achilles head, \n And like a man revendge on him thy brothers that are dead. \n In saying this, he brought him where Achilles with his brond \n Was beating downe the Trojane folk, and leveld so his hond \n As that Achilles tumbled downe starke dead uppon the lond. \n This was the onely thing wherof the old king Priam myght \n Take comfort after Hectors death. That stout and valeant knyght \n Achilles whoo had overthrowen so many men in fyght, \n Was by that coward carpet knyght beereeved of his lyfe, \n Whoo like a caytif stale away the Spartane princes wyfe. \n But if of weapon womanish he had foreknowen it had \n His destnye beene to lose his lyfe, he would have beene more glad \n That Queene Penthesileas bill had slaine him out of hand. \n Now was the feare of Phrygian folk, the onely glory, and \n Defence of Greekes, that peerelesse prince in armes, Achilles turnd \n To asshes. That same God that had him armd, him also burnd. \n Now is he dust: and of that great Achilles bydeth still \n A thing of nought, that scarcely can a little coffin fill. \n Howbee't his woorthy fame dooth lyve, and spreadeth over all \n The world, a measure meete for such a persone to beefall. \n This matcheth thee, Achilles, full. And this can never dye. \n His target also (too th'entent that men myght playnly spye \n What wyghts it was) did move debate, and for his armour burst \n Out deadly foode. Not Diomed, nor Ajax Oylye durst \n Make clayme or chalendge to the same, nor Atreus yoonger sonne, \n Nor yit his elder, though in armes much honour they had wonne. \n Alone the sonnes of Telamon and Laert did assay \n Which of them two of that great pryse should beare the bell away. \n But Agamemnon from himself the hurthen putts, and cleeres \n His handes of envye, causing all the Capteines and the Peeres \n Of Greece to meete amid the camp togither in a place, \n To whom he put the heering and the judgement of the cace. \n"

            "0":"\n\n The Lordes and Capteynes being set toogither with the King, \n And all the souldiers standing round about them in a ring, \n The owner of the sevenfold sheeld, to theis did Ajax ryse. \n And (as he could not brydle wrath) he cast his frowning eyes \n Uppon the shore and on the fleete that there at Anchor lyes \n And throwing up his handes: God and must wee plead (quoth hee) \n Our case before our shippes? and must Ulysses stand with mee? \n But like a wretch he ran his way when Hector came with fyre, \n Which I defending from theis shippes did force him to retyre. \n It easyer is therefore with woordes in print to maynteine stryfe, \n Than for to fyght it out with fists. But neyther I am ryfe \n In woordes, nor hee in deedes. For looke how farre I him excell \n In battell and in feates of armes: so farre beares hee the bell \n From mee in talking. Neyther think I requisite to tell \n My actes among you. You your selves have seene them verry well. \n But let Ulysses tell you his doone all in hudther mudther, \n And wherunto the only nyght is privy and none other. \n The pryse is great (I doo confesse) for which wee stryve. But yit \n It is dishonour unto mee, for that in clayming it \n So bace a persone standeth in contention for the same. \n To think it myne already, ought to counted bee no shame \n Nor pryde in mee: although the thing of ryght great valew bee \n Of which Ulysses standes in hope. For now alreadye hee \n Hath wonne the honour of this pryse, in that when he shall sit \n Besydes the cuishon, he may brag he strave with mee for it. \n And though I wanted valiantnesse, yit should nobilitee \n Make with mee. I of Telamon am knowne the sonne to bee \n Who under valeant Hercules the walles of Troy did scale, \n And in the shippe of Pagasa to Colchos land did sayle. \n His father was that Aeacus whoo executeth ryght \n Among the ghostes where Sisyphus heaves up with all his myght \n The massye stone ay tumbling downe. The hyghest Jove of all \n Acknowledgeth this Aeacus, and dooth his sonne him call. \n Thus am I Ajax third from Jove. Yit let this Pedegree, \n O Achyves, in this case of myne avaylable not bee, \n Onlesse I proove it fully with Achylles to agree. \n He was my brother, and I clayme that was my brothers. Why \n Shouldst thou that art of Sisyphs blood, and for to filch and lye \n Expressest him in every poynt, by foorged pedegree \n Aly thee to the Aeacyds, as though we did not see \n Thee to the house of Aeacus a straunger for to bee? \n And is it reason that you should this armour mee denye \n Bycause I former was in armes, and needed not a spye \n To fetch mee foorth? Or think you him more woorthye it to have, \n That came to warrefare hindermost, and feynd himself to rave, \n Bycause he would have shund the warre? untill a suttler head \n And more unprofitable for himself, sir Palamed, \n Escryde the crafty fetches of his fearefull hart, and drew \n Him foorth a warfare which he sought so cowardly to eschew? \n Must he now needes enjoy the best and richest armour, whoo \n Would none at all have worne onlesse he forced were thertoo? \n And I with shame bee put besyde my cousin germanes gifts \n Bycause to shun the formest brunt of warres I sought no shifts? \n Would God this mischeef mayster had in verrye deede beene mad, \n Or else beleeved so to bee: and that wee never had \n Brought such a panion unto Troy . Then should not Paeans sonne \n In Lemnos like an outlawe to the shame of all us wonne. \n Who lurking now (as men report) in woodes and caves, dooth move \n The verry flints with syghes and grones, and prayers to God above \n To send Ulysses his desert. Which prayer (if there bee \n A God) must one day take effect. And now beehold how hee \n By othe a Souldier of our Camp, yea and as well as wee \n A Capteine too, alas, (who was by Hercules assignde \n To have the keeping of his shafts,) with payne and hungar pynde, \n Is clad and fed with fowles, and dribs his arrowes up and downe \n At birds, which were by destinye preparde to stroy Troy towne. \n Yit liveth hee bycause hee is not still in companie \n With sly Ulysses. Palamed that wretched knyght perdie, \n Would eeke he had abandond beene. For then should still the same \n Have beene alyve: or at the least have dyde without our shame. \n But this companion bearing (ah) too well in wicked mynd \n His madnesse which sir Palamed by wisdome out did fynd, \n Appeached him of treason that he practysde to betray \n The Greekish hoste. And for to vouch the fact, he shewd streyght way \n A masse of goold that he himself had hidden in his tent, \n And forged Letters which he feynd from Priam to bee sent. \n Thus eyther by his murthring men or else by banishment \n Abateth hee the Greekish strength. This is Ulysses fyght. \n This is the feare he puttes men in. But though he had more might \n Than Nestor hath, in eloquence he shal not compasse mee \n To think his leawd abandoning of Nestor for to bee \n No fault: who beeing cast behynd by wounding of his horse, \n And slowe with age, with calling on Ulysses waxing hoarce, \n Was nerethelesse betrayd by him. Sir Diomed knowes this cryme \n Is unsurmysde. For he himselfe did at that present tyme \n Rebuke him oftentymes by name, and feercely him upbrayd \n With flying from his fellowe so who stood in neede of ayd. \n With ryghtfull eyes dooth God behold the deedes of mortall men. \n Lo, he that helped not his freend wants help himself agen. \n And as he did forsake his freend in tyme of neede: so hee \n Did in the selfsame perrill fall forsaken for to bee. \n He made a rod to beat himself. He calld and cryed out \n Uppon his fellowes. Streight I came: and there I saw the lout \n Bothe quake and shake for feare of death, and looke as pale as clout. \n I set my sheeld betweene him and his foes, and him bestrid: \n And savde the dastards lyfe. Small prayse redoundes of that I did. \n But if thou wilt contend with mee, lets to the selfesame place \n Agein: bee wounded as thou wart: and in the foresayd case \n Of feare, beset about with foes: cowch underneath my sheeld: \n And then contend thou with mee there amid the open feeld. \n Howbee't, I had no sooner rid this champion of his foes, \n But where for woundes he scarce before could totter on his toes, \n He ran away apace, as though he nought at all did ayle. \n Anon commes Hector to the feeld and bringeth at his tayle \n The Goddes. Not only thy hart there (Ulysses) did thee fayle, \n But even the stowtest courages and stomacks gan to quayle. \n So great a terrour brought he in. Yit in the midds of all \n His bloody ruffe, I coapt with him, and with a foyling fall \n Did overthrowe him to the ground. Another tyme, when hee \n Did make a chalendge, you my Lordes by lot did choose out mee, \n And I did match him hand to hand. Your wisshes were not vayne. \n For if you aske mee what successe our combate did obteine, \n I came away unvanquished. Behold the men of Troy \n Brought fyre and swoord, and all the feendes our navye to destroy. \n And where was slye Ulysses then with all his talk so smooth? \n This brest of myne was fayne to fence your thousand shippes forsooth, \n The hope of your returning home. For saving that same day \n So many shippes, this armour give. But (if that I shall say \n The truth) the greater honour now this armour beares away. \n And our renownes togither link. For (as of reason ought) \n An Ajax for this armour, not an armour now is sought \n For Ajax. \n\n \n",
            "1":"\n\n Let Dulychius match with theis, the horses whyght \n Of Rhesus, dastard Dolon, and the coward carpetknyght \n King Priams Helen, and the stelth of Palladye by nyght. \n Of all theis things was nothing doone by day nor nothing wrought \n Without the helpe of Diomed. And therefore if yee thought \n To give them to so small deserts, devyde the same, and let \n Sir Diomed have the greater part. But what should Ithacus get \n And if he had them, who dooth all his matters in the dark, \n Who never weareth armour, who shootes ay at his owne mark \n To trappe his fo by stelth unwares? The very headpeece may \n With brightnesse of the glistring gold his privie feates bewray \n And shew him lurking. Neyther well of force Dulychius were \n The weyght of great Achilles helme uppon his pate to weare. \n It cannot but a burthen bee (and that ryght great) to beare \n (With those same shrimpish armes of his) Achilles myghty speare. \n Agen his target graven with the whole huge world theron \n Agrees not with a fearefull hand, and cheefly such a one \n As taketh filching even by kynd. Thou Lozell, thou doost seeke \n A gift that will but weaken thee, which if the folk of Greeke \n Shall give thee through theyr oversyght, it will be unto thee \n Occasion, of thyne emnyes spoyld not feared for to bee, \n And flyght (wherein thou, coward, thou all others mayst outbrag) \n Will hindred bee when after thee such masses thou shalt drag. \n Moreover this thy sheeld that feeles so seeld the force of fyght \n Is sound. But myne is gasht and hakt and stricken thurrough quyght \n A thousand tymes, with bearing blowes. And therfore myne must walk \n And put another in his stead. But what needes all this talk? \n Lets now bee seene another whyle what eche of us can doo. \n The thickest of our armed foes this armour throwe into, \n And bid us fetch the same fro thence. And which of us dooth fetch \n The same away, reward yee him therewith. Thus farre did stretch \n The woordes of Ajax. At the ende whereof there did ensew \n A muttring of the souldiers, till Laertis sonne the prew \n Stood up, and raysed soberly his eyliddes from the ground \n (On which he had a little whyle them pitched in a stound) \n And looking on the noblemen who longd his woordes to heere \n He thus began with comly grace and sober pleasant cheere: \n My Lordes, if my desyre and yours myght erst have taken place, \n It should not at this present tyme have beene a dowtfull cace, \n What person hath most ryght to this great pryse for which wee stryve. \n Achilles should his armour have, and wee still him alyve. \n Whom sith that cruell destinie to both of us denyes, \n (With that same woord as though he wept, he wypte his watry eyes) \n What wyght of reason rather ought to bee Achilles heyre, \n Than he through whom to this your camp Achilles did repayre? \n Alonly let it not avayle sir Ajax heere, that hee \n Is such a dolt and grossehead, as he shewes himself to bee \n Ne let my wit (which ay hath done you good, O Greekes) hurt mee. \n But suffer this mine eloquence (such as it is) which now \n Dooth for his mayster speake, and oft ere this hath spoke for yow, \n Bee undisdeynd. Let none refuse his owne good gifts he brings. \n For as for stocke and auncetors, and other such like things \n Wherof our selves no fownders are, I scarcely dare them graunt \n To bee our owne. But forasmuch as Ajax makes his vaunt \n To bee the fowrth from Jove: even Jove the founder is also \n Of my house: and than fowre descents I am from him no mo. \n Laertes is my father, and Arcesius his, and hee \n Begotten was of Jupiter. And in this pedegree \n Is neyther any damned soule, nor outlaw as yee see. \n Moreover by my moothers syde I come of Mercuree, \n Another honor to my house. Thus both by fathers syde \n And moothers (as you may perceyve) I am to Goddes alyde. \n But neyther for bycause I am a better gentleman \n Then Ajax by the moothers syde, nor that my father can \n Avouch himself ungiltye of his brothers blood, doo I \n This armour clayme. Wey you the case by merits uprightly, \n Provyded no prerogatyve of birthryght Ajax beare, \n For that his father Telamon, and Peleus brothers were. \n Let only prowesse in this pryse the honour beare away. \n Or if the case on kinrid or on birthryght seeme to stay, \n His father Peleus is alive, and Pyrrhus eeke his sonne. \n What tytle then can Ajax make? This geere of ryght should woone \n To Phthya, or to Scyros Ile. And Tewcer is as well \n Achilles uncle as is hee. Yit dooth not Tewcer mell. \n And if he did, should hee obteyne? Well, sith the cace dooth rest \n On tryall which of us can prove his dooings to bee best, \n I needes must say my deedes are mo than well I can expresse: \n Yit will I shew them orderly as neere as I can gesse. \n Foreknowing that her sonne should dye, the Lady Thetis hid \n Achilles in a maydes attyre. By which fyne slyght shee did \n All men deceyve, and Ajax too. This armour in a packe \n With other womens tryflyng toyes I caryed on my backe, \n A bayte to treyne a manly hart. Appareld like a mayd \n Achilles tooke the speare and sheeld in hand, and with them playd. \n Then sayd I: O thou Goddesse sonne, why shouldst thou bee afrayd \n To raze great Troy , whoose overthrowe for thee is onely stayd? \n And laying hand uppon him I did send him (as you see) \n To valeant dooings meete for such a valeant man as hee. \n And therfore all the deedes of him are my deedes. I did wound \n King Teleph with his speare, and when he lay uppon the ground, \n I was intreated with the speare to heale him safe and sound. \n That Thebe lyeth overthrowne, is my deede. You must think \n I made the folk of Tenedos and Lesbos for to shrink. \n Both Chryse and Cillas, Phebus townes, and Scyros I did take. \n And my ryght hand Lyrnessus walles to ground did levell make. \n I gave you him that should confound (besydes a number mo) \n The valeant Hector. Hector, that our most renowmed fo, \n Is slayne by mee. This armour heere I sue agein to have \n This armour by the which I found Achilles. I it gave \n Achilles whyle he was alive: and now that he is gone \n I clayme it as myne owne agein. What tyme the greefe of one \n Had perst the harts of all the Greekes, and that our thousand sayle \n At Awlis by Ewboya stayd, bycause the wyndes did fayle, \n Continewing eyther none at all or cleene ageinst us long, \n And that our Agamemnon was by destnyes overstrong \n Commaunded for to sacrifyse his giltlesse daughter to \n Diana, which her father then refusing for to doo \n Was angry with the Godds themselves, and though he were a king \n Continued also fatherlyke: by reason, I did bring \n His gentle nature to relent for publike profits sake. \n I must confesse (whereat his grace shall no displeasure take) \n Before a parciall judge I undertooke a ryght hard cace. \n Howbeeit for his brothers sake, and for the royall mace \n Committed, and his peoples weale, at length he was content \n To purchace prayse wyth blood. Then was I to the moother sent, \n Who not perswaded was to bee, but compast with sum guyle. \n Had Ajax on this errand gone, our shippes had all this whyle \n Lyne still there yit for want of wynd. Moreover I was sent \n To Ilion as ambassadour. I boldly thither went, \n And entred and behilld the Court, wherin there was as then \n Great store of princes, Dukes, Lords, knyghts, and other valeant men. \n And yit I boldly nerethelesse my message did at large \n The which the whole estate of Greece had given mee erst in charge. \n I made complaint of Paris , and accusde him to his head. \n Demaunding restitution of Queene Helen that same sted \n And of the bootye with her tane. Both Priamus the king \n And eeke Antenor his alye the woordes of mee did sting. \n And Paris and his brothers, and the resdew of his trayne \n That under him had made the spoyle, could hard and scarce refrayne \n There wicked hands. You, Menelay, doo know I doo not feyne. \n And that day was the first in which wee joyntly gan susteyne \n A tast of perrills, store whereof did then behind remayne.\n\n \n",
            "2":"\n\n It would bee overlong to tell eche profitable thing \n That during this long lasting warre I well to passe did bring, \n By force as well as pollycie. For after that the furst \n Encounter once was overpast, our emnyes never durst \n Give battell in the open feeld, but hild themselves within \n Theyr walles and bulwarks till the tyme the tenth yeere did begin, \n Now what didst thou of all that whyle, that canst doo nought but streeke? \n Or to what purpose servedst thou? For if thou my deedes seeke, \n I practysd sundry pollycies to trappe our foes unware: \n I fortifyde our Camp with trench which heretofore lay bare: \n I hartned our companions with a quiet mynd to beare \n The longnesse of the weery warre: I taught us how wee were \n Bothe to bee fed and furnished: and to and fro I went \n To places where the Counsell thought most meete I should bee sent. \n Behold the king deceyved in his dreame by false pretence \n Of Joves commaundement, bade us rayse our seedge and get us hence. \n The author of his dooing so may well bee his defence. \n Now Ajax should have letted this, and calld them backe ageine \n To sacke the towne of Troy . He should have fought with myght and maine. \n Why did he not restreyne them when they ready were to go? \n Why tooke he not his swoord in hand? why gave he not as tho \n Sum counsell for the fleeting folk to follow at the brunt? \n In fayth it had a tryfle beene to him that ay is woont \n Such vaunting in his mouth to have. But he himself did fly \n As well as others. I did see, and was ashamed, I, \n To see thee when thou fledst, and didst prepare so cowardly \n To sayle away. And thereuppon I thus aloud did cry: \n What meene yee, sirs? what madnesse dooth you move to go to shippe \n And suffer Troy as good as tane, thus out of hand to slippe? \n What else this tenth yeere beare yee home than shame? with such like woord \n And other, (which the eloquence of sorrowe did avoord,) \n I brought them from theyr flying shippes. Then Agamemnon calld \n Toogither all the capteines who with feare were yit appalld. \n But Ajax durst not then once creake. Yit durst Thersites bee \n So bold as rayle uppon the kings, and he was payd by mee \n For playing so the sawcye Jacke. Then stood I on my toes \n And to my fearefull countrymen gave hart ageinst theyr foes. \n And shed new courage in theyr mynds through talk that fro mee goes. \n From that tyme foorth what ever thing hath valeantly atcheeved \n By this good fellow beene, is myne, whoo him from flyght repreeved. \n And now to touche thee: which of all the Greekes commendeth thee? \n Or seeketh thee? But Diomed communicates with mee \n His dooings, and alloweth mee, and thinkes him well apayd \n To have Ulysses ever as companion at the brayd. \n And sumwhat woorth you will it graunt (I trow) alone for mee \n Out of so many thousand Greekes by Diomed pikt to bee. \n No lot compelled mee to go, and yit I setting lyght \n As well the perrill of my foes as daunger of the nyght, \n Killd Dolon who about the selfsame feate that nyght did stray, \n That wee went out for. But I first compelld him to bewray \n All things concerning faythlesse Troy , and what it went about. \n When all was learnd, and nothing left behynd to harken out, \n I myght have then come home with prayse. I was not so content. \n Proceeding further to the Camp of Rhesus streyght I went, \n And killed bothe himself and all his men about his tent. \n And taking bothe his chariot and his horses which were whyght, \n Returned home in tryumph like a conquerour from fyght. \n Denye you mee the armour of the man whoose steedes the fo \n Requyred for his playing of the spye a nyght, and so \n May Ajax bee more kynd to mee than you are. What should I \n Declare unto you how my sword did waste ryght valeantly \n Sarpedons hoste of Lycia ? I by force did overthrowe \n Alastor, Crome, and Ceranos, and Haly on a rowe. \n Alcander, and Noemon too, and Prytanis besyde, \n And Thoon and Theridamas, and Charops also dyde \n By mee, and so did Ewnomos enforst by cruell fate. \n And many mo in syght of Troy I slew of bacer state. \n There also are (O countrymen) about mee woundings, which \n The place of them make beawtyfull. See heere (his hand did twich \n His shirt asyde) and credit not vayne woordes. Lo heere the brist \n That alwayes to bee one in your affayres hath never mist. \n And yit of all this whyle no droppe of blood hath Ajax spent \n Uppon his fellowes. Woundlesse is his body and unrent. \n But what skills that, as long as he is able for to vaunt \n He fought against bothe Troy and Jove to save our fleete? I graunt \n He did so. For I am not of such nature as of spyght \n Well dooings to deface: so that he chalendge not the ryght \n Of all men to himself alone, and that he yeeld to mee \n Sum share, whoo of the honour looke a partener for to bee. \n Patroclus also having on Achilles armour, sent \n The Trojans and theyr leader hence, to burne our navye bent. \n And yit thinks hee that none durst meete with Hector saving hee, \n Forgetting bothe the king, and eeke his brother, yea and mee. \n Where hee himself was but the nyneth, appoynted by the king, \n And by the fortune of his lot preferd to doo the thing. \n But now for all your valeantnesse, what Issue had I pray \n Your combate? Shall I tell? Forsoothe, that Hector went his way \n And had no harme. Now wo is mee how greeveth it my hart \n To think uppon that season when the bulwark of our part \n Achilles dyde. When neyther teares, nor greef, nor feare could make \n Mee for to stay, but that uppon theis shoulders I did take, \n I say uppon theis shoulders I Achilles body tooke, \n And this same armour claspt theron, which now to weare I looke. \n Sufficient strength I have to beare as great a weyght as this, \n And eeke a hart wherein regard of honour rooted is. \n Think you that Thetis for her sonne so instantly besought \n Sir Vulcane this same heavenly gift to give her, which is wrought \n With such exceeding cunning, to th'entent a souldier that \n Hath neyther wit nor knowledge should it weare? He knowes not what \n The things ingraven on the sheeld doo meene. Of Ocean se, \n Of land, of heaven, and of the starres no skill at all hath he. \n The Beare that never dyves in sea he dooth not understand, \n The Pleyads, nor the Hyads, nor the cities that doo stand \n Uppon the earth, nor yit the swoord that Orion holdes in hand. \n He seekes to have an armour of the which he hath no skill. \n And yit in fynding fault with mee bycause I had no will \n To follow this same paynfull warre and sought to shonne the same, \n And made it sumwhat longer tyme before I thither came, \n He sees not how hee speakes reproch to stout Achilles name. \n For if to have dissembled in this case, yee count a cryme, \n Wee both offenders bee. Or if protracting of the tyme \n Yee count blame woorthye, yit was I the tymelyer of us twayne. \n Achilles loving moother him, my wyfe did mee deteyne. \n The former tyme was given to them, the rest was given to yow. \n And therefore doo I little passe although I could not now \n Defend my fault, sith such a man of prowesse, birth and fame \n As was Achilles, was with mee offender in the same. \n But yit was he espyed by Ulysses wit, but nat \n Ulysses by sir Ajax wit. And lest yee woonder at \n The rayling of this foolish dolt at mee, hee dooth object \n Reproche to you. For if that I offended to detect \n Sir Palamed of forged fault, could you without your shame \n Arreyne him, and condemne him eeke to suffer for the same? \n But neyther could sir Palamed excuse him of the cryme \n So heynous and so manifest: and you your selves that tyme \n Not onely his indytement heard, but also did behold \n His deed avowched to his face by bringing in the gold. \n\n \n",
            "3":"\n\n And as for Philoctetes, that he is in Lemnos , I \n Deserve not to bee toucht therwith. Defend your cryme: for why \n You all consented therunto. Yit doo I not denye, \n But that I gave the counsell to convey him out of way \n From toyle of warre and travell that by rest he myght assay \n To ease the greatnesse of his peynes. He did thereto obey \n And by so dooing is alyve. Not only faythfull was \n This counsell that I gave the man, but also happye, as \n The good successe hath shewed since. Whom sith the destnyes doo \n Requyre in overthrowing Troy , appoynt not mee thertoo: \n But let sir Ajax rather go. For he with eloquence \n Or by some suttle pollycie, shall bring the man fro thence \n And pacyfie him raging through disease, and wrathfull ire. \n Nay, first the river Simois shall to his spring retyre, \n And mountaine Ida shall theron have stonding never a tree, \n Yea and the faythlesse towne of Troy by Greekes shall reskewd bee, \n Before that Ajax blockish wit shall aught at all avayle, \n When my attempts and practyses in your affayres doo fayle. \n For though thou, Philoctetes, with the king offended bee, \n And with thy fellowes everychone, and most of all with mee, \n Although thou cursse and ban mee to the hellish pit for ay, \n And wisshest in thy payne that I by chaunce myght crosse thy way, \n Of purpose for to draw my blood: yit will I give assay \n To fetch thee hither once ageine. And (if that fortune say \n Amen,) I will as well have thee and eeke thyne arrowes, as \n I have the Trojane prophet whoo by mee surprysed was, \n Or as I did the Oracles and Trojane fates disclose, \n Or as I from her chappell through the thickest of her foes \n The Phrygian Pallads image fetcht: and yit dooth Ajax still \n Compare himself with mee. Yee knowe it was the destinyes will \n That Troy should never taken bee by any force, untill \n This Image first were got. And where was then our valeant knight \n Sir Ajax? Where the stately woordes of such a hardy wyght? \n Why feareth hee? Why dares Ulysses ventring through the watch \n Commit his persone to the nyght his buysnesse to dispatch? \n And through the pykes not only for to passe the garded wall \n But also for to enter to the strongest towre of all \n And for to take the Idoll from her Chappell and her shryne \n And beare her thence amid his foes? For had this deede of myne \n Beene left undoone, in vayne his sheeld of Oxen hydes seven fold \n Should yit the Sonne of Telamon have in his left hand hold. \n That nyght subdewed I Troy towne. That nyght did I it win, \n And opened it for you likewyse with ease to enter in. \n Cease to upbrayd mee by theis lookes and mumbling woordes of thyne \n With Diomed: his prayse is in this fact as well as myne. \n And thou thy selfe when for our shippes thou diddest in reskew stand, \n Wart not alone: the multitude were helping thee at hand. \n I had but only one with mee. Whoo (if he had not thought \n A wyseman better than a strong, and that preferment ought \n Not alway followe force of hand) would now himself have sought \n This Armour. So would toother Ajax better stayed doo, \n And feerce Ewrypyle, and the sonne of hault Andremon too. \n No lesse myght eeke Idominey, and eeke Meriones, \n His countryman, and Menelay. For every one of these \n Are valeant men of hand, and not inferior unto thee \n In martiall feates. And yit they are contented rulde to bee \n By myne advyce. Thou hast a hand that serveth well in fyght. \n Thou hast a wit that stands in neede of my direction ryght. \n Thy force is witlesse. I have care of that that may ensew. \n Thou well canst fyght: the king dooth choose the tymes for fyghting dew \n By myne advyce. Thou only with thy body canst avayle. \n But I with bodye and with mynd to profite doo not fayle, \n And looke how much the mayster dooth excell the gally slave, \n Or looke how much preheminence the Capteine ought to have \n Above his souldyer: even so much excell I also thee. \n A wit farre passing strength of hand inclosed is in mee. \n In wit rests cheefly all my force. My Lordes, I pray bestowe \n This gift on him who ay hath beene your watchman as yee knowe. \n And for my tenne yeeres cark and care endured for your sake \n Full recompence for my deserts with this same honour make. \n Our labour draweth to an end, all lets are now by mee \n Dispatched. And by bringing Troy in cace to taken bee \n I have already taken it. Now by the hope that yee \n Conceyve, within a whyle of Troy the mine for to see, \n And by the Goddes of whom alate our emnyes I bereft, \n And as by wisedome to bee doone yit any thing is left, \n If any bold aventrous deede, or any perlous thing, \n That asketh hazard both of lyfe and limb to passe to bring, \n Or if yee think of Trojane fates there yit dooth ought remayne, \n Remember mee. Or if from mee this armour you restrayne, \n Bestowe it on this same. With that he shewed with his hand \n Minervas fatall image, which hard by in syght did stand. \n The Lords were moved with his woordes, and then appeared playne \n The force that is in eloquence. The lerned man did gayne \n The armour of the valeant. He that did so oft susteine \n Alone both fyre, and swoord, and Jove, and Hector could not byde \n One brunt of wrath. And whom no force could vanquish ere that tyde, \n Now only anguish overcommes. He drawes his swoord and sayes: \n Well: this is myne yit. Unto this no clayme Ulysses layes. \n This must I use ageinst myself: this blade that heretofore \n Hath bathed beene in Trojane blood, must now his mayster gore \n That none may Ajax overcome save Ajax. With that woord \n Into his brest (not wounded erst) he thrust his deathfull swoord. \n His hand to pull it out ageine unable was. The blood \n Did spout it out. Anon the ground bestayned where he stood, \n Did breede the pretye purple flowre uppon a clowre of greene, \n Which of the wound of Hyacinth had erst engendred beene. \n The selfsame letters eeke that for the chyld were written than, \n Were now againe amid the flowre new written for the man. \n The former tyme complaynt, the last a name did represent. \n\n \n",

And Priams wretched wife \n Lost (after all) her womans shape, and barked all her lyfe \n In forreine countrye. In the place that bringeth to a streight \n The long spred sea of Hellespont , did Ilion burne in height. \n The kindled fyre with blazing flame continewed unalayd, \n And Priam with his aged blood Joves Altar had berayd. \n And Phebus preestesse casting up her handes to heaven on hye, \n Was dragd and haled by the heare. The Grayes most spyghtfully \n (As eche of them had prisoners tane in meede of victorye) \n Did drawe the Trojane wyves away, who lingring whyle they mought \n Among the burning temples of theyr Goddes, did hang about \n Theyr sacred shrynes and images. Astyanax downe was cast \n From that same turret from the which his moother in tyme past \n Had shewed him his father stand oft fyghting to defend \n Himself and that same famous realme of Troy that did descend \n From many noble auncetors. And now the northerne wynd \n With prosperous blasts, to get them thence did put the Greekes in mynd. \n The shipmen went aboord, and hoyst up sayles, and made fro thence. \n Adeew deere Troy (the women cryde), wee haled are from hence. \n And therwithall they kist the ground, and left yit smoking still \n Theyr native houses. Last of all tooke shippe ageinst her will \n Queene Hecub: who (a piteous cace to see) was found amid \n The tumbes in which her sonnes were layd. And there as Hecub did \n Embrace theyr chists and kisse theyr bones, Ulysses voyd of care \n Did pull her thence. Yit raught shee up, and in her boosom bare \n Away a crum of Hectors dust, and left on Hectors grave \n Her hory heares and teares, which for poore offrings shee him gave. \n Ageinst the place where Ilion was, there is another land \n Manured by the Biston men. In this same Realme did stand \n King Polemnestors palace riche, to whom king Priam sent \n His little infant Polydore to foster, to th'entent \n He might bee out of daunger from the warres: wherin he ment \n Ryght wysely, had he not with him great riches sent, a bayt \n To stirre a wicked covetous mynd to treason and deceyt. \n For when the state of Troy decayd, the wicked king of Thrace \n Did cut his nurcechylds weazant, and (as though the sinfull cace \n Toogither with the body could have quyght beene put away) \n He threw him also in the sea. It happened by the way, \n That Agamemnon was compeld with all his fleete to stay \n Uppon the coast of Thrace , untill the sea were wexen calme, \n And till the hideous stormes did cease, and furious wynds were falne. \n Heere rysing gastly from the ground which farre about him brake, \n Achilles with a threatning looke did like resemblance make \n As when at Agamemnon he his wrongfull swoord did shake, \n And sayd: Unmyndfull part yee hence of mee, O Greekes, and must \n My merits thanklesse thus with mee be buryed in the dust? \n Nay, doo not so. But to th'entent my death dew honour have, \n Let Polyxene in sacrifyse bee slayne uppon my grave. \n Thus much he sayd: and shortly his companions dooing as \n By vision of his cruell ghost commaundment given them was, \n Did fetch her from her mothers lappe, whom at that tyme, well neere, \n In that most great adversitie alonly shee did cheere. \n The haultye and unhappye mayd, and rather to bee thought \n A man than woman, to the tumb with cruell hands was brought, \n To make a cursed sacrifyse. Whoo mynding constantly \n Her honour, when shee standing at the Altar prest to dye, \n Perceyvd the savage ceremonies in making ready, and \n The cruell Neoptolemus with naked swoord in hand \n Stand staring with ungentle eyes uppon her gentle face, \n She sayd: Now use thou when thou wilt my gentle blood. The cace \n Requyres no more delay. Bestow thy weapon in my chest, \n Or in my throte: (in saying so shee proferred bare her brest, \n And eeke her throte). Assure your selves it never shalbee seene, \n That any wyght shall (by my will) have slave of Polyxeene. \n Howbee't with such a sacrifyse no God yee can delyght. \n I would desyre no more but that my wretched moother myght \n Bee ignorant of this my death.

Uppon him speaking so, \n And swearing and forswearing too, shee looked sternely tho, \n And beeing sore inflaamd with wrath, caught hold uppon him, and \n Streyght calling out for succor to the wyves of Troy at hand \n Did in the traytors face bestowe her nayles, and scratched out \n His eyes, her anger gave her hart and made her strong and stout. \n Shee thrust her fingars in as farre as could bee, and did bore \n Not now his eyes (for why his eyes were pulled out before) \n But bothe the places of the eyes berayd with wicked blood. \n The Thracians at theyr Tyrannes harme for anger wexing wood, \n Began to scare the Trojane wyves with darts and stones.

Neyther (if demaunded it should bee) \n I well were able for to tell you whither that the love \n Of Acis , or the Cyclops hate did more my stomacke move. \n There was no oddes betweene them. Oh deere Goddesse Venus, what \n A powre haste thou? Behold how even this owgly Giant that \n No sparke of meekenesse in him hath, whoo is a terrour to \n The verrye woodes, whom never guest nor straunger came unto \n Without displeasure, whoo the heavens and all the Goddes despyseth, \n Dooth feele what thing is love. The love of mee him so surpryseth, \n That Polypheme regarding not his sheepe and hollowe Cave, \n And having care to please dooth go about to make him brave. \n His sturre stiffe heare he kembeth nowe with strong and sturdy rakes, \n And with a sythe dooth marcussotte his bristled berd: and takes \n Delyght to looke uppon himself in waters, and to frame \n His countnance. Of his murtherous hart the wyldnesse wexeth tame. \n His unastaunched thyrst of blood is quenched: shippes may passe \n And repasse saufly. In the whyle that he in love thus was, \n One Telemus, Ewrymeds sonne, a man of passing skill \n In birdflyght, taking land that tyme in Sicill, went untill \n The orped Gyant Polypheme, and sayd: This one round eye \n That now amid thy forehead stands shall one day ere thou dye \n By sly Ulysses blinded bee. The Gyant laught therat, \n And sayd: O foolish soothsayre, thou deceyved art in that. \n For why another (even a wench) already hathe it blynded. \n Thus skorning him that told him truthe bycause he was hygh mynded, \n He eyther made the ground to shake in walking on the shore, \n Or rowzd him in his shadye Cave. With wedged poynt before \n There shoots a hill into the Sea: whereof the sea dooth beate \n On eyther syde. The one eyd feend came up and made his seate \n Theron, and after came his sheepe undriven. As soone as hee \n Had at his foote layd downe his staffe which was a whole Pyne tree \n Well able for to bee a maast to any shippe, he takes \n His pype compact of fyvescore reedes, and therwithall he makes \n So loud a noyse that all the hilles and waters therabout \n Myght easly heere the shirlnesse of the shepeherds whistling out. \n I lying underneathe the rocke, and leaning in the lappe \n Of Acis markt theis woordes of his which farre I heard by happe: \n More whyght thou art then Primrose leaf, my Lady Galatee. \n More fresh than meade, more tall and streyght than lofty Aldertree. \n More bright than glasse, more wanton than the tender kid forsooth. \n Than Cockleshelles continually with water worne, more smoothe. \n More cheerefull than the winters Sun, or Sommers shadowe cold, \n More seemely and more comly than the Planetree to behold, \n Of valew more than Apples bee although they were of gold. \n More cleere than frozen yce, more sweete than Grape through rype ywis, \n More soft than butter newly made, or downe of Cygnet is. \n And much more fayre and beawtyfull than gardein to myne eye, \n But that thou from my companye continually doost flye. \n And thou the selfsame Galate art more tettish for to frame \n Than Oxen of the wildernesse whom never wyght did tame. \n More fleeting than the waves, more hard than warryed Oke to twyne, \n More tough than willow twiggs, more lyth than is the wyld whyght vyne. \n More than this rocke unmovable, more violent than a streame. \n More prowd than Peacocke praysd, more feerce than fyre and more extreeme. \n More rough than Breers, more cruell than the new delivered Beare, \n More mercilesse than troden snake, than sea more deafe of eare. \n And which (and if it lay in mee I cheefly would restrayne) \n Not only swifter paced than the stag in chace on playne, \n But also swifter than the wynd and flyghtfull ayre. But if \n Thou knew me well, it would thee irke to flye and bee a greef \n To tarrye from mee. Yea thou wouldst endeavour all thy powre \n To keepe mee wholly to thy self. The Quarry is my bowre \n Heawen out of whole mayne stone. No Sun in sommer there can swelt. \n No nipping cold in wintertyme within the same is felt. \n Gay Apples weying downe the boughes have I, and Grapes like gold, \n And purple Grapes on spreaded Vynes as many as can hold. \n Bothe which I doo reserve for thee. Thyself shalt with thy hand \n The soft sweete strawbryes gather, which in wooddy shadowe stand. \n The Cornell berryes also from the tree thy self shall pull: \n And pleasant plommes, sum yellow lyke new wax, sum blew, sum full \n Of ruddy jewce. Of Chestnutts eeke (if my wyfe thou wilt bee) \n Thou shalt have store: and frutes all sortes: all trees shall serve for thee. \n This Cattell heere is all myne owne. And many mo besyde \n Doo eyther in the bottoms feede, or in the woodes them hyde, \n And many standing at theyr stalles doo in my Cave abyde. \n The number of them (if a man should ask) I cannot showe. \n Tush, beggars of theyr Cattell use the number for to knowe. \n And for the goodnesse of the same, no whit beleeve thou mee. \n But come thyself (and if thou wilt) the truth therof to see. \n See how theyr udders full doo make them straddle. Lesser ware \n Shet up at home in cloce warme peends, are Lambes. There also are \n In other pinfolds Kidds of selfsame yeaning tyme. Thus have \n I alwayes mylke as whyte as snow. Wherof I sum doo save \n To drink, and of the rest is made good cheese. And furthermore \n Not only stale and common gifts and pleasures wherof store \n Is to bee had at eche mannes hand, (as Leverets, Kidds, and Does, \n A payre of pigeons, or a nest of birds new found, or Roes,) \n Shall unto thee presented bee. I found this tother day \n A payre of Bearewhelpes, eche so lyke the other as they lay \n Uppon a hill, that scarce yee eche discerne from other may. \n And when that I did fynd them I did take them up, and say \n Theis will I for my Lady keepe for her therwith to play. \n Now put thou up thy fayre bryght head, good Galat, I thee pray, \n Above the greenish waves: now come my Galat, come away. \n And of my present take no scorne. I know my selfe to bee \n A jollye fellow. For even now I did behold and see \n Myne image in the water sheere, and sure mee thought I tooke \n Delyght to see my goodly shape, and favor in the brooke. \n Behold how big I am: not Jove in heaven (for so you men \n Report one Jove to reigne, of whom I passe not for to ken) \n Is huger than this doughty corce of myne. A bush of heare \n Dooth overdreepe my visage grim, and shadowes as it were \n A grove uppon my shoulders twayne. And think it not to bee \n A shame for that with bristled heare my body rough yee see. \n A fowle ilfavored syght it is to see a leavelesse tree. \n A lothely thing it is, a horse without a mane to keepe. \n As fethers doo become the birdes, and wooll becommeth sheepe, \n Even so a beard and bristled skin becommeth also men. \n I have but one eye, which dooth stand amid my frunt. What then? \n This one round eye of myne is lyke a myghty target. Why? \n Vewes not the Sun all things from heaven? Yit but one only eye \n Hath hee. Moreover in your Seas my father beares the sway. \n Him will I make thy fathrinlaw. Have mercy I thee pray, \n And harken to myne humble sute. For only unto thee \n Yeeld I. Even I of whom bothe heaven and Jove despysed bee \n And eeke the percing thunderbolt, doo stand in awe and feare \n Of thee, O Nerye. Thyne ill will is greevouser to beare \n Than is the deadly Thunderclappe. Yit could I better fynd \n In hart to suffer this contempt of thyne with pacient mynd \n If thou didst shonne all other folk as well as mee. But why \n Rejecting Cyclops doost thou love dwarf Acis ? Why say I \n Preferst thou Acis unto mee? Well, let him liked bee \n Both of himself, and also (which I would be lothe) of thee. \n And if I catch him he shall feele that in my body is \n The force that should bee. I shall paunch him quicke. Those limbes of his \n I will in peeces teare, and strew them in the feeldes, and in \n Thy waters, if he doo thee haunt. For I doo swelt within. \n And being chaafte the flame dooth burne more feerce to my unrest. \n Mee thinks mount Aetna with his force is closed in my brest. \n And yit it nothing moveth thee. As soone as he had talkt \n Thus much in vayne, (I sawe well all) he rose: and fuming stalkt \n Among his woodes and woonted Lawndes, as dooth a Bulchin, when \n The Cow is from him tane. He could him no where rest as then. \n Anon the feend espyed mee and Acis where wee lay, \n Before wee wist or feared it: and crying out gan say: \n I see yee. And confounded myght I bee with endlesse shame, \n But if I make this day the last agreement of your game. \n Theis woordes were spoke with such a reere as verry well became \n An angry Giant. Aetna shooke with lowdnesse of the same. \n I scaard therwith dopt underneathe the water, and the knyght \n Simethus turning streyght his backe, did give himself to flyght, \n And cryed: Help mee Galate, help parents I you pray, \n And in your kingdome mee receyve whoo perrish must streyghtway. \n The roundeyd devill made pursewt: and rending up a fleece \n Of Aetna Rocke, threw after him: of which a little peece \n Did Acis overtake. And yit as little as it was, \n It overwhelmed Acis whole. I wretched wyght (alas) \n Did that which destnyes would permit. Foorthwith I brought to passe \n That Acis should receyve the force his father had before. \n His scarlet blood did issue from the lump, and more and more \n Within a whyle the rednesse gan to vannish: and the hew \n Resembled at the first a brooke with rayne distroubled new, \n Which wexeth cleere by length of tyme. Anon the lump did clyve, \n And from the hollow cliffe therof hygh reedes sprang up alyve. \n And at the hollow issue of the stone the bubling water \n Came trickling out. And by and by (which is a woondrous matter) \n The stripling with a wreath of reede about his horned head \n Avaunst his body to the waste. Whoo (save he was that stead \n Much biggar than he erst had beene, and altogither gray) \n Was Acis still. And being turnd to water, at this day \n In shape of river still he beares his former name away.\n\n \n",

And woondring at his colour and his heare \n With which his shoulders and his backe all wholly covered were, \n Shee saw his neather parts were like a fish with tayle wrythde round \n Who leaning to the neerest Rocke, sayd thus with lowd cleere sound: \n Fayre mayd, I neyther monster am nor cruell savage beast: \n But of the sea a God, whoose powre and favour is not least. \n For neyther Protew in the sea nor Triton have more myght \n Nor yit the sonne of Athamas that now Palaemon hyght. \n Yit once I was a mortall man. But you must know that I \n Was given to seawoorkes, and in them mee only did apply. \n For sumtyme I did draw the drag in which the fishes were, \n And sumtyme sitting on the cliffes I angled heere and there. \n There butteth on a fayre greene mede a bank wherof t'one half \n Is cloasd with sea, the rest is clad with herbes which never calf, \n Nor horned Ox, nor seely sheepe, nor shakheard Goate did feede. \n The busye Bee did never there of flowres sweet smelling speede. \n No gladsum garlonds ever there were gathered for the head. \n No hand those flowers ever yit with hooked sythe did shred. \n I was the first that ever set my foote uppon that plot. \n Now as I dryde my dropping netts, and layd abrode my lotte, \n To tell how many fishes had bychaunce to net beene sent, \n Or through theyr owne too lyght beeleefe on bayted hooke beene hent: \n (The matter seemeth like a lye, but what avayles to lye?) \n As soone as that my pray had towcht the grasse, it by and by \n Began to move, and flask theyr finnes, and swim uppon the drye, \n As in the Sea. And as I pawsd and woondred at the syght, \n My draught of fishes everychone to seaward tooke theyr flyght, \n And leaping from the shore, forsooke theyr newfound mayster quyght. \n I was amazed at the thing: and standing long in dowt, \n I sought the cause if any God had brought this same abowt, \n Or else sum jewce of herb. And as I so did musing stand, \n What herb (quoth I) hath such a powre? And gathering with my hand \n The grasse, I bote it with my toothe. My throte had scarcely yit \n Well swallowed downe the uncouth jewce, when like an agew fit \n I felt myne inwards soodeinly to shake, and with the same, \n A love of other nature in my brest with violence came. \n And long I could it not resist, but sayd: Deere land, adeew, \n For never shall I haunt thee more. And with that woord I threw \n My bodye in the sea. The Goddes thereof receyving mee, \n Vouchsaved in theyr order mee installed for to bee, \n Desyring old Oceanus and Thetis for theyr sake, \n The rest of my mortalitie away from mee to take. \n They hallowed mee, and having sayd nyne tymes the holy ryme \n That purgeth all prophanednesse, they charged mee that tyme \n To put my brestbulk underneathe a hundred streames. Anon \n The brookes from sundry coastes and all the Seas did ryde uppon \n My head. From whence as soone as I returned, by and by \n I felt my self farre otherwyse through all my limbes, than I \n Had beene before. And in my mynd I was another man. \n Thus farre of all that mee befell make just report I can. \n Thus farre I beare in mynd. The rest my mynd perceyved not. \n Then first of all this hory greene gray grisild beard I got, \n And this same bush of heare which all along the seas I sweepe, \n And theis same myghty shoulders, and theis grayish armes, and feete \n Confounded into finned fish. But what avayleth mee \n This goodly shape, and of the Goddes of sea to loved bee? \n Or for to be a God my self, if they delyght not thee? \n As he was speaking this, and still about to utter more, \n Dame Scylla him forsooke: wherat he wexing angry sore, \n And beeing quickened with repulse, in rage he tooke his way \n To Circes, Titans daughters, Court which full of monsters lay. \n"

In this same place he found a mate \n Of wyse Ulysses, Macare of Neritus, whoo late \n Before, had after all his long and tediouse toyles, there stayd. \n He spying Achemenides (whom late ago afrayd \n They had among mount Aetnas Cliffs abandond when they fled \n From Polypheme): and woondring for to see he was not dead, \n Sayd thus: O Achemenides, what chaunce, or rather what \n Good God hathe savde the lyfe of thee? What is the reason that \n A barbrous shippe beares thee a Greeke? Or whither saylest thou? \n To him thus, Achemenides, his owne man freely now \n And not forgrowen as one forlorne, nor clad in bristled hyde, \n Made answer: Yit ageine I would I should in perrill byde \n Of Polypheme, and that I myght those chappes of his behold \n Beesmeared with the blood of men, but if that I doo hold \n This shippe more deere than all the Realme of wyse Ulysses, or \n If lesser of Aenaeas I doo make account than for \n My father, neyther (though I did as much as doone myght bee,) \n I could ynough bee thankfull for his goodnesse towards mee. \n That I still speake and breathe, that I the Sun and heaven doo see, \n Is his gift.

I did see him from a cragged mountaine strippe \n A myghty rocke, and into sea it throwe midway and more. \n Ageine I sawe his giants pawe throwe huge big stones great store \n As if it were a sling. And sore I feared lest your shippe \n Should drowned by the water bee that from the stones did skippe, \n Or by the stones themselves, as if my self had beene therin. \n But when that flyght had saved you from death, he did begin \n On Aetna syghing up and downe to walke: and with his pawes \n Went groping of the trees among the woodes. And forbycause \n He could not see, he knockt his shinnes ageinst the rocks eche where. \n And stretching out his grisly armes (which all beegrymed were \n With baken blood) to seaward, he the Greekish nation band, \n And sayd: O if that sum good chaunce myght bring unto my hand \n Ulysses or sum mate of his, on whom to wreake myne ire, \n Uppon whose bowells with my teeth I like a Hawke myght tyre: \n Whose living members myght with theis my talants teared beene: \n Whoose blood myght bubble down my throte: whose flesh myght pant between \n My jawes: how lyght or none at all this losing of myne eye \n Would seeme.

But none of them was to bee feared there. \n For none of them could doo us harme: but with a gentle looke \n And following us with fawning feete theyr wanton tayles they shooke. \n Anon did Damzells welcome us and led us through the hall \n (The which was made of marble stone, floore, arches, roof, and wall) \n To Circe. Shee sate underneathe a traverse in a chayre \n Aloft ryght rich and stately, in a chamber large and fayre. \n Shee ware a goodly longtreynd gowne: and all her rest attyre \n Was every whit of goldsmithes woork. There sate mee also by her \n The Sea nymphes and her Ladyes whoose fyne fingers never knew \n What toozing wooll did meene, nor threede from whorled spindle drew. \n They sorted herbes, and picking out the flowers that were mixt, \n Did put them into mawnds, and with indifferent space betwixt \n Did lay the leaves and stalks on heapes according to theyr hew, \n And shee herself the woork of them did oversee and vew. \n The vertue and the use of them ryght perfectly shee knew, \n And in what leaf it lay, and which in mixture would agree. \n And so perusing every herb by good advysement, shee \n Did wey them out.

Which doone, and that the cursed witch had smit \n Our highest heare tippes with her wand, (it is a shame, but yit \n I will declare the truth) I wext all rough with bristled heare, \n And could not make complaint with woordes. In stead of speech I there \n Did make a rawghtish grunting, and with groveling face gan beare \n My visage downeward to the ground. I felt a hooked groyne \n To wexen hard uppon my mouth, and brawned neck to joyne \n My head and shoulders. And the handes with which I late ago \n Had taken up the charmed cup, were turnd to feete as tho. \n Such force there is in Sorcerie.

And so \n Should none have borne Ulysses woorde of our mischaunce, nor hee \n Have come to Circe to revenge our harmes and set us free. \n The peaceprocurer Mercurie had given to him a whyght \n Fayre flowre whoose roote is black, and of the Goddes it Moly hyght \n Assurde by this and heavenly hestes, he entred Circes bowre. \n And beeing bidden for to drink the cup of baleful powre, \n As Circe was about to stroke her wand uppon his heare, \n He thrust her backe, and put her with his naked swoord in feare. \n Then fell they to agreement streyght, and fayth in hand was plyght. \n And beeing made her bedfellowe, he claymed as in ryght \n Of dowrye, for to have his men ageine in perfect plyght. \n Shee sprincled us with better jewce of uncowth herbes, and strake \n The awk end of her charmed rod uppon our heades, and spake \n Woordes to the former contrarie. The more shee charmd, the more \n Arose wee upward from the ground on which wee daarde before. \n Our bristles fell away, the clift our cloven clees forsooke. \n Our shoulders did returne agein: and next our elbowes tooke \n Our armes and handes theyr former place.

Wee taryed theyr a yeere. \n I in that whyle sawe many things, and many things did heere. \n I marked also this one thing with store of other geere \n Which one of Circes fowre cheef maydes (whoose office was alway \n Uppon such hallowes to attend) did secretly bewray \n To mee. For in the whyle my Lord with Circe kept alone, \n This mayd a yoongmannes image sheawd of fayre whyght marble stone \n Within a Chauncell. On the head therof were garlonds store \n And eeke a woodspecke. And as I demaunded her wherfore \n And whoo it was they honord so in holy Church, and why \n He bare that bird uppon his head: shee answeering by and by \n Sayd: Lerne hereby, sir Macare, to understand the powre \n My lady hathe, and marke thou well what I shall say this howre.\n\n \n",
            "5":"\n\n There reignd erewhyle in Italy one Picus, Saturnes sonne, \n Whoo loved warlike horse and had delyght to see them ronne. \n He was of feature as yee see. And by this image heere \n The verry beawtye of the man dooth lyvelely appeere. \n His courage matcht his personage. And scarcely had he well \n Seene twentye yeeres. His countnance did allure the nymphes that dwell \n Among the Latian hilles. The nymphes of fountaines and of brookes, \n As those that haunted Albula were ravisht with his lookes \n And so were they that Numicke beares, and Anio too, and Alme \n That ronneth short, and heady Nar, and Farfar coole and calme. \n And all the nymphes that usde to haunt Dianas shadye poole, \n Or any lakes or meeres neere hand, or other waters coole. \n But he disdeyning all the rest did set his love uppon \n A lady whom Venilia bare (so fame reporteth) on \n The stately mountayne Palatine by Janus that dooth beare \n The dowble face. Assoone as that her yeeres for maryage were \n Thought able, shee preferring him before all other men, \n Was wedded to this Picus whoo was king of Lawrents then. \n Shee was in beawtve excellent, but yit in singing, much \n More excellent: and theruppon they naamd her Singer. Such \n The sweetenesse of her musicke was, that shee therwith delyghts \n The savage beastes, and caused birdes to cease theyr wandring flyghts, \n And moved stones and trees, and made the ronning streames to stay. \n Now whyle that shee in womans tune recordes her pleasant lay \n At home, her husband rode abrode uppon a lustye horse \n To hunt the Boare, and bare in hand twoo hunting staves of force. \n His cloke was crymzen butned with a golden button fast. \n Into the selfsame forest eeke was Phebus daughter past \n From those same feeldes that of herself the name of Circe beare, \n To gather uncowth herbes among the fruteful hillocks there. \n As soone as lurking in the shrubbes shee did the king espye, \n Shee was astrawght. Downe fell her herbes to ground. And by and by \n Through all her bones the flame of love the maree gan to frye. \n And when shee from this forced heate had cald her witts agen, \n Shee purposde to bewray her mynd. But unto him as then \n Shee could not come for swiftnesse of his horse and for his men \n That garded him on every syde. Yit shalt thou not (quoth shee) \n So shift thee fro my handes although the wynd should carrye thee, \n If I doo knowe myself, if all the strength of herbes fayle not, \n Or if I have not quyght and cleene my charmes and spelles forgotte. \n In saying theis same wordes, shee made the likenesse of a Boare \n Without a body, causing it to swiftly passe before \n King Picus eyes, and for to seeme to get him to the woode, \n Where for the thickenesse of the trees a horse myght do no good. \n Immediatly the king unwares a hote pursute did make \n Uppon the shadowe of his pray, and quikly did forsake \n His foming horses sweating backe: and following vayne wan hope, \n Did runne afoote among the woodes, and through the bushes crope. \n Then Circe fell a mumbling spelles, and praying like a witch \n Did honour straunge and uncowth Goddes with uncowth charmes, by which \n Shee usde to make the moone looke dark, and wrappe her fathers head \n In watry clowdes. And then likewyse the heaven was overspred \n With darknesse, and a foggye mist steamd upward from the ground. \n And nere a man about the king to gard him could bee found, \n But every man in blynd bywayes ran scattring in the chace, \n Through her inchauntments. At the length shee getting tyme and place, \n Sayd: By those lyghtsum eyes of thyne which late have ravisht myne, \n And by that goodly personage and lovely face of thyne, \n The which compelleth mee that am a Goddesse to enclyne \n To make this humble sute to thee that art a mortall wyght, \n Asswage my flame, and make this sonne (whoo by his heavenly syght \n Foresees all things) thy fathrinlawe: and hardly hold not scorne \n Of Circe whoo by long discent of Titans stocke am borne. \n Thus much sayd Circe. He ryght feerce rejecting her request, \n And her, sayd: Whooso ere thou art, go set thy hart at rest. \n I am not thyne, nor will not bee. Another holdes my hart: \n And long God graunt shee may it hold, that I may never start \n To leawdnesse of a forreigne lust from bond of lawfull bed, \n As long as Janus daughter, my sweete Singer, is not dead. \n Dame Circe having oft renewd her sute in vayne beefore, \n Sayd: Dearely shalt thou bye thy scorne. For never shalt thou more \n Returne to Singer. Thou shalt lerne by proof what one can doo \n That is provoked, and in love, yea and a woman too. \n But Circe is bothe stird to wrath, and also tane in love, \n Yea and a woman. Twyce her face to westward she did move, \n And twyce to Eastward. Thryce shee layd her rod uppon his head. \n And therwithall three charmes shee cast. Away king Picus fled. \n And woondring that he fled more swift than earst he had beene woont, \n He saw the fethers on his skin, and at the sodein brunt \n Became a bird that haunts the wooddes. Wherat he taking spyght, \n With angrye bill did job uppon hard Okes with all his myght, \n And in his moode made hollowe holes uppon theyr boughes. The hew \n Of Crimzen which was in his cloke, uppon his fethers grew. \n The gold that was a clasp and did his cloke toogither hold, \n Is fethers, and about his necke goes circlewyse like gold. \n His servants luring in that whyle oft over all the ground \n In vayne, and fynding no where of theyr kyng no inkling, found \n Dame Circe. (For by that tyme shee had made the ayer sheere, \n And suffred both the sonne and wyndes the mistye steames to cleere) \n And charging her with matter trew, demaunded for theyr kyng, \n And offring force, began theyr darts and Javelings for to fling. \n Shee sprincling noysom venim streyght and jewce of poysoning myght, \n Did call togither Eribus and Chaos, and the nyght, \n And all the feendes of darknesse, and with howling out along \n Made prayers unto Hecate. Scarce ended was her song, \n But that (a woondrous thing to tell) the woodes lept from theyr place. \n The ground did grone: the trees neere hand lookt pale in all the chace: \n The grasse besprent with droppes of blood lookt red: the stones did seem \n To roare and bellow horce: and doggs to howle and raze extreeme: \n And all the ground to crawle with snakes blacke scaalde: and gastly spryghts \n Fly whisking up and downe. The folke were flayghted at theis syghts. \n And as they woondring stood amaazd, shee strokte her witching wand \n Uppon theyr faces. At the touche wherof, there out of hand \n Came woondrous shapes of savage beastes uppon them all. Not one \n Reteyned still his native shape. The setting sonne was gone \n Beyond the utmost coast of Spaine, and Singer longd in vayne \n To see her husband. Bothe her folke and people ran agayne \n Through all the woodes. And ever as they went, they sent theyr eyes \n Before them for to fynd him out, but no man him espyes. \n Then Singer thought it not ynough to weepe and teare her heare, \n And beat herself (all which shee did). Shee gate abrode, and there \n Raundgd over all the broade wyld feelds like one besyds her witts. \n Six nyghts and full as many dayes (as fortune led by fitts) \n She strayd mee over hilles and dales, and never tasted rest, \n Nor meate, nor drink of all the whyle. The seventh day, sore opprest \n And tyred bothe with travell and with sorrowe, downe shee sate \n Uppon cold Tybers bank, and there with teares in moorning rate \n Shee warbling on her greef in tune not shirle nor over hye, \n Did make her moane, as dooth the swan: whoo ready for to dye \n Dooth sing his buriall song before. Her maree molt at last \n With moorning, and shee pynde away: and finally shee past \n To lither ayre. But yit her fame remayned in the place. \n For why the auncient husbandmen according to the cace, \n Did name it Singer of the nymph that dyed in the same. \n Of such as these are, many things that yeere by fortune came \n Bothe to my heering and my sight. Wee wexing resty then \n And sluggs by discontinuance, were commaunded yit agen \n To go aboord and hoyse up sayles. And Circe told us all \n That long and dowtfull passage and rowgh seas should us befall. \n I promis thee those woordes of hers mee throughly made afrayd: \n And therfore hither I mee gate, and heere I have mee stayd.\n\n \n",

But Venulus in vayne \n To outcast Diomeds citie went his succour to obteine. \n This Diomed under Dawnus, king of Calabrye, did found \n A myghtye towne, and with his wyfe in dowrye hild the ground. \n Now when from Turnus, Venulus his message had declaard, \n Desyring help: th'Aetolian knyght sayd none could well bee spaard. \n And in excuce, he told him how he neyther durst be bold \n To prest his fathers folk to warre of whom he had no hold, \n Nor any of his countrymen had left as then alyve \n To arme. And lest yee think (quoth hee) I doo a shift contryve, \n Although by uppening of the thing my bitter greef revyve \n I will abyde to make a new rehersall. After that \n The Greekes had burned Troy and on the ground had layd it flat, \n And that the Prince of Narix by his ravishing the mayd \n In Pallas temple, on us all the pennance had displayd \n Which he himself deservd alone: then scattred heere and there \n And harryed over all the seas, wee Greekes were fayne to beare \n Nyght, thunder, tempest, wrath of heaven and sea, and last of all \n Sore shipwrecke at mount Capharey to mend our harmes withall. \n And lest that mee to make too long a processe yee myght deeme \n In setting forth our heavy happes, the Greekes myght that tyme seeme \n Ryght rewfull even to Priamus. Howbee't Minerva, shee \n That weareth armour, tooke mee from the waves and saved mee. \n But from my fathers Realme ageine by violence I was driven. \n For Venus bearing still in mynd the wound I had her given \n Long tyme before, did woork revendge. By meanes wherof such toyle \n Did tosse mee on the sea, and on the land I found such broyle \n By warres, that in my hart I thought them blist of God whom erst \n The violence of the raging sea and hideous wynds had perst, \n And whom the wrathfull Capharey by shipwrecke did confound: \n Oft wisshing also I had there among the rest beene drownd. \n My company now having felt the woorst that sea or warre \n Could woorke, did faynt, and wisht an end of straying out so farre. \n But Agmon hot of nature and too feerce through slaughters made \n Sayd: What remayneth, sirs, through which our pacience cannot wade? \n What further spyght hath Venus yit to woork ageinst us more? \n When woorse misfortunes may be feard than have beene felt before, \n Then prayer may advauntadge men, and vowwing may then boote. \n But when the woorst is past of things, then feare is under foote. \n And when that bale is hyghest growne, then boote must next ensew. \n Although shee heere mee, and doo hate us all (which thing is trew) \n That serve heere under Diomed: Yit set wee lyght her hate. \n And deerely it should stand us on to purchase hygh estate. \n With such stowt woordes did Agmon stirre dame Venus unto ire \n And raysd ageine her settled grudge. Not many had desyre \n To heere him talk thus out of square. The moste of us that are \n His freendes rebukte him for his woordes. And as he did prepare \n To answere, bothe his voyce and throte by which his voyce should go, \n Were small: his heare to feathers turnd: his necke was clad as tho \n With feathers: so was brist and backe. The greater fethers stacke \n Uppon his armes: and into wings his elbowes bowwed backe. \n The greatest portion of his feete was turned into toes. \n A hardened bill of horne did growe uppon his mouth and noze, \n And sharpened at the neather end. His fellowes, Lycus, Ide, \n Rethenor, Nyct, and Abas all stood woondring by his syde. \n And as they woondred, they receyvd the selfsame shape and hew. \n And finally the greater part of all my band up flew, \n And clapping with theyr newmade wings, about the ores did gird. \n And if yee doo demaund the shape of this same dowtfull bird, \n Even as they bee not verry Swannnes: so drawe they verry neere \n The shape of Cygnets whyght.

And as shee hilld \n The reynes that rulde the Lyons tame which drew her charyot, shee \n Sayd thus: O Turnus, all in vayne theis wicked hands of thee \n Doo cast this fyre. For by myself dispoynted it shall bee. \n I wilnot let the wasting fyre consume theis shippes which are \n A parcell of my forest Ide of which I am most chare. \n It thundred as the Goddesse spake, and with the thunder came \n A storme of rayne and skipping hayle, and soodeyne with the same \n The sonnes of Astrey meeting feerce and feyghting verry sore, \n Did trouble bothe the sea and ayre and set them on a rore. \n Dame Cybel using one of them to serve her turne that tyde, \n Did breake the Cables at the which the Trojane shippes did ryde, \n And bare them prone, and underneathe the water did them dryve. \n The Timber of them softning turnd to bodyes streyght alyve. \n The stemmes were turnd to heades, the ores to swimming feete and toes, \n The sydes to ribbes, the keele that through the middle gaily goes \n Became the ridgebone of the backe, the sayles and tackling, heare: \n And into armes on eyther syde the sayleyards turned were. \n Theyr hew is duskye as before, and now in shape of mayd \n They play among the waves of which even now they were afrayd. \n And beeing Sea nymphes, wheras they were bred in mountaynes hard, \n They haunt for ay the water soft, and never afterward \n Had mynd to see theyr natyve soyle. But yit forgetting not \n How many perills they had felt on sea by lucklesse lot, \n They often put theyr helping hand to shippes distrest by wynd, \n Onlesse that any caryed Greekes. For bearing still in mynd \n The burning of the towne of Troy , they hate the Greekes by kynd. \n And therfore of Ulysses shippes ryght glad they were to see \n The shivers, and as glad they were as any glad myght bee, \n To see Alcinous shippes wex hard and turned into stone. \n Theis shippes thus having gotten lyfe and beeing turnd each one \n To nymphes, a body would have thought the miracle so greate \n Should into Turnus wicked hart sum godly feare have beate, \n And made him cease his wilfull warre. But he did still persist. \n And eyther partye had theyr Goddes theyr quarrell to assist, \n And courage also: which as good as Goddes myght well be thought. \n In fyne they neyther for the Realme nor for the scepter sought, \n Nor for the Lady Lavine: but for conquest. And for shame \n To seeme to shrinke in leaving warre, they still prolongd the same. \n At length dame Venus sawe her sonne obteyne the upper hand. \n King Turnus fell, and eeke the towne of Ardea which did stand \n Ryght strong in hygh estate as long as Turnus lived. But \n Assoone as that Aenaeas swoord to death had Turnus put, \n The towne was set on fyre: and from amid the embers flew \n A fowle which till that present tyme no persone ever knew, \n And beete the ashes feercely up with flapping of his wing. \n The leanenesse, palenesse, dolefull sound, and every other thing \n That may expresse a Citie sakt, yea and the Cities name \n Remayned still unto the bird.

And to th'entent thou may \n The more beware, of many things which tyme by long delay \n Hathe taught mee, I will shewe thee one which over all the land \n Of Cyprus blazed is abrode, which being ryghtly skand \n May easly bow thy hardned hart and make it for to yild.\n\n \n",

            "1":"\n\n Heere dwelt a man of Samos Ile, who for the hate he had \n To Lordlynesse and Tyranny, though unconstreynd was glad \n To make himself a bannisht man. And though this persone weere \n Farre distant from the Goddes by site of heaven: yit came he neere \n To them in mynd. And he by syght of soule and reason cleere \n Behild the things which nature dooth to fleshly eyes denye. \n And when with care most vigilant he had assuredly \n Imprinted all things in his hart, he set them openly \n Abroade for other folk to lerne. He taught his silent sort \n (Which woondred at the heavenly woordes theyr mayster did report) \n The first foundation of the world: the cause of every thing: \n What nature was: and what was God: whence snow and lyghtning spring: \n And whither Jove or else the wynds in breaking clowdes doo thunder: \n What shakes the earth: what law the starres doo keepe theyr courses under: \n And what soever other thing is hid from common sence. \n He also is the first that did injoyne an abstinence \n To feede of any lyving thing. He also first of all \n Spake thus: although ryght lernedly, yit to effect but small: \n Yee mortall men, forbeare to frank your flesh with wicked foode. \n Yee have both come and frutes of trees and grapes and herbes right good. \n And though that sum bee harsh and hard: yit fyre may make them well \n Both soft and sweete. Yee may have milk, and honny which dooth smell \n Of flowres of tyme. The lavish earth dooth yeeld you plentiously \n Most gentle foode, and riches to content bothe mynd and eye. \n There needes no slaughter nor no blood to get your living by. \n The beastes do breake theyr fast with flesh: and yit not all beastes neyther. \n For horses, sheepe, and Rotherbeastes to live by grasse had lever. \n The nature of the beast that dooth delyght in bloody foode, \n Is cruell and unmercifull. As Lyons feerce of moode, \n Armenian Tigers, Beares, and Woolves. Oh, what a wickednesse \n It is to cram the mawe with mawe, and frank up flesh with flesh, \n And for one living thing to live by killing of another: \n As whoo should say, that of so great abundance which our moother \n The earth dooth yeeld most bountuously, none other myght delyght \n Thy cruell teethe to chawe uppon, than grisly woundes that myght \n Expresse the Cyclops guyse? or else as if thou could not stawnche \n The hunger of thy greedye gut and evill mannerd pawnche, \n Onlesse thou stroyd sum other wyght. But that same auncient age \n Which wee have naamd the golden world, cleene voyd of all such rage, \n Livd blessedly by frute of trees and herbes that grow on ground, \n And stayned not their mouthes with blood. Then birds might safe and sound \n Fly where they listed in the ayre. The hare unscaard of hound \n Went pricking over all the feeldes. No angling hooke with bayt \n Did hang the seely fish that bote mistrusting no deceyt. \n All things were voyd of guylefulnesse: no treason was in trust: \n But all was freendshippe, love and peace. But after that the lust \n Of one (what God so ere he was) disdeyning former fare, \n To cram that cruell croppe of his with fleshmeate did not spare, \n He made a way for wickednesse. And first of all the knyfe \n Was staynd with blood of savage beastes in ridding them of lyfe. \n And that had nothing beene amisse, if there had beene the stay. \n For why wee graunt, without the breach of godlynesse wee may \n By death confound the things that seeke to take our lyves away. \n But as to kill them reason was: even so agein theyr was \n No reason why to eate theyr flesh. This leawdnesse thence did passe \n On further still. Wheras there was no sacrifyse beforne, \n The Swyne (bycause with hoked groyne he rooted up the come, \n And did deceyve the tillmen of theyr hope next yeere thereby) \n Was deemed woorthy by desert in sacrifyse to dye. \n The Goate for byghting vynes was slayne at Bacchus altar whoo \n Wreakes such misdeedes. Theyr owne offence was hurtful to theis two. \n But what have you poore sheepe misdoone, a cattell meeke and meeld, \n Created for to maynteine man, whoose fulsomme duggs doo yeeld \n Sweete Nectar, whoo dooth clothe us with your wooll in soft aray? \n Whoose lyfe dooth more us benefite than dooth your death farreway? \n What trespasse have the Oxen doone, a beast without all guyle \n Or craft, unhurtfull, simple, borne to labour every whyle? \n In fayth he is unmyndfull and unwoorthy of increace \n Of come, that in his hart can fynd his tilman to releace \n From plowgh, to cut his throte: that in his hart can fynde (I say) \n Those neckes with hatchets off to strike, whoose skinne is worne away \n With labring ay for him: whoo turnd so oft his land most tough, \n Whoo brought so many harvestes home. Yit is it not ynough \n That such a great outrageousenesse committed is. They father \n Theyr wickednesse uppon the Goddes. And falsly they doo gather \n That in the death of peynfull Ox the Hyghest dooth delyght. \n A sacrifyse unblemished and fayrest unto syght, \n (For beawtye woorketh them theyr bane) adornd with garlonds, and \n With glittring gold, is cyted at the altar for to stand. \n There heeres he woordes (he wotes not what) the which the preest dooth pray, \n And on his forehead suffereth him betweene his homes to lay \n The eares of come that he himself hath wrought for in the clay, \n And stayneth with his blood the knyfe that he himself perchaunce \n Hathe in the water sheere ere then behild by soodein glaunce. \n Immediatly they haling out his hartstrings still alive, \n And poring on them, seeke therein Goddes secrets to retryve. \n Whence commes so greedy appetyte in men, of wicked meate? \n And dare yee, O yee mortall men, adventure thus to eate? \n Nay doo not (I beseeche yee) so. But give good eare and heede \n To that that I shall warne you of, and trust it as your creede, \n That whensoever you doo eate your Oxen, you devowre \n Your husbandmen. And forasmuch as God this instant howre \n Dooth move my toong to speake, I will obey his heavenly powre. \n My God Apollos temple I will set you open, and \n Disclose the woondrous heavens themselves, and make you understand \n The Oracles and secrets of the Godly majestye. \n Greate things, and such as wit of man could never yit espye, \n And such as have beene hidden long, I purpose to descrye. \n I mynd to leave the earth, and up among the starres to stye. \n I mynd to leave this grosser place, and in the clowdes to flye, \n And on stowt Atlas shoulders strong to rest my self on hye, \n And looking downe from heaven on men that wander heere and there \n In dreadfull feare of death as though they voyd of reason were, \n To give them exhortation thus: and playnely to unwynd \n The whole discourse of destinie as nature hath assignd. \n\n \n",

Howbee't, they leaving evermore \n Theyr former dwellings, are receyvd and live ageine in new. \n For I myself (ryght well in mynd I beare it to be trew) \n Was in the tyme of Trojan warre Euphorbus, Panthewes sonne, \n Quyght through whoose hart the deathfull speare of Menelay did ronne. \n I late ago in Junos Church at Argos did behold \n And knew the target which I in my left hand there did hold. \n Al things doo chaunge. But nothing sure dooth perrish. This same spright \n Dooth fleete, and fisking heere and there dooth swiftly take his flyght \n From one place to another place, and entreth every wyght, \n Removing out of man to beast, and out of beast to man. \n But yit it never perrisheth nor never perrish can. \n And even as supple wax with ease receyveth fygures straunge, \n And keepes not ay one shape, ne bydes assured ay from chaunge, \n And yit continueth alwayes wax in substaunce: so I say \n The soule is ay the selfsame thing it was and yit astray \n It fleeteth into sundry shapes. Therfore lest Godlynesse \n Bee vanquisht by outragious lust of belly beastlynesse, \n Forbeare (I speake by prophesie) your kinsfolkes ghostes to chace \n By slaughter: neyther nourish blood with blood in any cace. \n And sith on open sea the wynds doo blow my sayles apace, \n In all the world there is not that that standeth at a stay. \n Things eb and flow: and every shape is made to passe away. \n The tyme itself continually is fleeting like a brooke. \n For neyther brooke nor lyghtsomme tyme can tarrye still. But looke \n As every wave dryves other foorth, and that that commes behynd \n Bothe thrusteth and is thrust itself: even so the tymes by kynd \n Doo fly and follow bothe at once, and evermore renew. \n For that that was before is left, and streyght there dooth ensew \n Anoother that was never erst. Eche twincling of an eye \n Dooth chaunge. Wee see that after day commes nyght and darks the sky, \n And after nyght the lyghtsum Sunne succeedeth orderly. \n Like colour is not in the heaven when all things weery lye \n At midnyght sound asleepe, as when the daystarre cleere and bryght \n Commes foorth uppon his milkwhyght steede. Ageine in other plyght \n The Morning, Pallants daughter fayre, the messenger of lyght \n Delivereth into Phebus handes the world of cleerer hew. \n The circle also of the sonne what tyme it ryseth new \n And when it setteth, looketh red, but when it mounts most hye, \n Then lookes it whyght, bycause that there the nature of the skye \n Is better, and from filthye drosse of earth dooth further flye. \n The image also of the Moone that shyneth ay by nyght, \n Is never of one quantitie. For that that giveth lyght \n Today, is lesser than the next that followeth, till the full. \n And then contrarywyse eche day her lyght away dooth pull. \n What? Seest thou not how that the yeere as representing playne \n The age of man, departes itself in quarters fowre? First bayne \n And tender in the spring it is, even like a sucking babe. \n Then greene, and voyd of strength, and lush, and foggye, is the blade, \n And cheeres the husbandman with hope. Then all things florish gay. \n The earth with flowres of sundry hew then seemeth for to play, \n And vertue small or none to herbes there dooth as yit belong. \n The yeere from springtyde passing foorth to sommer, wexeth strong, \n Becommeth lyke a lusty youth. For in our lyfe through out \n There is no tyme more plentifull, more lusty, hote and stout. \n Then followeth Harvest when the heate of youth growes sumwhat cold, \n Rype, meeld, disposed meane betwixt a yoongman and an old, \n And sumwhat sprent with grayish heare. Then ugly winter last \n Like age steales on with trembling steppes, all bald, or overcast \n With shirle thinne heare as whyght as snowe. Our bodies also ay \n Doo alter still from tyme to tyme, and never stand at stay. \n Wee shall not bee the same wee were today or yisterday. \n The day hath beene wee were but seede and only hope of men, \n And in our moothers womb wee had our dwelling place as then: \n Dame Nature put to conning hand and suffred not that wee \n Within our moothers streyned womb should ay distressed bee, \n But brought us out to aire, and from our prison set us free. \n The chyld newborne lyes voyd of strength. Within a season tho \n He wexing fowerfooted lernes like savage beastes to go. \n Then sumwhat foltring, and as yit not firme of foote, he standes \n By getting sumwhat for to helpe his sinewes in his handes. \n From that tyme growing strong and swift, he passeth foorth the space \n Of youth: and also wearing out his middle age apace, \n Through drooping ages steepye path he ronneth out his race. \n This age dooth undermyne the strength of former yeares, and throwes \n It downe. Which thing old Milo by example playnely showes. \n For when he sawe those armes of his (which heeretofore had beene \n As strong as ever Hercules in woorking deadly teene \n Of biggest beastes) hang flapping downe, and nought but empty skin, \n He wept. And Helen when shee saw her aged wrincles in \n A glasse wept also: musing in herself what men had seene, \n That by two noble princes sonnes shee twyce had ravisht beene. \n Thou tyme the eater up of things, and age of spyghtfull teene, \n Destroy all things. And when that long continuance hath them bit, \n You leysurely by lingring death consume them every whit. \n And theis that wee call Elements doo never stand at stay. \n The enterchaunging course of them I will before yee lay. \n Give heede therto. This endlesse world conteynes therin I say \n Fowre substances of which all things are gendred. Of theis fower \n The Earth and Water for theyr masse and weyght are sunken lower. \n The other cowple Aire and Fyre, the purer of the twayne, \n Mount up, and nought can keepe them downe. And though there doo remayne \n A space betweene eche one of them: yit every thing is made \n Of themsame fowre, and into them at length ageine doo fade. \n The earth resolving leysurely dooth melt to water sheere. \n The water fyned turnes to aire. The aire eeke purged cleere \n From grossenesse, spyreth up aloft, and there becommeth fyre. \n From thence in order contrary they backe ageine retyre. \n Fyre thickening passeth into Aire, and Ayer wexing grosse, \n Returnes to water: Water eeke congealing into drosse, \n Becommeth earth. \n\n \n",

And though that varyably \n Things passe perchaunce from place to place: yit all from whence they came \n Returning, do unperrisshed continew still the same. \n But as for in one shape, bee sure that nothing long can last. \n Even so the ages of the world from gold to Iron past. \n Even so have places oftentymes exchaunged theyr estate. \n For I have seene it sea which was substanciall ground alate, \n Ageine where sea was, I have seene the same become dry lond, \n And shelles and scales of Seafish farre have lyen from any strond, \n And in the toppes of mountaynes hygh old Anchors have beene found. \n Deepe valleyes have by watershotte beene made of levell ground, \n And hilles by force of gulling oft have into sea beene worne. \n Hard gravell ground is sumtyme seene where marris was beforne, \n And that that erst did suffer drowght, becommeth standing lakes. \n Heere nature sendeth new springs out, and there the old in takes. \n Full many rivers in the world through earthquakes heretofore \n Have eyther chaundgd theyr former course, or dryde and ronne no more. \n Soo Lycus beeing swallowed up by gaping of the ground, \n A greatway off fro thence is in another channell found. \n Even so the river Erasine among the feeldes of Arge \n Sinkes one whyle, and another whyle ronnes greate ageine at large. \n Caycus also of the land of Mysia (as men say) \n Misliking of his former head, ronnes now another way. \n In Sicill also Amasene ronnes sumtyme full and hye, \n And sumtyme stopping up his spring, he makes his chanell drye. \n Men drank the waters of the brooke Anigrus heretofore, \n Which now is such that men abhorre to towche them any more. \n Which commes to passe, (onlesse wee will discredit Poets quyght) \n Bycause the Centaures vanquisshed by Hercules in fyght \n Did wash theyr woundes in that same brooke. But dooth not Hypanis \n That springeth in the Scythian hilles, which at his fountaine is \n Ryght pleasant, afterward becomme of brackish bitter taste? \n Antissa , and Phenycian Tyre, and Pharos in tyme past \n Were compast all about with waves: but none of all theis three \n Is now an Ile. Ageine the towne of Lewcas once was free \n From sea, and in the auncient tyme was joyned to the land. \n But now environd round about with water it dooth stand. \n Men say that Sicill also hath beene joynd to Italy \n Untill the sea consumde the bounds beetweene, and did supply \n The roome with water. If yee go to seeke for Helicee \n And Burye which were Cities of Achaia , you shall see \n Them hidden under water, and the shipmen yit doo showe \n The walles and steeples of the townes drownd under as they rowe. \n Not farre from Pitthey Troyzen is a certeine high ground found \n All voyd of trees, which heeretofore was playne and levell ground, \n But now a mountayne. For the wyndes (a woondrous thing to say) \n Inclosed in the hollow caves of ground, and seeking way \n To passe therefro, in struggling long to get the open skye \n In vayne, (bycause in all the cave there was no vent wherby \n To issue out,) did stretch the ground and make it swell on hye, \n As dooth a bladder that is blowen by mouth, or as the skinne \n Of horned Goate in bottlewyse when wynd is gotten in. \n The swelling of the foresayd place remaynes at this day still, \n And by continuance waxing hard is growen a pretye hill. \n Of many things that come to mynd by heersay, and by skill \n Of good experience, I a fewe will utter to you mo. \n What? Dooth not water in his shapes chaunge straungely to and fro? \n The well of horned Hammon is at noonetyde passing cold. \n At morne and even it wexeth warme. At midnyght none can hold \n His hand therin for passing heate. The well of Athamane, \n Is sayd to kindle woode what tyme the moone is in the wane. \n The Cicons have a certeine streame which beeing droonk dooth bring \n Mennes bowwelles into Marble hard: and whatsoever thing \n Is towcht therwith, it turnes to stone. And by your bounds behold \n The rivers Crathe and Sybaris make yellow heare like gold \n And Amber. There are also springs (which thing is farre more straunge) \n Which not the bodye only, but the mynd doo also chaunge. \n Whoo hath not heard of Salmacis, that fowle and filthye sink? \n Or of the lake of Aethyop, which if a man doo drink, \n He eyther ronneth mad, or else with woondrous drowzinesse \n Forgoeth quyght his memorie? Whoo ever dooth represse \n His thirst with drawght of Clitor well, hates wyne, and dooth delyght \n In only water: eyther for bycause there is a myght \n Contrary unto warming wyne by nature in the well, \n Or else bycause (for so the folk of Arcadye doo tell) \n Melampus, Amythaons sonne (when he delivered had \n King Praetus daughters by his charmes and herbes from being mad), \n Cast into that same water all the baggage wherewithall \n He purdgd the madnesse of theyr mynds. And so it did befall, \n That lothsomnesse of wyne did in those waters ay remayne. \n Ageine in Lyncest contrarie effect to this dooth reigne. \n For whoo so drinkes too much therof, he reeleth heere and there \n As if by quaffing wyne no whyt alayd he droonken were. \n There is a Lake in Arcadye which Pheney men did name \n In auncient tyme, whoose dowtfulnesse deserveth justly blame. \n A nyght tymes take thou heede of it, for if thou taste the same \n A nyghttymes, it will hurt.

And yit a further feate, \n Go kill an Ox and burye him, (the thing by proof man sees) \n And of his rotten flesh will breede the flowergathering Bees, \n Which as theyr father did before, love feeldes exceedingly, \n And unto woork in hope of gayne theyr busye limbes apply. \n The Hornet is engendred of a lustye buryed Steede. \n Go pull away the cleas from Crabbes that in the sea doo breede, \n And burye all the rest in mowld, and of the same will spring \n A Scorpion which with writhen tayle will threaten for to sting. \n The Caterpillers of the feelde the which are woont to weave \n Hore filmes uppon the leaves of trees, theyr former nature leave, \n (Which thing is knowen to husbandmen) and turne to Butterflyes. \n The mud hath in it certeine seede wherof greene frosshes ryse. \n And first it brings them footelesse foorth.

He (assoone as age dooth strength him give \n To beare the burthen) from the tree the weyghty nest dooth lift, \n And godlyly his cradle thence and fathers herce dooth shift. \n And flying through the suttle aire he gettes to Phebus towne, \n And there before the temple doore dooth lay his burthen downe. \n But if that any noveltye woorth woondring bee in theis, \n Much rather may we woonder at the Hyen if we please. \n To see how interchaungeably it one whyle dooth remayne \n A female, and another whyle becommeth male againe. \n The creature also which dooth live by only aire and wynd, \n All colours that it leaneth to dooth counterfet by kynd. \n The Grapegod Bacchus, when he had subdewd the land of Inde , \n Did fynd a spotted beast cald Lynx, whoose urine (by report) \n By towching of the open aire congealeth in such sort, \n As that it dooth becomme a stone.

Moreover I foresee, \n A Citie by the offspring of the Trojans buylt shall bee, \n So great as never in the world the lyke was seene before \n Nor is this present, neyther shall be seene for evermore. \n A number of most noble peeres for manye yeeres afore \n Shall make it strong and puyssant: but hee that shall it make \n The sovereine Ladye of the world, by ryght descent shall take \n His first beginning from thy sonne the little Jule. And when \n The earth hathe had her tyme of him, the sky and welkin then \n Shall have him up for evermore, and heaven shall bee his end.\n\n \n",

And lastly in the end \n He shall to heaven among the starres, his auncetors, ascend, \n But not before his lyfe by length to drooping age doo tend. \n And therfore from the murthred corce of Julius Caesar take \n His sowle with speede, and of the same a burning cresset make, \n That from our heavenly pallace he may evermore looke downe \n Uppon our royall Capitoll and Court within Rome towne. \n He scarcely ended had theis woordes, but Venus out of hand \n Amid the Senate house of Rome invisible did stand, \n And from her Caesars bodye tooke his new expulsed spryght \n The which shee not permitting to resolve to ayer quyght, \n Did place it in the skye among the starres that glister bryght \n And as shee bare it, shee did feele it gather heavenly myght, \n And for to wexen fyrye. Shee no sooner let it flye, \n But that a goodly shyning starre it up aloft did stye \n And drew a greate way after it bryght beames like burning heare. \n Whoo looking on his sonnes good deedes confessed that they were \n Farre greater than his owne, and glad he was to see that hee \n Excelled him. Although his sonne in no wyse would agree \n To have his deedes preferd before his fathers: yit dooth fame, \n (Whoo ay is free, and bound to no commaund) withstand the same \n And stryving in that one behalf ageinst his hest and will, \n Proceedeth to preferre his deedes before his fathers still. \n Even so to Agamemnons great renowne gives Atreus place, \n Even so Achilles deedes, the deedes of Peleus doo abace. \n Even so beyond Aegaeus, farre dooth Theseyes prowesse go. \n And (that I may examples use full matching theis) even so \n Is Saturne lesse in fame than Jove. Jove rules the heavenly spheres, \n And all the tryple shaped world. And our Augustus beares \n Dominion over all the earth. They bothe are fathers: they \n Are rulers both. Yee Goddes to whom both fyre and swoord gave way, \n What tyme yee with Aenaeas came from Troy : yee Goddes that were \n Of mortall men canonyzed: thou Quirin whoo didst reere \n The walles of Rome : and Mars who wart the valeant Quirins syre \n And Vesta of the household Goddes of Caesar with thy fyre \n Most holy: and thou Phebus whoo with Vesta also art \n Of household: and thou Jupiter whoo in the hyghest part \n Of mountayne Tarpey hast thy Church: and all yee Goddes that may \n With conscience sauf by Poets bee appealed to: I pray \n Let that same day bee slowe to comme and after I am dead, \n In which Augustus (whoo as now of all the world is head) \n Quyght giving up the care therof ascend to heaven for ay, \n There (absent hence) to favour such as unto him shall pray. \n Now have I brought a woork to end which neither Joves feerce wrath, \n Nor swoord, nor fyre, nor freating age with all the force it hath \n Are able to abolish quyght. Let comme that fatall howre \n Which (saving of this brittle flesh) hath over mee no powre, \n And at his pleasure make an end of myne uncerteyne tyme. \n Yit shall the better part of mee assured bee to clyme \n Aloft above the starry skye. And all the world shall never \n Be able for to quench my name. For looke how farre so ever \n The Romane Empyre by the ryght of conquest shall extend, \n So farre shall all folke reade this woork. And tyme without all end \n (If Poets as by prophesie about the truth may ame) \n My lyfe shall everlastingly bee lengthened still by fame. \n"
