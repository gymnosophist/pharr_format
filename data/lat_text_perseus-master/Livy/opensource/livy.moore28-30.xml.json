The foremost matrons in the state, among whom the name of one in particular, that of Claudia Quinta, is conspicuous, received her. Claudia's repute, previously not unquestioned, as tradition reports it, has made her purity the more celebrated among posterity by a service so\n\t\t\t\t\t devout. The matrons passed the goddess from hand to hand in an unbroken succession to each other, while the entire city poured out to meet her. Censers had been placed before the doors along the route of the bearers, and kindling their incense, people prayed that gracious and benignant she might enter the city of Rome. It was to the Temple of Victory, which is on the Palatine, that they carried the goddess on the day before the Ides of April, and that was a holy\n\t\t\t\t\t day.

Hasdrubal hastened to Carthage, that no weak action might be taken in the fear induced by the recent disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t At first the news brought such alarm to the city that they believed Scipio would leave Utica to itself and forthwith besiege Carthage.\n\t\t\t\t\t The senate was accordingly convened by the  whose authority corresponded to that of consuls. There it was a conflict between three proposals:\n\t\t\t\t\t one favoured peace envoys to Scipio; the second was for recalling Hannibal to defend their city from a war which meant destruction; the third showed a Roman steadfastness in adversity. This proposal was that they should repair the losses to the army and urge Syphax not to give up the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t This motion was carried because Hasdrubal in person and all of the Barcine party supported the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t Then they began to conduct a levy in the city and in the country, and emissaries were sent to Syphax, who on his part also was making every effort to renew the war, since his wife had influenced him no longer, as before, by caresses, effectual enough for the temper of a lover but\n\t\t\t\t\t by prayers and moving entreaty, imploring him, as her eyes filled with tears, not to betray her father and her city and allow Carthage to be destroyed by the same flames with which the camps had been consumed.\n\t\t\t\t\t Hope also at the right moment was brought by the emissaries in the news that four thousand Celtiberians, the flower of their youth, had met them near a city named Obba, having been hired in Spain by their own recruiting-officers; and Hasdrubal, they said, would soon arrive with a force by no means to be despised.\n\t\t\t\t\t In consequence he not only gave a favourable answer to the legates but also showed them a large number of Numidian rustics to whom he had just been furnishing arms and horses, and assured them that he would call out all the young men from his kingdom.\n\t\t\t\t\t He was aware, he said, that the disaster had been due to fire, not to battle; that a war is lost only by the man who is defeated in battle.\n\t\t\t\t\t Such was his answer to the legates, and after a few days Hasdrubal and Syphax again united their forces.

Nor was it a bloodless victory for the Romans.
