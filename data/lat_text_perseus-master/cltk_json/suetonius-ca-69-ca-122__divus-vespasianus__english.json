        "0":"\n\t\t\t\t THE empire, which had been long thrown into a disturbed and unsettled state, by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe rebellion and violent death of its three last rulers, was at length restored\n\t\t\t\t\tto peace and security by the Flavian family, whose descent was indeed obscure,\n\t\t\t\t\tand which boasted no ancestral honours; but the public had no cause to regret\n\t\t\t\t\tits elevation; though it is acknowledged that Domitian met with the just reward\n\t\t\t\t\tof his avarice and cruelty. Titus Flavius Petro, a townsman of Reate , whether a centurion or an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t evocatus of Pompey's party in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe civil war, is uncertain, fled out of the battle of Pharsalia and went home;\n\t\t\t\t\twhere, having at last obtained his pardon and discharge, he became a collector\n\t\t\t\t\tof the money raised by public sales in the way of auction. His son, surnamed\n\t\t\t\t\tSabinus, was never engaged in the military service, though some say he was a\n\t\t\t\t\tcenturion of the first order, and others, that whilst he held that rank, he was\n\t\t\t\t\tdischarged on account of his bad state of health: this Sabinus, I say, was a\n\t\t\t\t\trepublican, and received the tax of the fortieth penny in Asia . And there were remaining, at the time of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe advancement of the family, several statues, which had been erected to him by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cities of that province, with this inscription: \"To the honest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTax-farmer.\" He afterwards\n\t\t\t\t\tturned usurer amongst the Helvetii, and there died, leaving behind him his wife,\n\t\t\t\t\tVespasia Polla , and two sons by her;\n\t\t\t\t\tthe elder of whom, Sabinus, came to be prefect of the city, and the younger,\n\t\t\t\t\tVespasian, to be emperor. Polla, descended of a good family, at Nursia , had for her\n\t\t\t\t\tfather Vespasius Pollio, thrice appointed military tribune, and at last prefect\n\t\t\t\t\tof the camp; and her brother was a senator of praetorian dignity. There is to\n\t\t\t\t\tthis day, about six miles from Nursia , on the road to Spoletum, a place on the summit of a\n\t\t\t\t\thill, called Vespasize, where are several monuments of the Vespasii, a\n\t\t\t\t\tsufficient proof of the splendour and antiquity of the family. I will not deny\n\t\t\t\t\tthat some have pretended to say. that Petro's father was a native of Gallia\n\t\t\t\t\tTranspadana, whose employment was to hire work-people\n\t\t\t\t\twho used to emigrate every year from the country of the Umbria into that of the Sabines, to assist\n\t\t\t\t\tthem in their husbandry; but who settled at last in the\n\t\t\t\t\ttown of Reate , and there married. But\n\t\t\t\t\tof this I have not been able to discover the least proof, upon the strictest\n\t\t\t\t\tinquiry. \n\t\t\t",
        "1":"\n\t\t\t\t Vespasian was born in the country of the Sabines, between the Reate , and a little country-seat called\n\t\t\t\t\tPhalacrine, upon the fifth of the calends of December [27th November], in the\n\t\t\t\t\tevening, in the consulship of Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus and Caius Poppaeus\n\t\t\t\t\tSabinus, five years before the death of Augustus; and was educated under the care\n\t\t\t\t\tof Tertulla, his grandmother by the father's side, upon an estate belonging to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe family, at Cosa . After his advancement to the empire, he used\n\t\t\t\t\tfrequently to visit the place where he had spent his infancy; and the villa was\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinued in the same condition, that he might see every thing about him just as\n\t\t\t\t\the had been used to do. And he had so great a regard for the memory of his\n\t\t\t\t\tgrandmother, that, upon solemn occasions and festival days, he constantly drank\n\t\t\t\t\tout of a silver cup which she had been accustomed to use. After assuming the\n\t\t\t\t\tmanly habit, he had a long time a distaste for the senatorian toga, though his\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother had obtained it- nor could he be persuaded by any one but his mother to\n\t\t\t\t\tsue for that badge of honour. She at length drove him to it, more by taunts and\n\t\t\t\t\treproaches, than by entreaties and authority, calling him now and then, by way\n\t\t\t\t\tof reproach, his brother's footman. He served as military tribune in Thrace . When made quaestor, the province of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Crete and Cyrene fell to him by lot. He was candidate\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the aedileship, and soon after for the praetorship, but met with a repulse\n\t\t\t\t\tin the former case; though at last, with much difficulty, he came in sixth on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe poll-books. But the office of praetor he carried upon his first canvass,\n\t\t\t\t\tstanding amongst the highest at the poll. Being incensed against the senate, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdesirous to gain, by all possible means, the good graces of Caius, he obtained leave to exhibit extraordinary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t games for the emperor's\n\t\t\t\t\tvictory in Germany , and advised them to\n\t\t\t\t\tincrease the punishment of the conspirators against his life, by exposing their\n\t\t\t\t\tcorpses unburied. He likewise gave him thanks in that august assembly for the\n\t\t\t\t\thonour of being admitted to his table. \n\t\t\t",
        "2":"\n\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, he married Flavia Domitilla, who had formerly been the mistress of\n\t\t\t\t\tStatilius Capella, a Roman knight of Sabrata in Africa , who\n\t\t\t\t\t[Domitilla] enjoyed Latin rights; and was soon after declared fully and freely a\n\t\t\t\t\tcitizen of Rome , on a trial before the\n\t\t\t\t\tcourt of Recovery, brought by her father Flavius Liberalis, a native of\n\t\t\t\t\tFerentum, but no more than secretary to a quaestor. By her he had the following\n\t\t\t\t\tchildren: Titus, Domitia nd Domitilla. He outlived his wife and daughter, and\n\t\t\t\t\tlost them both before he became emperor. After the death of his wife he renewed\n\t\t\t\t\this union with his former\n\t\t\t\t\tconcubine, Caenis, the freedwoman of Antonia, and also her amanuensis, and\n\t\t\t\t\ttreated her, even after he was emperor, almost as if she had been his lawful\n\t\t\t\t\t\twife. \n\t\t\t",
        "3":"\n\t\t\t\t In the reign of Claudius, by the interest of Narcissus, he was sent to Germany , in command of a legion; whence being\n\t\t\t\t\tremoved into Britain , he engaged the\n\t\t\t\t\tenemy in thirty several battles. He reduced under subjection to the Romans two\n\t\t\t\t\tvery powerful tribes, and above twenty great towns, with the Isle of Wight,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich lies close to the coast of Britain ; partly under the command of Aulus Plautius, the\n\t\t\t\t\tconsular lieutenant, and partly under Claudius himself. For this success he received the triumphal ornaments, and in a short\n\t\t\t\t\ttime after two priesthoods, besides the consulship, which he held during the\n\t\t\t\t\tlast two months of the year. The interval\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween that and his proconsulship he spent in leisure and retirement, for fear\n\t\t\t\t\tof Agrippina, who still held great sway over her son, and hated all the friends\n\t\t\t\t\tof Narcissus, who was then dead. Afterwards he got by lot the province of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Africa , which he governed with\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat reputation, excepting that once, in an insurrection at Adrumetum, he.was\n\t\t\t\t\tpelted with turnips. It is certain that he returned thence nothing richer; for\n\t\t\t\t\this credit was so low, that he was obliged to mortgage his whole property to his\n\t\t\t\t\tbrother, and was reduced to the necessity of dealing in mules, for the support\n\t\t\t\t\tof his rank; for which reason he was commonly called \"the Muleteer.\" He is said\n\t\t\t\t\tlikewise to have been convicted of extorting from a young man of fashion two\n\t\t\t\t\thundred thousand sesterces for procuring him the broad-stripe, contrary to the\n\t\t\t\t\twishes of his father, and was severely reprimanded for it. While in attendance\n\t\t\t\t\tupon Nero in Achaia , he frequently\n\t\t\t\t\twithdrew from the theatre while Nero was singing, and went to' sleep if he\n\t\t\t\t\tremained, which gave so much offence, that he was not only excluded from his\n\t\t\t\t\tsociety, but debarred the liberty of saluting him in public. Upon this, he\n\t\t\t\t\tretired to a small out-of-the-way town, where he lay skulking in constant fear\n\t\t\t\t\tof his life, until a province, with an army, was offered him. \n\t\t\t\t A firm persuasion had long prevailed through all the East, that it was fated for the empire of the world, at that time,\n\t\t\t\t\tto devolve on some one who should go forth from Judaea . This prediction referred to a Roman emperor, as the\n\t\t\t\t\tevent shewed; but the Jews, applying it to themselves, broke out into rebellion,\n\t\t\t\t\tand having defeated and slain their governor, routed the lieutenant of Syria , a man of consular rank, who was advancing to his assistance, and took an\n\t\t\t\t\teagle, the standard of one of his legions. As the suppression of this revolt\n\t\t\t\t\tappeared to require a stronger force and an active general, who might be safely\n\t\t\t\t\ttrusted in an affair of so much importance, Vespasian was chosen in preference\n\t\t\t\t\tto all others, both for his own activity, and on account of the obscurity of his\n\t\t\t\t\torigin and name, being a person of whom there could be not the least jealousy.\n\t\t\t\t\tTwo legions, 'therefore, eight squadrons of horse, and ten cohorts, being added\n\t\t\t\t\tto the former troops in Judaea , and,\n\t\t\t\t\ttaking with him his eldest son as lieutenant, as soon as he arrived in his\n\t\t\t\t\tprovince, he turned the eyes of the neighbouring provinces upon him, by\n\t\t\t\t\treforming immediately the discipline of the camp, and engaging the enemy once or\n\t\t\t\t\ttwice with such resolution, that, in the attack of a castle, he had his knee hurt by the\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke of a stone, and received several arrows in his shield. \n\t\t\t",
        "4":"\n\t\t\t\t After the deaths of Nero and Galba, whilst Otho and Vitellius were contending for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sovereignty, he entertained hopes of obtaining the empire, with the prospect\n\t\t\t\t\tof which he had long before flattered himself, from the following omens. Upon an\n\t\t\t\t\testate belonging to the Flavian family, in the neighbourhood of Rome , there was an old oak, sacred to Mars,\n\t\t\t\t\twhich, at the three several deliveries of Vespasia, put out each time a new\n\t\t\t\t\tbranch; evident intimations of the future fortune of each child. The first was\n\t\t\t\t\tbut a slender one, which quickly withered away; and accordingly, the girl that\n\t\t\t\t\twas born did not live long. The second became vigorous, which portended great\n\t\t\t\t\tgood fortune; but the third grew like a tree. His father Sabinus, encouraged by\n\t\t\t\t\tthese omens, which were confirmed by the augurs, told his mother, \"that her\n\t\t\t\t\tgrandson would be emperor of Rome ;\" at\n\t\t\t\t\twhich she laughed heartily, wondering, she said, \"that her son should be in his\n\t\t\t\t\tdotage whilst she continued still in full possession of her faculties.\" \n\t\t\t\t Afterwards in his aedileship, when Caius Caesar, being enraged at his not taking\n\t\t\t\t\tcare to have the streets kept clean, ordered the soldiers to fill the bosom of\n\t\t\t\t\this gown with dirt, some persons at that time construed it into a sign that the\n\t\t\t\t\tgovernment, being trampled under foot and deserted in some civil commotion,\n\t\t\t\t\twould fall under his protection, and as it were into his lap. Once, while he was\n\t\t\t\t\tat dinner, a strange dog that wandered about the streets, brought a man's\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand, and laid it under the table. And another time, while he was\n\t\t\t\t\tat supper, a plough-ox throwing the yoke off his neck, broke into the room, and\n\t\t\t\t\tafter he had frightened away all the attendants, on a suddren, as if he was\n\t\t\t\t\ttired, fell down at his feet, as he lay still upon his couch, and hung down his\n\t\t\t\t\tneck. A cypress-tree likewise, in a field belonging to the family, was torn up\n\t\t\t\t\tby the roots, and laid flat upon the ground, when there was no violent wind; but\n\t\t\t\t\tnext day it rose again fresher and stronger than before. \n\t\t\t\t He dreamt in Achaia that the good\n\t\t\t\t\tfortune of himself and his family would begin when Nero had a tooth drawn; and\n\t\t\t\t\tit happened that the day after, a surgeon coming into the hall, showed him a\n\t\t\t\t\ttooth which he had just extracted from Nero. In Judea , upon his consulting the oracle of the divinity at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Carmel , the answer\n\t\t\t\t\twas so encouraging as to assure him of success in anything he projected, however\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat or important it might be. And when Josephus, one of the noble prisoners, was put in\n\t\t\t\t\tchains, he confidently affirmed that he should be released in a very short time\n\t\t\t\t\tby the same Vespasian, but he would be emperor first. Some\n\t\t\t\t\tomens were likewise mentioned in the news from Rome , and among others, that Nero, towards the close of his\n\t\t\t\t\tdays, was commanded in a dream to carry Jupiter's sacred chariot out of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsanctuary where it stood, to Vespasian's house, and conduct it thence into the\n\t\t\t\t\tcircus. Also not long afterwards, as Galba was going to the election in which he\n\t\t\t\t\twas created consul for the second time, a statue of the Divine Julius turned towards the east. And in the field\n\t\t\t\t\tof Bedriacum, before the battle\n\t\t\t\t\tbegan, two eagles engaged in the sight of the army; and one of them being\n\t\t\t\t\tbeaten, a third came from the east, and drove away the conqueror. \n\t\t\t",
        "5":"\n\t\t\t\t He made, however, no attempt upon the sovereignty though his friends were very\n\t\t\t\t\tready to support him, and even pressed him to the enterprise untl he was\n\t\t\t\t\tencouraged to it by the fortuitous aid of persons unknown to him and at a\n\t\t\t\t\tdistance. Two thousand men, drawn out of three legions in the Moesian army, had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen sent to the assistance of Otho. While they were upon their march, news came\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he had been defeated, and had put an end to his life; notwithstanding which\n\t\t\t\t\tthey continued their march as far as Aquileia , pretending that they gave no credit to the report.\n\t\t\t\t\tThere, tempted by the opportunity which the disorder of the times afforded them,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey ravaged and plundered the country at discretion; until at length, fearing\n\t\t\t\t\tto be called to an account on their return, and punished for it, they resolved\n\t\t\t\t\tupon choosing and creating an emperor. \"For they were no ways inferior,\" they\n\t\t\t\t\tsaid, \"to the army which made Galba emperor, nor to the praetorian troops which\n\t\t\t\t\thad set up Otho, nor the army in Germany , to whom Vitellius owed his elevation.\" The names of\n\t\t\t\t\tall the consular lieutenants, therefore, being taken into consideration, and one\n\t\t\t\t\tobjecting to one, and another to another, for various reasons; at last some of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe third legion, which a little before Nero's death had been removed out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Syria into Moesia , extolled Vespasian in high terms; and\n\t\t\t\t\tall the rest assenting, his name was immediately inscribed on their standards.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe design was nevertheless quashed for a time, the troops being brought to\n\t\t\t\t\tsubmit to Vitellius a little longer. \n\t\t\t\t However, the fact becoming known, Tiberius Alexander, governor of Egypt , first obliged the legions under his\n\t\t\t\t\tcommand to swear obedience to Vespasian as their emperor, on the calends [the\n\t\t\t\t\t1st] of July, which was observed ever after as the day of his accession to the\n\t\t\t\t\tempire; and upon the fifth of the ides of the same month [the 28th of July], the\n\t\t\t\t\tarmy in Judaea , where he then was, also\n\t\t\t\t\tswore allegiance to him. What contributed greatly to forward the affair, was a\n\t\t\t\t\tcopy of a letter, whether real or counterfeit, which was circulated, and said to\n\t\t\t\t\thave been written by Otho before his decease to Vespasian, recommending to him\n\t\t\t\t\tin the most urgent terms to avenge his death, and entreating him to come to the\n\t\t\t\t\taid of the commonwealth; as well as a report which was circulated, that\n\t\t\t\t\tVitellius, after his success against Otho, proposed to change the winter\n\t\t\t\t\tquarters of the legions, and remove those in Germany to a less hazardous station and a warmer climate.\n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, amongst the governors of provinces, Lucinius Mucianus dropping the\n\t\t\t\t\tgrudge arising from a jealousy of which he had hitherto made no secret, promised\n\t\t\t\t\tto join him with the Syrian army, and, among the allied kings, Vologesus, king\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Parthians, offered him a reinforcement of forty thousand archers. \n\t\t\t",
        "6":"\n\t\t\t\t Having, therefore, entered on a civil war, and sent forward his generals and\n\t\t\t\t\tforces into Italy , he himself, in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmeantime, passed over to Alexandria , to obtain possession of the key of Egypt . Here having entered\n\t\t\t\t\talone, without attendants, the temple of Serapis, to take the auspices\n\t\t\t\t\trespecting the establishment of his power, and having done his utmost to\n\t\t\t\t\tpropitiate the deity, upon turning round, [his freedman] Basilides appeared before him, and seemed to offer him the sacred\n\t\t\t\t\tleaves, chaplets, and cakes, according to the usage of the place, although no\n\t\t\t\t\tone had admitted him, and he had long laboured under a muscular debility, which\n\t\t\t\t\twould hardly have allowed him to walk into the temple; besides which, it was\n\t\t\t\t\tcertain that at the very time he was far away. Immeiately after this, arrived\n\t\t\t\t\tletters with intelligence that Vitellius's troops had been defeated at Cremona,\n\t\t\t\t\tand he himself slain at Rome. Vespasian, the new emperor, having been raised\n\t\t\t\t\tunexpectedly from a low estate, wanted something which might clothe him with\n\t\t\t\t\tdivine majesty and authority. This, likewise, was now added. A poor man who was\n\t\t\t\t\tblind, and another who was lame, came both together before him, when he was\n\t\t\t\t\tseated on the tribunal, imploring him to heal them, and saying that they were\n\t\t\t\t\tadmonished in a dream by the god Serapis to seek his aid, who assured them that\n\t\t\t\t\the would restore sight to the one by anointing his eyes with his spittle, and\n\t\t\t\t\tgive strength to the leg of the other, if he vouchsafed but to touch it with his\n\t\t\t\t\theel. At first he could scarcely believe that the thing would any how succeed,\n\t\t\t\t\tand therefore hesitated to venture on making the experiment. At length, however,\n\t\t\t\t\tby the advice of his friends, he made the attempt publicly, in the presence of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe assembled multitudes, and it was crowned with success in both cases. About the same time,\n\t\t\t\t\tat Tegea in Arcadia, by the direction of some soothsayers, several vessels of\n\t\t\t\t\tancient workmanship were dug out of a consecrated place, on which there was an\n\t\t\t\t\teffigy resembling Vespasian. \n\t\t\t",
        "7":"\n\t\t\t\t Returning now to Rome, under these auspices, and with a great reputation, after\n\t\t\t\t\tenjoying a triumph for victories over the Jews, he added eight consulships to his\n\t\t\t\t\tformer one. He likewise assumed the censorship, and made it his principal\n\t\t\t\t\tconcern, during the whole of his government, first to restore order in the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate, which had been almost ruined, and was in a tottering condition, and then\n\t\t\t\t\tto improve it. The soldiers, one part of them emboldened by victory, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tother smarting with the disgrace of their defeat, had abandoned themselves to\n\t\t\t\t\tevery species of licentiousness and insolence. Nay, the provinces, too, and free\n\t\t\t\t\tcities, and some kingdoms in alliance with Rome, were all in a disturbed state.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe, therefore, disbanded many of Vitellius's soldiers, and punished others; and\n\t\t\t\t\tso far was he from granting any extraordinary favours to the sharers of his\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccess, that it was late before he paid the gratuities due to them by law. That\n\t\t\t\t\the might let slip no opportunity of reforming the discipline of the army, upon a\n\t\t\t\t\tyoung man's coming much perfumed to return him thanks for having appointed him\n\t\t\t\t\tto command a squadron of horse, he turned away his head in disgust, and giving\n\t\t\t\t\thim this sharp reprimand, \"I had rather you had smelt of garlic,\" revoked his\n\t\t\t\t\tcommission. When the men belonging to the fleet, who travelled by turns from\n\t\t\t\t\tOstia and Puteoli to Rome, petitioned for an addition to their pay, under the\n\t\t\t\t\tname of shoe-money, thinking that it would answer little purpose to send them\n\t\t\t\t\taway without a reply, he ordered them for the future to run bare-footed; and so\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have done ever since. He deprived of their liberties, Achaia, Lycia,\n\t\t\t\t\tRhodes, Byzantium, and Samos, and reduced them into the form of provinces;\n\t\t\t\t\tThrace, also, and Cilicia, as well as Comagene, which until that time had been\n\t\t\t\t\tunder the government of kings. He stationed some legions in Cappadocia on\n\t\t\t\t\taccount of the frequent inroads of barbarians, and, instead of a Roman knight,\n\t\t\t\t\tappointed as governor of it a man of consular rank. The ruins of houses which\n\t\t\t\t\thad been burnt down long before, being a great desight to the city, he gave\n\t\t\t\t\tleave to any one who would, to take possession of the void ground and build upon\n\t\t\t\t\tit, if the proprietors should hesitate to perform the work themselves. He\n\t\t\t\t\tresolved upon rebuilding the Capitol, and was the foremost to put his hand to\n\t\t\t\t\tclearing the ground of the rubbish, and removed some of it upon his own\n\t\t\t\t\tshoulder. And he undertook, likewise, to restore the three thousand tables of\n\t\t\t\t\tbrass which had been destroyed in the fire which consumed the Capitol; searching\n\t\t\t\t\tin all quarters for copies of those curious and ancient records, in which were\n\t\t\t\t\tcontained the decrees of the senate, almost from the building of the city, as\n\t\t\t\t\twell as the acts of the people, relative to alliances, treaties, and privileges\n\t\t\t\t\tgranted to any person. \n\t\t\t",
        "8":"\n\t\t\t\t He likewise erected several new public buildings, namely the temple of Peace near the forum, that of\n\t\t\t\t\tClaudius on the Coelian mount, which had been begun by Agrippina, but almost\n\t\t\t\t\tentirely demolished by Nero; and an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamphitheatre \n\t\t\t\t\tin the middle of the city, upon finding that Augustus had projected such a work.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe purified the senatorian and equestrian orders, which had been much reduced by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe havoc made amongst them at several times, and was fallen into disrepute by\n\t\t\t\t\tneglect. Having expelled the most unworthy, he chose in their room the most\n\t\t\t\t\thonourable persons in Italy and the provinces. And to let it be known that those\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo orders differed not so much in privileges as in dignity, he declared\n\t\t\t\t\tpublicly when some altercation passed between a senator and a Roman knight,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"that senators ought not to be treated with scurrilous language, unless they\n\t\t\t\t\twere aggressors, and then it was fair and lawful to return it.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "9":"\n\t\t\t\t The business of the courts had prodigiously accumulted, partly from old law-suits\n\t\t\t\t\twhich, on account of the interruption that had been given to the course of\n\t\t\t\t\tjustice, still remained undecided, and partly from the accession of new suits\n\t\t\t\t\tarising out of the disorder of the times. He, therefore, chose cmmissioners by\n\t\t\t\t\tlot to provide for the restitution of what had been seized by violence during\n\t\t\t\t\tthe war, and others with extraordinary jurisdiction to decide causes belonging\n\t\t\t\t\tto the centumviri, and reduce them to as small a number as possible, for the\n\t\t\t\t\tdispatch of which, otherwise, the lives of the litigants could scarcely allow\n\t\t\t\t\tsufficient time. \n\t\t\t",
        "10":"\n\t\t\t\t Lust and luxury, from the licence which had long prevailed, had also grown to an\n\t\t\t\t\tenormous height. He, therefore, obtained a decree of the senate, that a woman\n\t\t\t\t\twho formed an union with the slave of another person, should be considered a\n\t\t\t\t\tbondwoman herself; and that usurers should not be allowed to take proceedings at\n\t\t\t\t\tlaw for the recovery of money lent to young men whilst they lived in their\n\t\t\t\t\tfather's family, not even after their fathers were dead. \n\t\t\t",
        "11":"\n\t\t\t\t In other affairs, from the beginning to the end of his government, he conduct\n\t\t\t\t\thimself-wihgreatmedeation and clemency. He was so far from disseriibling the\n\t\t\t\t\tobscurity of his extraction, that he frequently made mention of it himself. When\n\t\t\t\t\tsome affected to trace his pedigree to the founders of Reate, and a companion of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHercules, whose\n\t\t\t\t\tmonument is still to be seen on the Salarian road, he laughed at them for it.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd he was so little fond of external and adventitious ornaments, that, on the\n\t\t\t\t\tday of his triumph,' being quite tired of the length and tediousness of the\n\t\t\t\t\tprocession, he could not forbear saying, \"he was rightly served, for having in\n\t\t\t\t\this old age. been so silly as to desire a triumph; as if it was either due to\n\t\t\t\t\this ancestors, or had ever been expected by himself.\" Nor would he for a long\n\t\t\t\t\ttime accept of the tribunitian authority, or the title of Father of his Country.\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd in regard to the custom of searching those who came to salute him, he\n\t\t\t\t\tdropped it even in the time of the civil war. \n\t\t\t",
        "12":"\n\t\t\t\t He bore with great mildness the freedom used by his friends, the satirical\n\t\t\t\t\tallusions of advocates, and the petulance of philosophers. Licinius Mucianus,\n\t\t\t\t\twho had been guilty of notorious acts of lewdness, but, presuming upon his great\n\t\t\t\t\tservices, treated him very rudely, he re- proved only in private; and when\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplaining of his con- duct to a common friend of theirs, he concluded with\n\t\t\t\t\tthese words, \"However, I am a man.\" Salvius Liberalis, in pleading the. cause of\n\t\t\t\t\ta rich man under prosecution, presuming to say, \"What is it to Caesar, if\n\t\t\t\t\tHipparchus possesses a hundred millions of sesterces?\" he com- mended him for\n\t\t\t\t\tit. Demetrius, the Cynic philosopher, who\n\t\t\t\t\thad been sentenced to banishment, meeting him on the road, and refusing to rise\n\t\t\t\t\tup or salute him, nay, snarling at him in scurrilous language, he only called\n\t\t\t\t\thim a cur. \n\t\t\t",
        "13":"\n\t\t\t\t He was little disposed to keep up the memory of affronts or quarrels, nor did he\n\t\t\t\t\tharbour any resentment on account of them. He made a very splendid marriage for\n\t\t\t\t\tthe daughter of his enemy Vitellius, and gave her, besides, a suitable fortune\n\t\t\t\t\tand equipage. Being in a great consternation after he was forbidden the court in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe time of Nero, and asking those about him, what he should do? or, whither he\n\t\t\t\t\tshould g ? one of those whose office it was to introduce people to the emperor,\n\t\t\t\t\tthrusting him out, bid him go to Morbonia. But when\n\t\t\t\t\tthis same person came afterwards to beg his pardon, he only vented his\n\t\t\t\t\tresentment in nearly the same words. He was so far from being influenced by\n\t\t\t\t\tsuspicion or fear to seek the destruction of any one, that, when his friends\n\t\t\t\t\tadvised him to beware of Metius Pomposianus, because it was commonly believed,\n\t\t\t\t\ton his nativity being cast, that he was destined by fate to the empire, he made\n\t\t\t\t\thim consul, promising for him, that he would not forget the benefit\n\t\t\t\t\tconferred. \n\t\t\t",
        "14":"\n\t\t\t\t It will scarcely be found, that so much as one innocent person suffered in his\n\t\t\t\t\treign, unless in his absence, and without his knowledge, or, at least, contrary\n\t\t\t\t\tto his inclination, and when he was imposed upon. Although Helvidius Priscus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t was the only man who presumed to salute him on his return\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom Syria by his private name of Vespasian, and, when he came to be praetor,\n\t\t\t\t\tomitted any mark of honour to him, or even any mention of him in his edicts, yet\n\t\t\t\t\the was not angry, until Helvidius proceeded to inveigh against him with the most\n\t\t\t\t\tscurrilous language. Though he did indeed banish him, and afterwards ordered him\n\t\t\t\t\tto be put to death, yet he would gladly have saved him notwithstanding, and\n\t\t\t\t\taccordingly dispatched messengers to fetch back the executioners; and he would\n\t\t\t\t\thave saved him, had he not been deceived by a false account brought, that he had\n\t\t\t\t\talready perished. He never ejroiced at the death of any man; nay, he would shed\n\t\t\t\t\ttears, and sigh, atthe just punishment of the guilty. \n\t\t\t",
        "15":"\n\t\t\t\t The only thing deservedly blameable in his character was his love of money. For\n\t\t\t\t\tnot satisfied with reviving the imposts which had been repealed in the time of\n\t\t\t\t\tGalba he imposed new and onerous taxes, augmented the tribute of the provinces,\n\t\t\t\t\tand doubled that of some of them. He likewise openly engaged in a traffic, which\n\t\t\t\t\tis discreditable even to a private\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual, buying great quantities of goods, for the purpose of retailing them\n\t\t\t\t\tagain to advantage. Nay, he made no scruple of selling the great offices of the\n\t\t\t\t\tstate to candidates, and pardons to persons under prosecution, whether they were\n\t\t\t\t\tinnocent or guilty. It is believed, that he advanced all the most rapacious\n\t\t\t\t\tamongst the procurators to high offices, with the view of squeezing them after\n\t\t\t\t\tthey had acquired great wealth. He was commonly said, \"to have used them as\n\t\t\t\t\tsponges,\" because it was his practice, as we may say, to wet them when dry, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsqueeze them when wet. It is said that he was naturally extremely covetous, and\n\t\t\t\t\twas upbraided with it by an old herdsman of his, who, upon the emperor's\n\t\t\t\t\trefusing to enfranchise him gratis, which on his advancement he humbly\n\t\t\t\t\tpetitioned for, cried out, \"That the fox changed his hair, but not his nature.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, some are of opinion, that he was urged to his rapacious\n\t\t\t\t\tproceedings by necessity, and the extreme poverty of the treasury and exchequer,\n\t\t\t\t\tof which he took public notice in the beginning of his reign; declaring that \"no\n\t\t\t\t\tless than four hundred thousand millions of sesterces were wanting to carry on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe government.\" This is the more likely to be true, because he applied to the\n\t\t\t\t\tbest purposes what he procured by bad means. \n\t\t\t",
        "16":"\n\t\t\t\t His liberality, however, to all ranks of people, was excessive. He made up to\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral senators the estate required by law to qualify them for that dignity;\n\t\t\t\t\trelieving likewise such men of consular rank as were poor, with a yearly\n\t\t\t\t\tallowance of five hundred thousand sesterces; and rebuilt, in a better manner than before, several\n\t\t\t\t\tcities in different parts of the empire, which had been damaged by earthquakes\n\t\t\t\t\tor fires. \n\t\t\t",
        "17":"\n\t\t\t\t He was a great encourager of learning and the liberal arts. He first granted to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Latin and Greek professors of rhetoric the yearly stipend of a hundred\n\t\t\t\t\tthousand sesterces each out of the exchequer.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe also bought the freedom of superior poets and artists, and gave a\n\t\t\t\t\tnoble gratuity to the restorer of the Coan Venus, and to another artist who repaired the Colossus. Some one offering to convey some immense columns into\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Capitol at a small expense by a mechanical contrivance, he rewarded him very\n\t\t\t\t\thandsomely for his invention, but would not accept his service, saying, \"Suffer\n\t\t\t\t\tme to find maintenance for the poor people.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "18":"\n\t\t\t\t In the games celebrated when the stage-scenery of the theatre of Marcellus was repaired, restred the old\n\t\t\t\t\tmusical entertainments. He gave Apollinaris, the tragedian, four hundred\n\t\t\t\t\tthousand sesterces, and to Terpinus and Diodorus, the harpers, two hundred\n\t\t\t\t\tthousand; to some a hundred thousand; and the least he gave to any of the\n\t\t\t\t\tperformers was forty thousand, besides many golden crowns. He entertained\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany constantly at his table, and often in great state and very sumptuously,\n\t\t\t\t\tin order to promote trafde. As in the Saturnalia he made presents to the men\n\t\t\t\t\twhich they were to carry away with them, so did he to the women upon the calends\n\t\t\t\t\tof March; \n\t\t\t\t\tnotwithstanding which, he could not wipe off the disrepute of his former\n\t\t\t\t\tstinginess. The Alexandrians called him constantly Cybiosactes; a name wich had\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen. to one of their kings who was sordidly avaricious. Nay, at his funeral,\n\t\t\t\t\tFavo, the principal mimic, personating him, and imitating, as actors do, both\n\t\t\t\t\this manner of speaking and his gestures, asked aloud of the procurators, \"how'\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch his funeral and the procession would cost?\" And being answered \"ten\n\t\t\t\t\tmillions of sesterces,\" he cried out, \"give him but a hundred thousand\n\t\t\t\t\tsesterces, and they might throw his body into the Tiber, if they would.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "19":"\n\t\t\t\t He was broad-set, strong-limbed, and his features gave the idea of a man in the\n\t\t\t\t\tact of straining himself. In consequence, one of the city wits, upon the\n\t\t\t\t\temperor's desiring him \"to say something droll respecting himself,\" facetiously\n\t\t\t\t\tanswered, \"I will, when you have done relieving your bowels.\" He enjoyed a good state of health, though he used no other means to\n\t\t\t\t\tpreserve it, than repeated friction, as much as he could bear, on his neck and\n\t\t\t\t\tother parts of his body, in the tennis-court attached to the baths, besides\n\t\t\t\t\tfasting one day in every month. \n\t\t\t",
        "20":"\n\t\t\t\t His method of life was commonly this. After he became emperor, he used to rise\n\t\t\t\t\tvery early, often before day-break. Having read over his letters, and the briefs\n\t\t\t\t\tof all the departments of the government offices, he admitted his friends; and\n\t\t\t\t\twhile they were paying him their compliments, he would put on his own shoes, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdress himself with his own hands. Then, after the dispatch of such business as\n\t\t\t\t\twas brought before him, he rode out, and afterwards retired to repose, lying on\n\t\t\t\t\this couch with one of his mistresses, of whom he kept several after the death of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCaenis. Coming out of his\n\t\t\t\t\tprivate apartments, he passed to the Bath,\" 'and then entered the supper-room.\n\t\t\t\t\tThey say that he was never more good-humoured and indulgent than at that time:\n\t\t\t\t\tand therefore his attendants always seized that opportunity, when they had any\n\t\t\t\t\tfavour to ask. \n\t\t\t",
        "21":"\n\t\t\t\t At supper, and, indeed, at other times, he was extremely free and jocose. For he\n\t\t\t\t\thad humour, but of a low kind, and he would sometimes use indecent language,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch as is addressed to ygung girls about to be married. Yet there are some\n\t\t\t\t\tthings related of him not void of ingenious pleasantry; amongst which are the\n\t\t\t\t\tfollowing. Being once reminded by Mestrius Florus, that plaustra was a more\n\t\t\t\t\tproper expression than plostra, he the next day saluted him by the name of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFlaurus. A certain lady pretending to\n\t\t\t\t\tbe desperately enamoured of him, he was prevailed upon to admit her to his bed:\n\t\t\t\t\tand after he had gratified her desires, he gave her four hundred thousand sesterces. When his\n\t\t\t\t\tsteward desired to know how he would have the sum entered in his accounts, he\n\t\t\t\t\treplied, \"For Vespasian's being seduced.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "22":"\n\t\t\t\t He used Greek verses very wittily; speaking of a tall man: μακρὰ ζίζασ κραδάων δολλιχώσκιον ἔγχοσ \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd of Cerylus, a freedman, who being very rich had begun to pass himself off as\n\t\t\t\t\tfree-born, to elude the exchequer at 'his decease, and assumed the name of\n\t\t\t\t\tLaches, he said: ὦ Λάχης, Λάχησ \n\t\t\t\t\t\t ἔπαν ἀποθάνης, αὐθίσ ἐξ ἀρχῆσ ἔση Κήρυλοσ \n\t\t\t\t\t Ah, Laches, Laches ! when thou art no more, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Thou'lt Cerylus be called, just as before. He chiefly\n\t\t\t\t\taffected wit upon his own shameful means of raising money, in order to wipe off\n\t\t\t\t\tthe odium by some joke, and turn it into ridicule. One of his ministers, who was\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch in his favour, requesting of him a stewardship for some person, under\n\t\t\t\t\tpretence of his being his brother, he deferred granting him his petition, and in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe meantime sent for the candidate, and having squeezed out of him as much\n\t\t\t\t\tmoney as he had agreed to give to his friend at court, he appointed him\n\t\t\t\t\timmediately to the office. The minister soon after renewing his application,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"You must,\" said he, \"find another brother; for the one you adopted is in truth\n\t\t\t\t\tmine.\" \n\t\t\t\t Suspecting once, during a journey, that his mule-driver had alighted to shoe his\n\t\t\t\t\tmules, only in order to have an opportunity for allowing a person they met, who\n\t\t\t\t\twas engaged in a law-suit, to speak to him, he asked him, \" how much he got for\n\t\t\t\t\tshoeing his mules?\" and insisted on having a share of the profit. When his son\n\t\t\t\t\tTitus blamed him for even laying a tax upon urine, he applied to his nose a\n\t\t\t\t\tpiece of the money he received in the first instalment, and asked him, \" if it\n\t\t\t\t\tstunk?\" And he replying no, \"And yet,\" said he, it is derived from urine.\" Some\n\t\t\t\t\tdeputies having come to acquaint him that a large statue, which would cost a\n\t\t\t\t\tvast sum, was ordered to be erected for him at the public expense, he told them\n\t\t\t\t\tto pay it down immediately, holding out the hollow of his hand, and saying, \"\n\t\t\t\t\tthere was a base ready for the statue.\" Not even when he was under the immediate\n\t\t\t\t\tapprehension and peril of death, could he forbear jesting. For when, among other\n\t\t\t\t\tprodigies, the mausoleum of the Caesars suddenly flew open, and a blazing star\n\t\t\t\t\tappeared in the heavens; one of the prodigies, he said, concerned Julia Calvina,\n\t\t\t\t\twho was of the family of Augustus, \n\t\t\t\t\tand the other, the king of the Parthians, who wore his hair long. And when his\n\t\t\t\t\tdistemper first seized him, \"I suppose.\" he said, \"I shall soon be a god.\" \n\t\t\t",
        "23":"\n\t\t\t\t In his ninth consulship, being seized, while in Campania, with a slight\n\t\t\t\t\tindisposition, and immediately returning to the city, he soon afterwards went\n\t\t\t\t\tthence to Cutiliae, and his estates in the country about Reate,\n\t\t\t\t\twhere he used constantly to spend the summer. Here, though his disorder much\n\t\t\t\t\tincreased, and he injured his bowels by too free use of the cold waters, he\n\t\t\t\t\tnevertheless attended to the dispatch of business, and even gave audience to\n\t\t\t\t\tambassadors in bed. At last, being taken ill of a diarrhoea, to such a degree\n\t\t\t\t\tthat he was ready to faint, he cried out, \"An emperor ought to die standing\n\t\t\t\t\tupright.\" In endeavouring to rise, he died in the hands of those who were\n\t\t\t\t\thelping him up, upon the eighth of the calends of July [24th June], being sixty-nine years, one month, and seven\n\t\t\t\t\tdays old. \n\t\t\t",
        "24":"\n\t\t\t\t All are agreed that he had such confidence in the calculations of his own\n\t\t\t\t\tnativity and that of his sons, that, after several conspiracies against him, he\n\t\t\t\t\ttold the senate, that either his sons would succeed him, or nobody. It is said\n\t\t\t\t\tlikewise, that he once saw in a dream a balance in the middle of the porch of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Palatine house exactly poised; in one scale of which stood Claudius and\n\t\t\t\t\tNero, and in the other, himself and his sons. The event corresponded to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsymbol; for the reigns of the two parties were precisely of the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduration. \n\t\t\t",
        "25":"\n\t\t\t\t Remarks on Vespasian \n\t\t\t\t NEITHER consanguinity nor adoption, as formerly, but great influence in the army\n\t\t\t\t\thaving now become the road to the imperial throne, no person could claim a\n\t\t\t\t\tbetter title to that elevation than Titus Flavius Vespasian. He had not only\n\t\t\t\t\tserved with great reputation in the wars both in Britain and Judaea, but seemed\n\t\t\t\t\tas yet untainted with any vice which could pervert his conduct in the civil\n\t\t\t\t\tadministration of the empire. It appears, however, that he was prompted more by\n\t\t\t\t\tthe persuasion of friends, than by his own ambition, to prosecute the attainment\n\t\t\t\t\tof the imperial dignity. To render this enterprise more successful, recourse was\n\t\t\t\t\thad to a new and peculiar artifice, which, while well accommodated to the\n\t\t\t\t\tsuperstitious credulity of the Romans, impressed them with an idea, that\n\t\t\t\t\tVespasian's destiny to the throne was confirmed by supernatural indications.\n\t\t\t\t\tBut, after his elevation, we hear no more of his miraculous achievements. \n\t\t\t\t The prosecution of the war in Britain, which had been suspended for some years,\n\t\t\t\t\twas resumed by Vespasian; and he sent thither Petilius Cerealis, who by his\n\t\t\t\t\tbravery extended the limits of the Roman province. Under Julius Frontinus,\n\t\t\t\t\tsuccessor to the general, the invaders continued to make farther progress in the\n\t\t\t\t\treduction of the island: but the commander who finally established the dominion\n\t\t\t\t\tof the Romans in Britain, was Julius Agricola, not less distinguished for his\n\t\t\t\t\tmilitary achievements, than for his prudent regard to the civil administration\n\t\t\t\t\tof the country. He began his operations with the conquest of North Wales, whence\n\t\t\t\t\tpassing over into the island of Anglesey, which had revolted since the time of\n\t\t\t\t\tSuetonius Paulinus, he again reduced it to subjection. Then proceeding\n\t\t\t\t\tnorthwards with his victorious army, he defeated the Britons in every\n\t\t\t\t\tengagement, took possession of all the territories in the southern parts of the\n\t\t\t\t\tisland, and driving before him all who refused to submit to the Roman arms,\n\t\t\t\t\tpenetrated even into the forests and mountains of Caledonia. He defeated the\n\t\t\t\t\tnatives under Galgacus, their leader, in a decisive battle; and fixing a line of\n\t\t\t\t\tgarrisons between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he secured the Roman province\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom the incursions of the people who occupied the parts of the island beyond\n\t\t\t\t\tthat boundary. Wherever he established the Roman power, he introduced laws and\n\t\t\t\t\tcivilization amongst the inhabitants, and employed every means of conciliating\n\t\t\t\t\ttheir affection, as well as of securing their obedience. \n\t\t\t\t The war in Judaea, which had been commenced under the former reign, was now\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinued in that of Vespasian; but he left the siege of Jerusalem to be\n\t\t\t\t\tconducted by his son Titus, who displayed great valour and military talents in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe prosecution of the enterprise. After an obstinate defence by the Jews, that\n\t\t\t\t\tcity, so much celebrated in the sacred writings, was finally demolished, and the\n\t\t\t\t\tglorious temple itself, the admiration of the world, reduced to ashes; contrary,\n\t\t\t\t\thowever, to the will of Titus, who exerted his utmost efforts to extinguish the\n\t\t\t\t\tflames. \n\t\t\t\t The manners of the Romans had now attained to an enormous pitch of depravity,\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough the unbounded licentiousness of the times; and, to the honour of\n\t\t\t\t\tVespasian, he discovered great zeal in his endeavours to effect a national\n\t\t\t\t\treformation. Vigilant, active, and persevering, he was indefatigable in the\n\t\t\t\t\tmanagement of public affairs, and rose in the winter before day-break, to give\n\t\t\t\t\taudience to his officers of state. But if we give credit to the whimsical\n\t\t\t\t\timposition of a tax upon urine, we cannot entertain any high opinion, either of\n\t\t\t\t\this talents as a financier, or of the resources of the Roman empire. By his\n\t\t\t\t\tencouragement of science, he displayed a liberality, of which there occurs no\n\t\t\t\t\texample under all the preceding emperors, since the time of Augustus. Pliny the\n\t\t\t\t\telder was now in the height of reputation, as well as in great favour with\n\t\t\t\t\tVespasian; and it was probably owing not a little to the advice of that\n\t\t\t\t\tminister, that the emperor showed himself so much the patron of Literary men. A\n\t\t\t\t\twriter mentioned frequently by Pliny, and who lived in this reign, was Licinius\n\t\t\t\t\tMucianus, a Roman knight: he treated of the history and geography of the eastern\n\t\t\t\t\tcountries. Juvenal, who had begun his Satires several years before, continued to\n\t\t\t\t\tinveigh against the flagrant vices of the times; but the only author whose\n\t\t\t\t\twritings we have to notice in the present reign, is a poet of a different class.\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t"
