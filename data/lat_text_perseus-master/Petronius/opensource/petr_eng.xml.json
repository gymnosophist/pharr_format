My\n                knees are hamstrung, and cannot support my body'? Though indeed even these speeches\n                might be endured if they smoothed the path of aspirants to oratory. But as it is,\n                the sole result of this bombastic matter and these loud empty phrases is that a\n                pupil who steps into a court thinks that he has been carried into another world. I\n                believe that college makes complete fools of our young men, because they see and\n                hear nothing of ordinary life there. It is pirates standing in chainson the beach,\n                tyrants pen in hand ordering sons to cut off their fathers' heads, oracles in time\n                of pestilence demanding the blood of three virgins or more, honey-balls of phrases,\n                every word and act besprinkled with poppy-seed and sesame.People who are fed on this diet can no more be sensible than people who\n                live in the kitchen can be savoury. With your permission I must tell you the truth,\n                that you teachers more than anyone have been the ruin of true eloquence. Your\n                tripping, empty tones stimulate certain absurd effects into being, with the result\n                that the substance of your speech languishes and dies. In the age: when Sophocles or\n                Euripides found the inevitable word for their verse, young men were not yet being\n                confined to set speeches. When Pindar and the nine lyric poets were too modest to\n                use Homer's lines, no cloistered pedant had yet ruined young men's\n                brains. I need not go to the poets for evidence. I certainly do not find that Plato\n                or Demosthenes took any course of training of this kind. Great style, which, if I\n                may say so, is also modest style, is never blotchy and bloated. It rises supreme by\n                virtue of its natural beauty. Your flatulent and formless flow of words is a modern\n                immigrant from Asia to Athens. Its breath fell upon the mind of ambitious youth like\n                the influence of a baleful planet, and when the old tradition was once broken,\n                eloquence halted and grew dumb. In a word, who after this came to equal the\n                splendour of Thucydides or Hyperides? Even poetry did not glow with the colour of\n                health, but the whole of art, nourished on one universal diet, lacked the vigour to\n                reach the grey hairs of old age. The decadence in painting was the same, as soon as\n                Egyptian charlatans had found a short cut to this high calling.\""}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}], "note": ["A teacher of rhetoric.

He\n                    only gives himself away. It is not the slave's fault; he had to do as he was\n                    told. That filthy wife of his rather deserved to be tossed by the bull. But a\n                    man who cannot beat his donkey, beats the saddle. How did Glyco suppose that a\n                    sprig of Hermogenes's sowing would ever come to a good end? He was one for\n                    paring the claws of a kite on the wing, and you do not gather figs from\n                        thistles. Glyco? why, Glyco has given away his own flesh and blood.\n                    He will be branded as long as he lives, and nothing but death will wipe it out.\n                    But a man must have his faults. My nose prophesies a good meal from Mammaea,\n                    twopence each for me and mine. If he does, he will put Norbanus quite in the shade. You know he will\n                    beat him hands down. After all, what has Norbanus ever done for us? He produced\n                    some decayed twopenny-halfpenny gladiators, who would have fallen flat if you\n                    breathed on them; I have seen better ruffians turned in to fight the wild\n                    beasts. He shed the blood of some mounted infantry that might\n                    have come off a lamp; dunghill cocks you would have called them: one a spavined\n                    mule, the other bandylegged, and the holder of the bye, just one corpse instead\n                    of another, and hamstrung. One man, a Thracian, had some stuffing, but he too\n                    fought according to the rule of the schools. In short, they were all flogged\n                    afterwards. How the great crowd roared at them, Lay it on'! They were mere\n                    runaways, to be sure. 'Still, says Norbanus, I did give you a treat.' Yes, and I\n                    clap my hands at you. Reckon it up, and I give you more than I got. One good\n                    turn deserves another. Now, Agamemnon, you\n                    look as if you were saying, 'What is this bore chattering for?' Only because you\n                    have the gift of tongues and do not speak. You do not come off our shelf, and so\n                    you make fun of the way we poor men talk. We know you are mad with much\n                    learning. But I tell you what; can I persuade you to come down to my place some\n                    day and see my little property? We shall find something to eat, a chicken and\n                    eggs: it will be delightful, even though the weather this year has made\n                    everything grow at the wrong time: we shall find something to fill ourselves up\n                    with. My little boy is growing into a follower of yours already. He can do\n                    simple division now; if he lives, you will have a little servant at your heels.\n                    Whenever he has any spare time, he never lifts his nose from the slate. He is\n                    clever, and comes of a good stock, even though he is too fond of birds. I killed\n                    three of his goldfinches just lately, and said a weasel had eaten them. But he\n                    has found some other hobby, and has taken to painting with great pleasure. He\n                    has made a hole in his Greek now, and begins to relish Latin finely, even though\n                    his master is conceited and will not stick to one thing at a time. The boy\n                        comes asking me to give him some writing to do, though he\n                    does not want to work. I have another boy who is no scholar, but very inquiring,\n                    and can teach you more than he knows himself. So on holidays he generally comes\n                    home, and is quite pleased whatever you give him. I bought the child some books\n                    with red-letter headings in them a little time ago. I want him to have a smack\n                    of law in order to manage the property. Law has bread and butter in it. He has\n                    dipped quite deep enough into literature. If he is restless, I mean to have him\n                    learn a trade, a barber or an auctioneer, or at least a barrister, something\n                    that he can carry to the grave with him. So I drum it into him every day: Mark\n                    my words, Primigenius, whatever you learn, you learn for your own good. Look at\n                    Phileros, the barrister: if he had not worked, he would not be keeping the wolf\n                    from the door today. It is not so long since he used to carry things round on\n                    his back and sell them, and now he makes a brave show even against Norbanus.\n                    Yes, education is a treasure, and culture never dies.'"}], "#text": "said Echion,\n                the old clothes dealer."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "47"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "48"}], "quote": [{"pb": {"@id": "p.83"}, "#text": "You will excuse me, gentlemen?

But I swear it was no base passion; I did not\n                    care about her in that way, but rather because she had a beautiful nature. If I\n                    asked her for anything it was never refused me; if she made twopence I had a\n                    penny; whatever I had I put into her pocket, and I was never taken in.

My master happened to have gone to Capua to look after some silly\n                        business or other. I seized my opportunity, and persuaded a guest in our house to come\n                    with me as far as the fifth milestone. He was a soldier, and as brave as Hell.\n                    So we trotted off about cockcrow; the moon shone like high noon. We got among\n                    the tombstones: my man went aside to\n                    look at the epitaphs, I sat down with my heart full of song and began to count\n                    the graves. Then when I looked round at my friend, he stripped himself and put\n                    all his clothes by the roadside. My heart was in my mouth, but I stood like a\n                    dead man. He made a ring of water round his clothes and suddenly turned into a\n                    wolf. Please do not think I am joking; I would not lie about this for any\n                    fortune in the world. But as I was saying, after he had turned into a wolf, he\n                    began to howl, and ran off into the woods. At first I hardly knew where I was,\n                    then I went up to take his clothes; but they had all turned into stone. No one\n                    could be nearer dead with terror than I was. But I drew my sword and went\n                    slaying shadows all the way till I came to my love's house. I\n                    went in like a corpse, and nearly gave up the ghost, the sweat ran down my legs,\n                    my eyes were dull, I could hardly be revived. My dear Melissa was surprised at\n                    my being out so late, and said, 'If you had come earlier you might at least have\n                    helped us; a wolf got into the house and worried all our sheep, and let their\n                    blood like a butcher. But he did not make fools of us, even though he got off;\n                    for our slave made a hole in his neck with a spear.' When I heard this, I could\n                    not keep my eyes shut any longer, but at break of day I rushed back to my master\n                    Gaius's house like a defrauded publican, and when I came to the place where the\n                    clothes were turned into stone, I found nothing but a pool of blood. But when I\n                    reached home, my soldier was lying in bed like an ox, with a doctor looking\n                    after his neck. I realized that he was a werewolf, and I never could sit down to\n                    a meal with him afterwards, not if you had killed me first. Other people may\n                    think what they like about this; but may all your guardian angels punish me if I\n                    am lying."}}, {"milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "63"}, "quote": {"note": {"quote": "a Chian life,", "#text": "Literally  i.e.\n                        luxurious and vicious.

Please make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen. I was once just what you\n                    are, but by my own merits I have come to this. A bit of sound sense is what\n                    makes men; the rest is all rubbish. 'I buy well and sell well': some people will\n                    tell you differently. I am bursting with happiness. What, you\n                    snorer in bed, are you still whining? I will take care that you have something\n                    to whine over. Well, as I was just saying, self-denial has brought me into this\n                    fortune. When I came from Asia I was about as tall as this candle-stick. In fact\n                    I used to measure myself by it every day, and grease my lips from the lamp to\n                    grow a moustache the quicker. Still, I was my master's favourite for fourteen\n                    years. No disgrace in obeying your master's orders. Well, I used to amuse my\n                    mistress too. You know what I mean; I say no more, I am not a conceited man.\n                        Then, as the Gods willed, I became the real master of the\n                    house, and simply had his brains in my pocket. I need only add that I was joint\n                    residuary legatee with Caesar,\n                    and came into an estate fit for a senator. But no one is satisfied with nothing.\n                    I conceived a passion for business. I will not keep you a moment I\n                    built five ships, got a cargo of winewhich was worth its weight in\n                    gold at the timeand sent them to Rome. You may think it was a put-up\n                    job; every one was wrecked, truth and no fairy-tales. Neptune gulped down thirty\n                    million in one day. Do you think I lost heart? Lord! no, I no more tasted my\n                    loss than if nothing had happened. I built some more, bigger, better and more\n                    expensive, so that no one could say I was not a brave man. You know, a huge ship\n                    has a certain security about her. I got another cargo of wine, bacon, beans,\n                    perfumes, and slaves. Fortunata did a noble thing at that time; she sold all her\n                    jewellery and all her clothes, and put a hundred gold pieces into my hand. They\n                    were the leaven of my fortune. What God wishes soon happens. I made a clear ten million on one voyage. I at once bought up all the\n                    estates which had belonged to my patron. I built a house, and bought slaves and\n                    cattle; whatever I touched grew like a honey-comb. When I came to have more than\n                    the whole revenues of my own country, I threw up the game: I retired from active\n                    work and began to finance freedmen. I was quite unwilling to go on with my work\n                    when I was encouraged by an astrologer who happened to come to our town, a\n                    little Greek called Serapa, who knew the secrets of the Gods. He told me things\n                    that I had forgotten myself; explained everything from needle and thread\n                    upwards; knew my own inside, and only fell short of telling me what I had had\n                    for dinner the day before. You would have\n                    thought he had always lived with me. You remember, Habinnas?I believe\n                    you were there? 'You fetched your wife from you know where. You are\n                    not lucky in your friends. No one is ever as grateful to you as you deserve. You\n                    are a man of property. You are nourishing a viper in your bosom,' and, though I\n                    must not tell you this, that even now I had thirty years four months and two\n                    days left to live. Moreover I shall soon come into an estate. My oracle tells me\n                    so. If I could only extend my boundaries to Apulia I should have gone far enough\n                    for my lifetime. Meanwhile I built this house while Mercury watched over\n                        me. As you know, it was a tiny place; now it\n                    is a palace. It has four dining-rooms, twenty bedrooms, two marble colonnades,\n                    an upstairs diningroom, a bedroom where I sleep myself, this viper's boudoir, an\n                    excellent room for the porter; there is plenty of spare room for\n                    guests. In fact when Scaurus came he preferred staying here to anywhere else,\n                    and he has a family place by the sea. There are plenty of other things which I\n                    will show you in a minute. Take my word for it; if you have a penny, that is\n                    what you are worth; by what a man hath shall he be reckoned.

So when she had buried her husband, the common fashion of following the\n                procession with loose hair, and beating the naked breast in front of the crowd, did\n                not satisfy her. She followed the dead man even to his resting-place, and began to\n                watch and weep night and day over the body, which was laid in an underground vault\n                in the Greek fashion. Neither her parents nor her relations could divert her from\n                thus torturing herself, and courting death by starvation; the officials were at last\n                rebuffed and left her; every one mourned for her as a woman of unique character, and\n                she was now passing her fifth day without food. A devoted maid sat\n                by the failing woman, shed tears in sympathy with her woes, and at the same time\n                filled up the lamp, which was placed in the tomb, whenever it sank. There was but\n                one opinion throughout the city, every class of person admitting this was the one\n                true and brilliant example of chastity and love. At this moment the governor of the\n                province gave orders that some robbers should be crucified near the small building\n                where the lady was bewailing her recent loss. So on the next night, when the soldier\n                who was watching the crosses, to prevent anyone taking down a body for burial,\n                observed a light shining plainly among the tombs, and heard a mourner's groans, a\n                very human weakness made him curious to know who it was and what he was doing. So he\n                went down into the vault, and on seeing a very beautiful woman, at first halted in\n                confusion, as if he had seen a portent or some ghost from the world beneath. But\n                afterwards noticing the dead man lying there, and watching the woman's tears and the\n                marks of her nails on her face, he came to the correct conclusion, that she found\n                her regret for the lost one unendurable. He therefore brought his supper into the\n                tomb, and began to urge the mourner not to persist in useless grief, and break her\n                heart with unprofitable sobs: for all men made the same end and found the same\n                resting-place, and so on with the other platitudes which restore wounded spirits to\n                health. But she took no notice of his sympathy, struck and tore her breast more\n                violently than ever, pulled out her hair, and laid it on the dead body. Still the\n                soldier did not retire, but tried to give the poor woman food with similar\n                encouragements, until the maid, who was no doubt seduced by the smell of his wine, first gave in herself, and put out her hand at his kindly\n                invitation, and then, refreshed with food and drink, began to assail her mistress's\n                obstinacy, and say, 'What will you gain by all this, if you faint away with hunger,\n                if you bury yourself alive, if you breathe out your undoomed soul before Fate calls\n                for it?'

So the lady, being\n                thirsty after several days' abstinence, allowed her resolution to be broken down,\n                and filled herself with food as greedily as the maid, who had been the first to\n                yield."}, {"milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "112"}, "quote": {"note": {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "neid"}, "#text": "See Virgil,  iv, 38."}, "pb": {"@id": "p.235"}, "#text": "Well, you know which temptation generally assails a man on a full stomach.\n                    The soldier used the same insinuating phrases which had persuaded the lady to\n                    consent to live, to conduct an assault upon her virtue.

Victory makes my exile doubly\n                sure. My rout of the Germans and my sixty triumphs were the beginning of my\n                offences. Yet who is it that fears my fame, who are the men that watch me fight?\n                Base hirelings bought at a price, to whom my native Rome is a stepmother. But I\n                think that no coward shall bind my strong arm unhurt without a blow in return. Come,\n                men, to victory while anger is hot, come, my comrades, and plead our cause with the\n                sword. For we are all summoned under one charge, and the same doom hangs over us\n                all. My thanks are your due, my victory is not mine alone. Wherefore, since\n                punishment threatens our trophies, and disgrace is the meed of\n                conquest, let Chance decide how our lot shall fall. Raise the standard and prove\n                your strength. My pleading at least is accomplished; armed amid so many warriors I\n                cannot know defeat.' As he spoke these words aloud, the Delphic bird in the sky gave\n                a happy omen, and beat the air as it flew. And from the left quarter of a gloomy\n                grove strange voices sounded and fire flashed thereafter.
