The days are past when Scaliger could compare\nVirgil and  in detail, and pronounce that the scholar had in\nalmost every instance excelled his master; nor would a modern reader\neasily tolerate even those less invidious parallels, such as were not infrequent\nin the last century, where  was measured against \non the same principles on which Johnson has measured Pope against\nDryden, and with substantially the same results. It is hard to read\nwithout a smile the apologetic tone in which Pope himself vindicates\nHomer against the admirers of , pleading that the old Greek has\nat all events the advantage of having written first; that if he had a less\ncool judgment, he holds the heart under a stronger enchantment, and\nthat to endeavour to exalt  at his expense is much the same as if\none should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation. It is now the turn of the critic of the Aeneid to use the language\nof extenuation and speak with bated breath. On the one side it\nis admitted, as it is asserted on the other, that in undertaking the\nAeneid at the command of a superior  was venturing beyond the\nprovince of his genius, and that all we can expect to find is the incidental\nsuccess which could not fail to be obtained even on uncongenial\nground by the poet of the Georgics. I have elsewhere explained the\nreasons which lead me to question the appropriateness of the special\npraise usually given to 's agricultural poetry, and conceded, though\nwith more hesitation, to his pastoral compositions, as if the true bent of\nhis mind were to be found in his sympathy with external nature, at the\nsame time that I have spoken as strongly as it was in my power to\nspeak of the marvellous grace and delicacy, the evidences of a culture\nmost elaborate and most refined, which shine out in the midst of a\nthousand incongruities of costume and outward circumstance, and make\nus forget that we are reading Bucolic poems of which line after line is to\nbe found in Theocritus, and precepts about husbandry which are far more\n\nintelligibly stated in Theophrastus or in the Geoponica. It is precisely\nthis measure which I would wish now to extend to the Aeneid. So far\nit may seem that I am substantially at one with the opinion which I\nhave mentioned as that which is now generally entertained on Virgil's\nclaims as an epic poet. It is possible however that the habit of sharply\ncontrasting the characteristics of the several works of  may have\nled to an exaggeration on the one side, as I believe it has on the other,\nthat the Aeneid may have been brought too exclusively to the standard\nof the  and , and that  may have been blamed, as\nPope complains that  has been blamed, for not doing what he\nnever intended."}, {"persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, "Brutus", {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, "Horace", "Propertius", {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Pliny"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, "Homer", {"surname": "Virgil"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "2", "#text": "Gossrau, Praef. ad Aeneidem."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "3", "#text": "Macrobius, Sat. i. 24."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "4", "#text": "Nat.

We have his\nown confession in the Sixth Eclogue that his early ambition was to sing\nof kings and battles: and though Phoebus may have whispered in his\near that such themes were too high for one so young, so humble, and so\nunknown, we are not obliged to conclude that the aspiration was then\nand there finally abandoned, or that as he rose naturally from short\npastorals to a long didactic poem, he may not have cherished the hope\nof rising by an equally natural ascent to a still longer epic. If Pope's\nepic poem of Alcander was the dream of his boyhood, when he fancied\nhimself the greatest poet that ever lived, his epic poem on  was\nno less the vision of his later years, when he had come, as he thought,\nto take a just measure of his powers. That Augustus may have exercised\nsome pressure on , urging him to undertake heroic poetry,\nis very possible; but 's words in the Third Georgic, and the similar\nlanguage held by other poets, such as  and , would\nlead us to agree with a recent German editor, that what the emperor\nwished for was a direct celebration of his own actions; nor is there anything,\neven in the apocryphal notices of the pseudo-biographer, to compel\nus to any other conclusion. It was only natural that Augustus should\ntake an interest, as we know him to have done, in the progress of a\npoem which, in grandeur of scope and compass, promised to transcend\nany previous effort of the Roman muse, and so could not but reflect indirect\nglory on his reign. We may observe, however, that in the only\nwords of  on the subject which have come down to us the poet\nexpresses himself with considerable reserve, and is by no means forward\nto gratify the imperial curiosity. Nor need we to lay any stress on the\nstory which, supported as it is by the authority of the elder , there\nseems no reason to doubt, that  himself, when dying, condemned\nhis Aeneid to the flames. Rightly understood, that story seems to contain,\n\nnot a confession that he had mistaken his powers, but simply one\nmore instance of the fastidious and exacting nature of his self-criticism.\nThe words of the pseudo-biographer, who in this case at least is telling\na plausible tale, inform us distinctly that it was the uncorrected and\nunfinished state of the work which made  anxious that it should\nnot survive him, \nThe explanation is consonant to all that we know of 's character,\nas shown in his writings; and it can only be a private opinion which we\nmay ourselves entertain about the merit of the poem that would lead us\nto seek for any other. The biographer tells us, and here again his story\nis credible enough, that  was overtaken by death at the time when\nhe was intending to spend three years in polishing and elaborating the\nAeneid: and we may imagine for ourselves what would be the value of\nthree years of correction in the judgment of a poet like , and how\nabortive he might consider the work which had lost the advantage of so\nlong a gestation. We cannot, indeed, tell, except in a very few\nobvious cases, such as the hemistichs, and perhaps also certain inconsistencies\nin the narrative, of which I have spoken elsewhere, what\nmay have been the actual shortcomings of the poem as they appeared\nto its author. He may have introduced verses, as the story says he\ndid, which were intended as mere temporary make-shifts, props to\nstay the building until more solid supports should be forthcoming; but\nmodern criticism has not in general been very happy in pointing out\nthese weak places, and for the present we must be content to admit\nthat, as regards the execution of the poem, at any rate, our conceptions\nof what is required fall infinitely short of 's own; and that\nthough we may hope, in some measure, to appreciate what he has done,\nwe can form no notion of what he left yet to do. Such an admission\nof ignorance is no more than the tribute which we pay, naturally and\ncheerfully, to a consummate artist. In any case, we need not doubt\nthat the feeling which made  wish to rob the world of his\ngreatest poem was simply the mortification of leaving in a state of\ncomparative imperfection a work which he had intended to be his\nmasterpiece. To imagine that he was sensible of the unreality which,\nto a certain extent, characterizes the Aeneid, as compared with the\nHomeric poems, is to imagine an anachronism and an impossibility, to\nattribute to him a thought which is inconsistent with the whole tenor of\nhis writings, and must have been alien to the entire current of sentiment\namong his contemporaries, whether admiring or adverse. He\nseems never to have tormented himself with doubts that he had not\nrealized the rustic vigour of Theocritus, or the primitive simplicity of\n\nHesiod. He appropriates their form boldly and openly, and does not\nask himself whether he has reproduced their spirit. To be the Roman\n; to write the sequel of the tale of , not as an inferior, but\nas an equal, not as a younger son of the victorious race, but as the heir\nof those many ages which had lifted the conquered people to a height\nfar above their conquerors; to combine the glories of the heroic age\nwith the august antiquities of his own nation; this was an ideal which\nmight well captivate a mind like 's, and which less partial voices\nthan those of an applauding court might have told him that he was able\nto attain."}, {"title": ["Iliad", "Odyssey", "Iliad"], "persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}], "placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "8", "persName": {"surname": "Homer"}, "#text": "Studies on , vol. iii. p. 502.

But the period which witnessed the establishment of\nthe empire generated new hopes and aspirations among the poets of\n.

In the\nlong hours of laborious days, paring down and refining the verses which\nhad been poured out in the exuberance of the morning, he had grappled\n\nwith the Grecian Hercules, and had again and again wrested from\nhim that weapon which had so long been the terror of meaner freebooters.

The lions had at last come to be\nthe painters; and though they could not represent their progenitor as\nvictorious over the man in that great legendary struggle, they could\nportray it as a contest of fraud and cruelty with heroic endurance\nand genuine bravery; they could poise the event more doubtfully in the\nbalance, and call down indignation on the crimes that stained the hour\nof triumph; they could point to the retribution which fell, even within\nthe period of the legend, on the homes of those who had made others\nhomeless, and shadow forth in prophetic vision the yet more terrible\n\nrecompense which history was to bring in the fulness of time. Aeneas\nis drawn by  at a time when, from the nature of the case, he\ncould only play a secondary part in the action; yet  admits his\nreputation among his countrymen, and grudgingly concedes his real\nprowess, while he makes the Trojan hero's future the special concern of\ndestiny, provided for even by those gods who are the fiercest enemies of\n.  takes up his story when he is left alone as the one surviving\nprotector of his country, the forlorn hope of those who sought to\nresist, during the sack of the city, the recognized leader of the Trojan\nmigration. Worsted as he had been by Achilles, and even by Diomed,\nit was no less true that he had been a terror to the Lords of the Danaans\nand the armies of Agamemnon; nor was there any reason why he and\nhis Trojans should not prove too strong for the Italian nations, though\nthey had proved too weak for the forces of . Even in  it\nis easy to see that the character of  has more sides than one: he\nis the prince of policy, because with him every species of fraud is lawful;\nand it is natural that his stratagems should be differently estimated by\nthose in whose favour they are exercised and those to whom they\nbrought havoc, exile, and death. , it is true, represents his\n as engaging in crimes from which the Homeric Ulysses would\nprobably have shrunk; but we must not judge a poet as we should judge\na historian who were to invent actions in order to support a preconceived\ntheory of character. If the right of independent treatment be conceded,\nit must be allowed to extend, not only to the interpretation of character,\nbut to the invention of incident. Regarding  as a party chronicler,\n was not bound to assume that he has recorded all the actions\nof his hero, any more than that he has given a true colour to those\nactions which he has recorded. And so the poet of , having taken\nsuch a measure as it was in the nature of a Trojan to take of 's\nsubtlest enemy, might fairly avail himself of any post-Homeric tradition\nwhich might serve the cause that he had to advocate, or even create for\nhimself new traditions, so long as they were plausible and consistent.\n To be plausible\nand consistent are a poet's sole historical duties; and in this instance\nplausibility and consistency are to be estimated, not according to the\nview which sets up  as the one record of historical truth, but\naccording to that which regards his poems as pieces of advocacy,\nthe answers to which have been lost. The image is indeed something\nmore than a mere metaphor. We know that in the Greek\nschools of rhetoric attempts were frequently made to overturn the\nverdict, not only of history, but of fable; and we may recall with a\nsmile the fact that it was not merely sophistical acumen, but real\nsympathy with a friendly nation, which led Greek orators to rehabilitate\n\nBusiris, and purge  from the stain of a legendary participation in\nthe guilt of human sacrifices.  has obtained leave to reargue the\ncase of his countrymen; and all that is required of him is that his facts\nand inferences should be such as would have been credible to a Trojan\nwarrior. Bearing this in mind, we may remember that if Aeneas calls\n   and  it is when he\nis speaking of the sack of , or of the carrying off of the statue\nwhich made  impregnable. If Sinon represents him as a treacherous,\nartful glozer, it is when he is describing plots laid against his\nfriend's life and his own. If Deiphobus knows him only as the counsellor\nof deeds of wrong, we may pardon the one-sided judgment of a\nperson who has been hewn by him as a carcase fit for hounds, and\ncontinues mangled even in his ghostly body. Such men were not\nlikely to sympathize with the admiration expressed by the Homeric\nAntenor, as, on the day that was to bring the war to a peaceful close,\nhe recalled the impression made on him by his illustrious guest in bygone\nyears, before the war began. Nor is it less perfectly in keeping\nthat the Rutulians should disparage the wiles of  in comparison\nof their own more daring exploits, at the same time that it leads us\nto admire the art of the poet, who has thus condemned the most\nformidable enemies of  out of the mouth of other enemies, who were\ndestined to prove less formidable. As little could it be expected that\nthe  of  should appreciate the lights and shades distributed\nover the character of the Homeric Helen. How he regarded her during\nthe siege we are not told; he may have shared the mixed feeling of\nadmiration and disapproval which the old men on the wall express in\ntheir hour of respite; he may have partaken of the sense of repulsion\nwith which, as she tells us in her wail over , she was looked upon\nby all in ; but as his eye fell upon her at the moment of the sack\nof the royal palace, and the savage slaughter of the good old king,\nthoughts of hatred and vengeance could hardly fail to be uppermost in\nhis mind; and he may well have needed a supernatural interposition to\nteach him to distinguish between the authors of so terrible a ruin and\nits wretched instrument. Let us once fix in our minds that  is\nthe poet of the Greeks, and that his action is laid during the siege, that\n is the poet of the Trojans, and that his action is laid after the\nburning of the city, and we shall not, I think, be disposed to charge\n with mere wanton depravation of the Homeric characters."}, {"persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Homer"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Homer"}, "Jupiter", "Juno", "Mars", {"surname": "Homer"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "perseus,Troy", "#text": "Troy"}, {"@key": "perseus,Pergamon", "#text": "Pergamus"}, {"@key": "perseus,Troy", "#text": "Ilion"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000074", "#text": "Greece"}, {"@key": "tgn,7000084", "#text": "Germany"}], "pb": [{"@n": "11"}, {"@n": "12"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "5", "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7016833", "#text": "Egypt"}, "#text": "See Bunsen, , vol. i. pp. 152 foll.

A story of the heroic\ntime of , treated in an essentially modern and Roman spirit, was\nsure to leave a sense of incongruity on the mind, not only of a Homeric\nstudent, but of a more popular reader. A reader of this sort might be\nutterly unconscious of a thousand inaccuracies of costume; he might\nfeel the loss of primitive simplicity of manner to be compensated by the\ngreater stateliness of the modern heroic; but he could scarcely fail to\nbe struck with an essential want of consistency in the drawing of the\nprincipal figures, which, being Homeric, must necessarily be old, and\nbeing Virgilian, must as necessarily be new. It is this, I think, which\nconstitutes the secret of the dissatisfaction which is generally felt with\nthe character of Aeneas. To represent him, as some modern critics\nhave done, as simply mean and feeble, unmanly and unheroic, is unjust,\nand even absurd. His appearances in  ought not to prejudice\nour opinion about his appearances in ; nor perhaps would they,\nwere it not for an error in judgment committed by the poet himself,\nwho, in his spirit of dramatic fair dealing towards his hero's enemies,\na spirit which will call for our notice again very shortly,makes them\ntaunt him with his Homeric escapes and evasions of danger, allowing\nthem, at the same time, to confound what  never would have\nconfounded, and identify a warlike Trojan with an effeminate Phrygian.\nWe are wearied, it must be confessed, by being continually reminded of\nhis piety; though that may be partly owing to our misapprehension of\nthe use of the epithet, which was doubtless intended to be a Homeric\none, attached to the name as a sort of prefix, and to be taken as a\nmatter of course; but his piety is not merely nominal; it shows itself in\nhis whole feeling and conduct to the gods, his father, and his son.\nHeyne, who had a soul to admire and reverence both  and ,\nremarks on the dignity and beauty of 's address to .\nHis faithfulness to the memory of  is all the more noble, as apparently\nbeing not, like that of  to his dead friend, grounded on\nstrong personal affection, but rather the offspring of generous selfreproach\nfor his own involuntary failure to discharge a sacred trust.\n\nHis long forbearance towards Lausus, and the revulsion of feeling when\nhe sees him dead, contrasts strangely with the  with\nwhich Turnus exults in the prospect of killing , and glories over\nhim when killed. But the greater the tenderness and grace of these\ntraits of character, the harsher the jar with which we find the hero of\nthe Aeneid exhibiting at other times the savage, indomitable spirit of\nthe hero of the . There is tenderness, deep tenderness, mingled\nwith the ferocity of Achilles; yet we are not surprised when, after receiving\nPriam graciously, and losing his own sorrows in sympathy with\nthe poor old king, he is roused to momentary fury by a word spoken out\nof season. But the temper of  is less impulsive, and his gentleness\nmore abiding and untroubled, so that our feelings are shocked\nwhen we see him plunging his hands in blood as deeply as a Homeric\nwarrior, and reserving the sons of two families to be sacrificed alive on\nthe funeral pile of his friend. It is in keeping with the manners of the\nheroic age; but it is not in keeping with the humanity with which the\npoet's modern spirit has led him to invest the rest of the character. It\nis this inconsistency between the heroic and the modern type which we\nfeel in Aeneas's treatment of . Stripped of its accessories, the conduct\nof Aeneas to  is not very unlike that of  to Calypso,\nif not to Circe. He is thrown on her coast; he is treated hospitably;\nhe accepts the position of a husband; he leaves her that he may go to\nhis natural home. It can hardly be said that the deity of Calypso constitutes\nan essential difference between her and . If she is a goddess,\nher words show that she feels the love and even the jealousy of a\nwoman; and the criticism which contrasts 's farewell to her\nwith the language of Aeneas to  might perhaps have been spared,\nif it had been recollected that in  she herself receives the order\nfrom the gods to part with , while in  the whole burden is\nthrown upon Aeneas, who has not only to justify himself for going, but\nto vouch for the supernatural compulsion under which he goes. But\nfor a hero to leave a mortal love was no novelty in the heroic age, as the\ntitles of Ovid's Heroic Epistles sufficiently show. The novelty is in the\ninterest which  has excited in the situation and feelings of his\nforsaken heroine. He has struck the chord of modern passion, and\npowerfully has it responded; more powerfully, perhaps, than the minstrel\nhimself expected. Had  written of , we should probably\nhave been called on to sympathize with her but little; our feelings\nwould have been with the hero whom she strove to keep from the home\nwhither he was bound. There were reasons which might have induced\n to give a similar colour to his narrative. All his sympathies are\n\nRoman; and the breach between  and  is the symbol and\nthe prophecy of the quarrel of  and . It is hard, too, to\nsuppose that in sketching the Carthaginian queen, who endeavours to\nkeep Aeneas from his kingdom, he did not think again and again of the\nEgyptian enchantress to whom Antony would have transferred the\nsceptre of the western world, whose blandishments had prevailed over\nthe great Julius, and had been successfully resisted by Octavianus\nalone. Circe might have supplied the legendary framework, \nthe animating historical spirit; and even though the Trojan Ulysses\nhad yielded to the allurements of the charmer, we might have hailed the\nflash of his drawn sword, and sent our hearts along with him in his\njourney from the enchanted shore.

Following in the track of Apollonius, he has lavished\nall his art on the presentation of a vivid portrait of female passion.\n's flame has been kindled, not from within, but from without, by a\nsupernatural power; the generosity of her nature has already shown\nitself in the princely hospitality which she extends to Aeneas and his\nshipwrecked comrades; but, after all, we sympathize with her simply as\na woman; it is the mere exhibition of the depths of a woman's heart\nthat stirs our own so powerfully. Other heroes have loved and left as\nAeneas does; few have had as strong a justification as he can plead for\nhis flight: but no one seems to us so traitorous as Aeneas, except it be\nJason; and the reason lies in the depth of colouring with which ,\nlike Euripides, has painted the agonies of the abandoned queen."}, {"persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, "Homer", {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}], "title": "Iliad", "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,1000074", "#text": "Greece"}, {"@key": "perseus,Troy", "#text": "Troy"}], "pb": {"@n": "15"}, "quote": "he so greatly delighted in the\nepic cycle as to have borrowed whole dramas from its contents,", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "*coanhfo/roi"}, "#text": "The relation of  to , as I have said already, unquestionably\nfurnishes the most important point of view from which the Aeneid\ncan be regarded by one who wishes to estimate the surrounding circumstances\nwhich told upon the genius of the Augustan poet.

It is the spirit of the\ndrama allowing itself free play; and the result is the enlargement of\nhuman sympathy, the vindication of the weaker as well as of the\nstronger.

The\nfates of the combatants have been balanced by , and we know\nthat in a short time the only obstacle that keeps Aeneas from his\ndestined empire will be removed by Turnus's death. Yet that brief\nspace only serves to intensify our interest for the doomed man; our wishes\nlend him wings as he is flying for his life, and calling by name on each\nof his terrified comrades; and we echo the agonized prayer in which\nhe implores the gods of his native land to hold fast Aeneas's spear.

The appearance\nof Helen in the Troades of Euripides, where her more than\nfeminine logic is overpowered by the superior logic of Hecuba, intensified\nby hatred, made it easier for  to represent her as he has\ndone in the second and sixth books of the Aeneid, though that representation,\nas I have said previously, was forced upon him by the circumstances\nof his story, and is sufficiently justified by them.

It is a signal instance of\nthe kinship of genius asserting itself against the rival affinities of outward\ncondition and circumstance. The style of Apollonius is a literary\nstyle, the epic language of  reproduced and modified by a modern\nstudent: but though it is sometimes graceful and ingenious, compared\nwith the style of  it is the mere jargon of a grammarian, seeking\nto revive a mode of speech of which he had no living appreciation. His\ntreatment of his subject makes us think of the  and the Aeneid,\nbut it is by way of contrast; where he is felicitous, the felicity is not of\nan epic character, and the general tenor of the narrative is tedious and\nuninteresting, and therefore neither Homeric nor Virgilian. A catalogue\nof heroes is in itself a sufficiently epic thing, yet we feel that\nneither  nor  would have dreamed of commencing a poem\nwith it, as the reader must be made to sympathize in the object of the\nmuster before the muster-roll can have any meaning to him. The\nincidents of the voyage have either no interest at all, or an interest\n\nunconnected with the main purpose of the poem. In the narratives of\nthe Odyssey and the Aeneid everything bears on the fortunes of\n and his crew, or on those of Aeneas regarded as the future\nfounder of the Trojan nation; the voyages are sufficiently diversified,\nbut the object of every event is to illustrate the action of the contending\npowers whose strife keeps the prince of  from his home, the chief\nof  from his destined kingdom. But in Apollonius there is little or\nnothing of this; the voyage was part of his poem; it had to be made an\neventful one, and events are produced accordingly. We do not see the\nobject of the sojourn in , or of the fight between Pollux and\nAmycus; even Phineus seems to be introduced rather for his own sake\nthan for the aid which his prophecy affords to the voyagers. They lose\nsome of their comrades; but even the loss of  scarcely impresses\nitself on us, and that of Tiphys is more easily remedied than we should have\nexpected. The Third Book is the gem of the whole poem, and may beread\nwith real pleasure, even by those whose recollection of  is fresh and\nvivid. , indeed, has not chosen to contend directly with Apollonius;\nhe concentrates his strength on the picture of  in her abandonment\nand despair, and touches more lightly the early approaches of the love\nthat was to undo her. The object of Apollonius is different; Medea,\nthe forsaken and desperate wife, formed no part of the argument of his\npoem; his Medea is a maiden in her father's palace, and he has to paint\nthe steps by which, under the agency of the god of love, she resigns all\nher feelings for home, and is delivered heart and soul to the power of\nenchantments more mighty than her own. Accordingly, when she retires\nto her chamber we have her thoughts and also her dreams; the\nlast not simply mentioned, like 's on the night after Aeneas's story,\nbut recounted. She goes to her sister, who is fortunately as excited as\nshe, though from a different cause; and even an arrangement which\ngives her hope of binding Jason to herself does not prevent her from\npassing the dreary midnight hours in an agony of hopeless longing,\nwhich she is at one time nearly ending by swallowing a drug from her\nown casket of poisons. Yet, though there is power and beauty here, it\nis not the power and beauty of . Even the passage in which\nMedea, with the casket lying open on her lap, is struck with a sudden\nhorror of death, and feels as she never felt before, that  deep as is its truth\nand pathos, does not affect us as we expect to be affected by an incident\nin an epic poem. It is too modern for Homer;  might have\nowned the feeling, but he would have been content to indicate it in two\nor three lines. The conference of Here and , and their joint\nvisit to Aphrodite, are evidently imitated from Here's visit to Aphrodite\nin the Fourteenth Book of the , and are as evidently 's model\n\nin the scene between  and Cupid at the end of the First Aeneid,\nand that between  and  at the beginning of the Fourth; but\nthey do not impress the reader as he is impressed by their Greek original,\nor by their Latin copy; they are graceful, fanciful, in a word,\nOvidian; but they are not epic. The description of Love overreaching\nGanymede at dice, the boy-god erect and radiant, his playmate pouting\nand pettish, is obviously made for painting; but the picture would not\nfind a place in a heroic gallery. Nor is Apollonius writing in the  when he introduces Aphrodite playfully pinching her son's cheek,\nand bribing him to attack Medea by a promise of the magic ball with\nwhich Zeus played when a babe in his cavern-nursery of Ida. The interview\nbetween Jason and Medea in the temple of Hecate is tender\nand touching; but  would never have descended to the prettiness\nof the comparison of the two lovers, bashful and silent, to tall pine-trees\nat first standing still in the calm, and then breaking into a rustle under\nthe agitation of the wind: a simile which Valerius Flaccus has to tone\ndown and render less graphic in order to adapt it to the genius of his\nquasi-Virgilian imitation. When the voyage recommences, the poem\nagain ceases to interest us. The treacherous murder of Absyrtus is\nnarrated in a manner to excite pity and terror; but we have heard too\nlittle of the youth to feel much personal concern in his fate. The ineffectual\nappeal of Medea to the greater sorceress, Circe, is better in\nconception than in execution. The adventures of the suppliants in\nPhaeacia have rather the grotesqueness of romance than the dignity of\nepic narrative. The other incidents of the homeward voyage, like those\nof the voyage out, seem as if related for an emergency, not evolved by\nthe internal necessities of the story; and the few lines in which the heroes\nare at last dismissed may perhaps show that the poet had come to be as\nweary of the subject as his readers. The Homeric poems, according to\nLonginus, contain many slips, the Argonautics none; yet, asks the\ncritic, who would not rather be  than Apollonius? It required\n\nbut little confidence to put the question; but few, I imagine, would now\naccept the previous judgment on which it is based. If  sometimes\nnods, Apollonius may be said to be only occasionally awake,\nthough his long fits of somnolency are relieved by fanciful and even\nattractive dreams."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000074", "#text": "Greece"}, {"@key": "perseus,Troy", "#text": "Troy"}], "persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Homer"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Homer"}, "Hercules", {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, "Dido", "Venus", "Jupiter", {"surname": "Virgil"}], "quote": [{"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "7", "#text": "Watts, quoted in Johnson's Life of Pope."}, "#text": "there is scarcely a happy combination of words, or a phrase\npoetically elegant, in his native language, which he has not inserted into\nhis poems;"}, {"@lang": "la", "l": ["Amborum uxores", "Noctu Troiad exibant capitibus opertis", "Flentes ambae abeuntes lacrimis cum multis,"]}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "8", "#text": "Donatus,  18. 71."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "9", "quote": [{"@lang": "la", "emph": "O socii", "#text": ". . . et totus hic locus de Naevio belli Punici lib.\ntranslatus est."}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Sunt alii loci plurimorum versuum quos Maro\nin opus suum cum paucorum inmutatione verborum a veteribus transtulit. . . .

Every reader of the Aeneid will remember lines resembling\n  \n    lines, some of which, when\n\nwe meet them in Virgil, strike us with no want of smoothness or finish,\nwhile others, though somewhat rougher, serve to vary the harmony which\nthey do not really interrupt. The Latin hexameter, under all its modifications,\nhas characteristics which distinguish it from the Greek; and as\nEnnius was its originator, he may claim to be the author of Virgil's\nversification, even in cases where nothing like imitation can be pretended.\nEnnius did not naturalize his new importation until the language\ninto which it was introduced had lost some portion of its original\nplasticity; he had accordingly, as has been ably shown by a German\nwriter, to adopt a certain conventionalism of expression, innovating\nhere, paraphrasing there, in order to avoid obvious words which happened\nto be unsuitable to his metre; and though  was not likely\nto follow him in his harsher  his  or his  the same necessity which pressed\non the elder poet pressed on the younger also, making him fall into the\nstyle of epic commonplace which already existed, and augment it by a\nthousand new and ingenious devices of his own. All this we may admit,\nas we have made similar admissions in the case of Apollonius; yet it\nmay still be true that Virgil's debt to Ennius is so trifling as to be\nscarcely worth computation. We know too little of Ennius to be\nable to estimate his merits as a narrator; hundreds of his verses have\ncome down to us, but very few passages which exceed three or four\nlines, and of these scarcely any can be called pieces of narrative.\nThere is indeed a description of an invincible tribune in the Histrian\nwar, bathed in sweat and exposed to a hailstorm of javelins, which\nVirgil doubtless had before him while painting Turnus at the end of the\nninth Aeneid; but the model is itself a copy from the single-handed\nresistance of the Homeric Ajax in the sixteenth Iliad, which would\nsufficiently account for Virgil's imitation if the fragment of the Annals\nhad never been preserved by Macrobius, while it leaves us no means of\njudging how Ennius would have treated such a situation if he had not\nhad  to draw from. The account of Romulus and Remus waiting\nfor the augury, preserved by Cicero in the first book of his De Divinatione,\nis not a very remarkable specimen of narrative power. Homer\nwould have introduced more details;  would have treated those\nwhich Ennius gives in a more artificial way, dwelling on one or two,\nand hinting the rest; both would probably have thrown in some short\nspeech, directly or indirectly expressed, to show the feeling of the rival\nbrothers and the attendant multitude. But without venturing farther\non the precarious ground of hypothetical criticism, we need scarcely\n\ndoubt that there was nothing in Ennius's conception of his art which\nVirgil was likely to welcome as a help towards improving upon Homer.\nLiving in a pre-historic time,  (I use the name for convenience'\nsake, not as taking a side in the controversy about his personality) is\nthe only poet who has attained the grace and finish of a literary period;\nhe is the only primeval poet so complete in himself that it might be\nquestioned whether it would have been an advantage to him to have\nlived later. There may conceivably be one or two touches in Ennius\nwhich appear to show a more modern feeling than Homer's, a keen\nsense of colour, an appreciation of philosophy and literature as such;\nfor an age, even when relatively less advanced than some former age, is\nyet in a certain sense the heir of all that have gone before it, and the age\nof Ennius in particular possessed the rudiments of criticism and aspired\nafter culture; but, regarded in the gross,  is mature and articulate,\nwhile Ennius is still crude and infantine, and it was not to be\nexpected that the large utterance of the divine foretime of Greece\nshould come mended to Virgil's ear when repeated by the stammering\nlips of his Italian ancestors.  may have believed, as Ennius did,\nthat the soul which dwelt in his own breast had once animated Homer;\nbut he probably would not have recognized Ennius as the intermediate\nchannel of its transmission."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "8", "persName": {"surname": "Virgil"}, "quote": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Desierant latrare canes, urbesque silebant:\nOmnia noctis erant, placida conposta quiete."}, "bibl": {"@n": "Apollon. 3.749", "#text": "Apoll. 3. 749"}, "#text": "Seneca (Controv. 16, p. 238) says that Montanus Julius praised  for having\nimproved (in his description of night, A. 8. 27, foll.) on two lines of Varro:\n\nVirgil, however, is not nearer to Varro than he is to Varro's original, , foll."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "9", "quote": {"@lang": "la", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "ou)d' ei)/ moi de/ka me\\n glw=ssai, de/ka de\\ sto/mat' ei)=en"}, "#text": "Homeri est .

It is\nhowever only of the events preceding the settlement that the poet really treats,of the\nwanderings and the war. In that, as in other things, he follows Homer, who does not\nshow us Ulysses  but leaves him fresh from the slaughter of the suitors, from the first embrace of\nhis wife and father, and from the conquest of his disaffected subjects. Accordingly,\nthe poem divides itself into two parts, the wanderings being embraced by the first, the\nItalian war by the second. But the two parts naturally involve different modes of\ntreatment, comprehending as they do periods of time widely differing in length, the\none seven years, the other apparently a few days. Here again the example of Homer\nis followed. The long period of wanderings is taken at a point not far from its\nconclusion; enough is told in detail to serve as a specimen of the whole, and the rest is\nrelated more summarily by the help of an obvious expedient, the hero being made to\nnarrate his past adventures to the person whose relation to him is all the time forming\none adventure more. This peculiarity of the Homeric story is noticed by Horace in a\nwell-known passage of his Art of Poetry (vv. 146 foll.), and recommended to the\nadoption of Epic writers generally; but he does not clearly indicate the reason of it,\nwhich doubtless is the wish to avoid that fatal dryness which seems to be inseparable\nfrom all narratives where the events of many years are told continuously in a short\ncompass."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Troy", "#text": "Troy"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "perseus,Troy", "#text": "Troy"}], "pb": {"@n": "30"}, "persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Homer"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}], "#text": "The First Book of the Aeneid may be said to perform well the objects which it was no\ndoubt intended to accomplish,those of interesting us in the hero and introducing the\nstory. After a brief statement of the subject, we have a view of the supernatural machinery\nby which it is to be worked out; and this, though imitated from Homer, where\nthe solitary rancour of Poseidon against Ulysses answers to the solitary rancour of Juno\nagainst Aeneas, is skilfully contrived so as to throw a light on the subsequent history\nof the Roman descendants of Aeneas, by the mention, even at that early time, of their\ngreat enemy, Carthage. It is probable, as I have said in the general Introduction to\nthe Aeneid, that the merit of this thought may be due to Naevius, who seems to have\nbeen the first to commit the felicitous anachronism of bringing Aeneas and Dido\ntogether; but it must be allowed to be in strict accordance with the spirit of Virgil's\npoem, which is throughout that of historical anticipation. Like Ulysses, Aeneas is\nshipwrecked in the voyage which was to have been his last, the main difference being\nthat the Grecian hero is solitary, having long since lost all his companions, while the\nTrojan is still accompanied by those who followed his fortunes from . The\nmachinery by which the storm is allayed is perhaps managed more adroitly by Virgil\n\nthan by Homer, as there seems to be more propriety in representing the inferior god of\nthe winds as counteracted by the superior god of the sea, than in making a sea nymph\nrescue one whom the god of the sea is seeking to destroy. But if  has obtained\nan advantage over Homer, it is with the help of Homer's weapons, as the interview\nbetween Juno and Aeolus obviously owes its existence to the interview between Here\nand the God of Sleep. The dialogue of Venus and Jupiter appears to be another appropriation\nfrom Naevius; but, as in the former case,  seems to have established\nhis right to what he has borrowed by the perfect fitness with which a prophecy of the\ndestiny of  is introduced at the commencement of a poem intended to be a\nmonument of Roman greatness. The remaining incidents of the First Book need not\ndetain us much longer. As a general rule, they are borrowed from Homer; but we\nmay admire the skill with which  has introduced varieties of detail, as where\nUlysses, listening to songs about , reappears in Aeneas looking at sculptures or\npaintings of Trojan subjects, and the art with which a new impression is produced by a\ncombination of old materials, in making the friendly power that receives Aeneas unite\nthe blaudishments of Calypso with the hospitality of Alcinous, and so engrafting a tale\nof passion on a narrative of ordinary adventure. The suggestion of the employment of\nCupid by Venus was evidently taken from the loan of Aphrodite's cestus in  and\nthe assistance rendered by the God of Love in Apollonius; but the treatment of the\nthought is original and happy; and the few lines which describe the removal of\nAscanius to Idalia might themselves suggest a subject for poetry to some Keats or\nShelley, in whose mind the seed casually dropped by  should expand and\ngerminate."}]}, {"@type": "commline", "@n": "1-7", "p": {"q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "I sing the hero who founded\nthe Trojan kingdom in Italy, his voyages\nand his wars."}}}, {"@type": "commline", "@n": "1", "p": [{"quote": {"@lang": "la", "l": ["Ille ego, qui quondam gracili modulatus avena", "Carmen et egressus silvis vicina coegi", "Ut quamvis avido parerent arva colono,", "Gratum opus agricolis: at nunc horrentia Martis."]}, "#text": "This line is preceded in some MSS.\nby the following verses,"}, {"quote": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "Si res\nita se habet, acutior sane Varius Vergilio\nfuit."}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Semper equos atque\narma virum pugnasque canebat."}], "emph": ["introduction", "war"], "q": [{"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "arma virumque"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "arma virumque,"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "arma virum,"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "arma"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Troiae qui primus ab oris"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Ille ego qui quondam gracili modulatus\navena"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "arma Martis"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "arma agricolae"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "arma"}], "bibl": [{"@n": "Ov.

We know enough of the others to be assured that the\nmain incidents in Virgil's narrativethe story of the Trojan horse, the introduction of\nSinon, the tragic death of Laocoonare taken from his predecessors. It would have\nbeen unnatural if it had not been so. Custom bound  to follow the legend in its\nmain bearings as he had received it, though it left him quite free, as I have contended\nin the general Introduction to the Aeneid, to vary minor details, and give his own\ncolour to the whole. How far  is original in the minuti of his treatment, we\ncannot tell. Macrobius indeed makes one of his interlocutors (Sat. 5. 2) speak of it as\na fact known to every schoolboy, that the story of this book is taken almost word for\nword from one Pisander, who wrote a mythological history of the world in verse; but\nthough the charge is circumstantially made, it is discredited by the silence of other\n\nauthorities, whose ignorance contrasts strangely with this schoolboy knowledge; and\nHeyne, in his first Excursus to this book, has made it more than probable that the\nplagiarism of the poet is really the blunder of the critic, who is supposed to have confounded\ntwo Pisanders, one who lived before Virgil, but did not write the mythologicohistorical\npoem, and another who did write the poem, but lived after Virgil. The\nlittle that we know from Servius and others about the treatment of the stories of\nLaocoon and Sinon by earlier writers points rather to difference from Virgil's version\nthan to identity with it: and though we must not build so much on this, as it is the\nwont of such witnesses to dwell rather on points of dissimilarity than on points of\nagreement, we may take it as showing that  did really exercise his privilege of\nvarying the smaller circumstances of the narrative, especially as his successors,\nQuinctus Smyrnaeus and Tryphiodorus, who are supposed to have been diligent copyists\nof the early writers, differ from him considerably in their manner of treatment. At\nany rate, whatever may have been Virgil's obligations to his predecessors for the\nincidents of his narrative, we cannot doubt that the golden thread which runs through\nthe whole, the feeling of Aeneas himself, is substantially his own. The steps by which\nthe hero comes to realize his position as an inhabitant of a captured city, a partisan\nof a cause against which the gods have finally declared,steps indicated with such\nsubtlety that it is only of late that they have been fully recognized (see on vv. 322,\n402),are not likely to have been transmitted by legend, while they bear in themselves\nthe strongest marks of the poet's peculiar art."}, {"persName": {"surname": "Virgil"}, "pb": {"@n": "109"}, "quote": {"@lang": "greek", "l": ["w)= ge/ron, e)mmemaw=ta kai\\ e)ssu/meno/n per a)nw/geis:", "ou) ga/r s' e)xqro\\n e)o/nta meta\\ zwoi=sin e)a/sw:", "ou) ga/r ti yuxh=s pe/lei a)ndra/si fi/lteron a)/llo."]}, "#text": "Perhaps there is no better way of estimating the greatness of  in this book\nthan by glancing at the manner in which the subject has been treated by the three\nlater poets, Smyrnaeus, Tryphiodorus, and Tzetzes. With his example before them,\nnot to mention the other writers whom they probably followed, they have yet contrived\nto divest a most stirring and pathetic story of a large part of its interest. Smyrnaeus\nbestows two of his fourteen books, the twelfth and the thirteenth, on the capture of\nTroy. He goes over much the same ground as Virgil; but his narrative is flat and\nlifeless: the incidents do not flow out of each other, and sometimes, instead of incident,\nwe are put off with the tedious generality of a mere historical abridgment. Calchas\nadvises the Greeks to try stratagem rather than force: Ulysses on the moment strikes\nout the notion of the wooden horse with all its details: Neoptolemus and Philoctetes,\nlike Milton's Moloch, are for open war, and attempt to lead their people to battle at\nonce, but are checked by a thunderbolt from Zeus, which quite overawes them; an incident\nbriefly despatched, and apparently introduced for no object whatever. Soon after\nwe hear that the gods are at war with each other, as in the twentieth Iliad, hurling as\nmissiles the hills of Ida; but we are expressly told that while all nature is convulsed,\nthe human combatants are unconscious of what is going on, and even this invisible warfare\nis soon terminated by another thunderbolt from Zeus, so that, as before, we are at\na loss to understand the relevancy of the incident. When the horse is made, Sinon is\nleft with it, having expressed to the Greeks his willingness to undergo burning alive, or\nany torture that the Trojans may inflict. Accordingly, he stands silent while the enemy\nsurrounds him, trying him first with mild words of inquiry, afterwards with the harsher\nmethods of mutilation and burning: and then, having given this undoubted proof of his\ncourage, he voluntarily tells his story. Laocoon, who disbelieves him, is struck blind\non the spot, the state of his eyes being described with a sickening minuteness of detail;\nyet even in this condition he continues urging his countrymen to burn the horse, and\nso the serpents are sent to destroy his children by his side. Cassandra then takes his\n\nplace in denunciation, but is gibed at by the Trojans: she tries herself to burn or break\nopen the horse, but torch and weapons are wrested from her. A paragraph is spent in\nenforcing the statement that the Greeks suffered during the sack as well as the Trojans,\nand the modes of their deaths are enumerated with statistical particularity. Some, we\nare told, were hit by goblets, others by tables, others by torches and spits with meat\nadhering to them, others by hatchets: some have their fingers cut off in trying to ward\noff blows: some are bruised with stones, and some pierced with lances, which the Trojans\nwere able to wield in spite of the wine they had drunk. We are told of Aeneas' escape,\nwhich it appears was owing partly, as in Virgil, to the protection of his mother, who\nwarded off the weapons of the enemy, but partly also to a speech of Calchas to the\nGreeks, ordering them to spare him on account of his signal piety in taking his father\nand son with him rather than his treasure.

Ulysses, as in Smyrnaeus, lays down the programme of operations: the heroes\nrise one after another, as at the challenge of Hector in the seventh book of the Iliad,\nand volunteer in the service; and when they are lodged in the horse, Pallas provides\nthem with ambrosia; immediately after which they are aptly compared to beasts running\ndown a rock to escape a winter torrent, and waiting in their den, famished with\nhunger. Sinon is left, mangled, like Ulysses in Helen's story in the fourth Odyssey,\nwith stripes from his own hand, and tells a similar story to that in Virgil, except that\nhe represents himself as having been scourged by his comrades because he refused to\nfly with them. The dragging of the horse into the city is detailed at tedious length,\nthe agency of the gods, which duly appears later in the poem, being tastelessly anticipated,\nand Here being made to open the gates wider than usual, while Poseidon knocks\ndown part of the stonework of the entrance. Cassandra protests, as in Smyrnaeus, and\nis severely upbraided by her father, who sends her to her chamber. Helen's story in\nHomer is again put under requisition, and the adulteress is made to address the Greeks\nwithin the horse in the tones of their respective wives; but the incident is an isolated\none, and no attempt is made to harmonize it with the rest of the story. For the rest of\nthe book the narrative proceeds more rapidly, the different events of the sack being\ndespatched each in a few lines, without any attempt at pictorial narrative. The poet\ncannot, he says, tell all that happened on that night; that is a business for the Muses:\nhe feels himself to be a chariot-driver nearing the goal. Tzetzes need hardly detain us\na moment, as his narrative of the sack of  is utterly contemptible, with no pretension\nto poetry, and very little to style or metre.

The time embraced by the present narrative is\nnot much shorter than that comprehended by its prototype: indeed, it is considerably\nlonger, as of Ulysses' ten years seven are spent with Calypso, and of these we have no\nrecord: but  felt that the second narrator must be briefer than the first, and\naccordingly contracted his story into a single book. To a certain extent it was almost\nnecessary that there should be a coincidence in the details of the two accounts as well\nas in the original plan. The mythical geography of  had become part of the\nepic commonplace, though, like the mythical history, it was modified freely, not followed\nservilely: and as Aeneas was wandering in the same parts as Ulysses, and at the\nsame time, it would have been unnatural to make their experiences altogether independent\nand dissimilar. Yet the only place in which the two lines of adventure actually\ntouch is when they enter the country of the Cyclops: and there  has skilfully\ncontrived not to rival Homer's story, but to appropriate it, and to make Aeneas\nreap the fruit of Ulysses' experience without being obliged to repeat it in his own person.\nFor his other incidents he is indebted partly to other portions of the body of\nheroic legend, partly to his own invention. Polydorus is from the Greek drama; the\nbleeding myrtle however may be Virgil's own, though Heyne, with a judicial \ngives the credit of it to the Cyclic poets: the adventure with the Harpies was\nsuggested by Apollonius, who also, as we have seen in the general Introduction, gave\nhints for the predictions of Helenus and the deliverance of Achemenides: other legends,\nnoticed in Heyne's first Excursus, seem to have given the outline of the voyage, indicating\nthe several places touched at. The mistakes made in searching for the new\nkingdom, the scene at Delos, the appearance of the Penates, the meeting with Andromache,\nseem all to be more or less original. Segrais notes that the interest of the book\nhas suffered from its position between two of the noblest portions of the poem: and\nHeyne observes that it is not generally appreciated because the reader does not possess\nadequate knowledge of the minute particulars of legendary history, geography, and\nantiquities which the poet has indicated by transient and remote allusions."}, {"persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}], "placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Troy", "#text": "Troy"}, "pb": {"@n": "192"}, "q": {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "vertitur,"}, "#text": "Heyne has been at the pains to distinguish the seven years over which  distributes\nhis hero's wanderings. , according to the almost universal tradition, was\ntaken in the summer.

In particular, can we safely assume that the books of\nthe Aeneid were all composed in the order in which they now stand? This last question\nhas been pressed home forcibly by a German scholar, Conrads, in a short treatise\ncalled  which appeared at Treves in .

A difficulty\nhas always been felt about Creusa's mention of Hesperia, Book 2. 781, as contrasted\nwith Aeneas' ignorance on the subject during the early part of his wanderings: the\nprophecy of Celaeno is in effect another version of the prophecy of Anchises (Book 7.\n124 foll.), with which it is scarcely reconcilable: and the predictions of Helenus about\nthe white sow and the information to be received from the Sibyl are either inconsistent\nwith or unaccountably independent of what actually happens in the course of the\nstory.

These are all\npoints which appear to belong to the sphere of Virgilian criticism in general, whether\naesthetic or antiquarian; and it seemed natural to discuss them in that connexion. For\nthe questions then of Aeneas' treatment of Dido, of Virgil's obligations to Apollonius\nRhodius, and of his relations, general and special, to the Greek drama, I must refer\nmy readers to what I have said already.", {"persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}], "placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, "pb": {"@n": "259"}, "#text": "Naevius, as has been remarked in the general Introduction, is supposed to have\npreceded  in the anachronism of bringing Aeneas and Dido together. As\nthis fact is itself a matter of inference, we cannot of course tell whether he made their\nparting tragical or otherwise. All that we know connecting Naevius with the story\nof this book is that he mentioned Anna, Dido's sister, who appears now in  for\nthe first time. How this personage came to be complicated with the legendary history\nof  is not clear; her name however, which is Carthaginian, like Hanno, Hannibal,\n&c., led to her identification with Anna Perenna, the Roman goddess of the year,\nand Ovid (Fasti, 3. 523 foll.) recounts or invents a story of her following Aeneas to\nItaly. In  she is merely the confidante of the heroine, a character which has\nbecome a stock one at certain periods of the history of the drama, especially since the\nchorus came to be excluded from the action. In other respects  would seem\nsimply to have taken the traditional story of Dido, and modified it as was required by\nthe necessity of blending her destiny with that of Aeneas. According to the most\ndetailed accounts, as epitomized in the Dictionary of Biography, Dido's early history\nup to the time of her landing in Africa coincides substantially with that narrated by\nVenus to Aeneas in Book 1; afterwards she is persecuted by her neighbour, King\nIarbas, who demands her hand; she resolves to avoid him by death, erects a funeral\npile under the pretence of a sacrifice to propitiate her former husband, and kills herself\nthere.  turns the loveless queen into a passionate lover, keeping however the\ngroundwork of the character, devotion to the memory of her murdered lord, which is\n\nonly overcome by Venus' express agency, and even then from time to time struggles\nand resists. Iarbas is naturally made to recede into the distance; his anger contributes\nto darken the prospect of Dido's desolation, but is in no sense the motive cause of her\ndeath. The mode of her death is borrowed from the traditional story, and the fact of\nher resorting to a pretext to conceal her purpose; but as the reason for her death is\ndifferent, the pretext is different also.

There is the same variety\nin the MSS. in Pers. Prol. 5.  is\nmore plausible, as the \nmay be well said with Henry to answer to\n v. 429, the grace of\na brief delay. But Henry has forgotten\nthat it may answer equally well to  v. 420,\nthe favour which Dido begs of her sister,\nof carrying this message to Aeneas: and it\ncannot be denied that \nis strongly in favour of so interpreting it,\nthough the words might mean There is then no overpowering\n reason for adopting\n nor do the interpretations proposed\nby its supporters supply any additional\nargument in its favour. If indeed\nwe might read with the Delphin\neditor  we should obtain\na clear and intelligible sense I do not know why Wagn.\ncalls this  the objection which\noccurs at first sight, that Dido would thus\nspeak too plainly of a resolution which she\nafterwards takes such pains to conceal\nfrom her sister, is, as we shall see, not\nconvincing: the expression would, I think,\nstrike any one as sufficiently natural and\nunforced, if the reading were undoubted;\nand the strongest improbability in the\ncase is the general one founded on the\nalmost invariable trustworthiness of one\nor other of Virg.'s MSS. Henry's interpretation\nadopts not only  but\n understanding Dido to say\nthat if Aeneas grants her the favour of a\nlittle delay, she, though brought lower\nthan the grave ( = in\naggravated death, in a state worse than\ndeath), will abate her passion. The intransitive\nsense of  is possible\nenough: but the interpretation of  is absolutely impossible, and\nnot justified by a less forced expression in\na more forced writer, Statius, who in Theb.\n11. 582 speaks of Oedipus' blindness as\n On the whole, the\nchief value of  seems to be that\nit has given occasion for a very ingenious\nconjecture of Schrader, \nwhich would suit  the sense\nproduced being \nAccepting the ordinary reading\nas having the authority of Serv., we shall\nnot find much difficulty in giving \nthe sense of  though\nit does not seem to have been generally\nused as its conventional equivalent (comp.\nHor. A. P. 349, ), while \nwill naturally mean  as in Livy 2. 23,   may be\neither the abl. instr. with \nor used as in v. 502 below,  Here again the difficulty is in the\n\ngeneral sense. Roughly considered, the\nmeaning seems to be that Dido's death\nwill bring to Anna a return for her kindness;\nbut it is not easy to see what the\nreturn can be, and so to determine whether\nthe death is to be the cause of its\nbeing made or merely the occasion.\nWagn.'s notion that Dido hints that she\nwill bequeath her kingdom to Anna is\nunworthy of the occasion, and not supported\nby any thing else in this book,\nwhile it has not even the justification of\nconsistency with the legend, which makes\nAnna after her sister's death migrate into\nItaly. Perhaps we may say, borrowing a\nhint from Serv., that Dido's language is\nintentionally obscure, her meaning being\nthat her return for Anna's kindness will\nbe that she will kill herself, and so rid\nher sister of the burden. Anna would\ntake the words as a mere expression of\ndesperation, their very obscurity preventing\nher from attaching too much meaning\nto them. So her language in v. 419 is\nworded in a manner which might have\nled any one already on the watch to infer\nthe worst, while an unsuspecting person\nlike Anna would take it in a good sense,\nknowing moreover, as Virg. reminds us v.\n502, that Dido had once before endured\nsuccessfully what seemed even a worse\nsorrow. Generally we may say that while\nDido's purpose is still undecided, she does\nnot shrink from speaking of death, though\nher words are little more than those of\nvague desperation. It is only when she has\nseen death to be her only course that she\nis anxious that no one should suspect what\nshe is meditating. Sophocles has represented\njust the same change of feeling in\nAjax, who talks wildly of death on his\nfirst recovery from his frenzy, but afterwards,\nwhen he is quite resolved to die,\ncontrives an elaborate blind for Tecmessa\nand the Chorus. Thus that Dido should\nspeak of death here is no more than we\nshould expect, though the precise import\nof her words may be left undetermined.\nRibbeck, adopting  reads  apparently from his own conjecture.\nThe old editors placed the comma\nafter  not after \nWith the parenthetical \ncomp.  v. 478, which may\nbe meant as a contrast to it.  of\na favour.

But it is quite\nin keeping with Virg.'s literary tastes that\nhe should interest himself more in the\ndramatic persons that he had seen or read\nof than in their supposed prototypes.\nSuch a feeling, it is true, is not the simple\nfeeling of an old poet: to conceive of any\nthing of the kind in  would involve\na grotesque impossibility. But the comparison\nof one mythical person to another\nis equally foreign to Homer. His similes\nare limited in their range: heroes and their\nactions are paralleled to the more ordinary\noccupations of life, to inferior creatures or\nnatural phenomena. He does not tell us\nthat Achilles resented the abduction of\nBriseis as Meleager did the slight offered\nto Atalanta. Virg. must be judged by\nhis own standard; and there is nothing\n\ninconsistent with that standard in supposing\nthat the Pentheus of his thoughts\nwas the Pentheus of Euripides, the Orestes\nof Aeschylus.

There is indeed no part of the\nwork which more completely exemplifies the characteristics of  as a poetical\nartist. He appears not only to reproduce Homer, but to absorb him. Aeneas sees all,\nor nearly all, that Ulysses sees, his parent, his friends, his enemies, and the heroes\nand heroines of previous legend: but he sees much more besides. The bare and\nshadowy outlines of the Homeric  are filled in with details unquestionably elaborate\nand apparently precise. Instead of a place of simply ghostly existence, where\nsuffering and doing seem to be the exceptions, and dreary, objectless being the rule, we\nhave a territory mapped out and sharply divided; a neutral region for those who are\nunfortunate rather than blameworthy, a barred and bolted prison-house of torture for\nthe bad, a heroic Valhalla for prowess, genius, and worth. All that later Greek religion\nand philosophy taught by legend, allegory, and symbol is pressed into the service of\npoetry, and made to contribute to the production of a grand and impressive picture.\nAs a climax to the whole, the Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration is invoked for\nthe purpose of showing Aeneas the vision of the future, as he has already seen the\nvision of the past. He beholds the spirits that are to appear in each as actors in the\ngreat drama of Roman history, each even now wearing his historical form: and the\nline of worthies ends with the young hope of the nation, whose untimely death was still\nfresh in the memory of his countrymen when the poet wrote."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "1", "#text": "Homeric Studies, vol. iii. p. 515."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "@n": "2", "date": {"@value": "1721", "#text": "1721"}, "#text": "Works, vol. ii. p. 300, quarto edition,  (cited by Warburton)."}], "quote": {"persName": {"surname": "Virgil"}, "#text": "the Inferno\nof  has no consistent or veracious relation to any idea of the future or unseen\nstate actually operative among mankind."}, "persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}], "pb": {"@n": "424"}, "seg": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "Misenus above"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "heroes in Elysium"}], "q": [{"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "bello clari."}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "The pale spectre of Adrastus"}], "placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Troy", "#text": "Troy"}, "#text": "Yet, if we approach this wonderful production in detail, we meet with much that\nappears to us not only unaccountable or presumably wrong, but demonstrably inconsistent\nor confused. It is not merely, as Mr. Gladstone complains, that  To what extent this charge is true is, as\nwe shall see, a difficult question; but admitting it not to be wholly groundless, we may\nurge that a mythological poem of the Augustan age could not have the same relation\nto the real beliefs or anticipations of its readers as the Odyssey, with its absence of\nphilosophy and its comparative uniformity of legend. The defects I allude to are such\nas vitiate not so much the spirit of the work as that about which  is generally\nmore careful, the external structure. Some of these indeed are merely of the nature\n\nof those which we have already encountered in earlier parts of the poem. In the opening\nof the book, while we admire the description of the temple of Cumae and the\nravings of the Sibyl, and confess that  has there taken full and worthy advantage\nof a supposed form of the supernatural which in Homer's time was only in its\ninfancy, we must yet feel the awkwardness with which the Homeric Elpenor is introduced\nfirst as  ground, then as Palinurus below, when a single drowned\nfriend would have been sufficient both to delay Aeneas' descent and to meet him on\nthe threshold of the shades. So again it is not clear whether it is to rapidity and\nindirectness of narrative or to carelessness that we are to impute the apparent inconsistency\nbetween the intimations that these rivers, one of them ninefold, had to be\npassed by any one wishing to penetrate into the infernal world, and the circumstantial\ndetail which would lead us to suppose that Aeneas only crossed one, and that only once.\nBut the inconsistency of treatment becomes more serious as we advance farther into\nthe book. The lower world, as was said just now, is divided by  into a neutral\nregion, a place of torment, and a place of happiness. The two latter present no difficulty:\nthe conception of the former is not so satisfactory. The general notion seems\nto be that it is the receptacle of those who, not having fulfilled their natural time of\nlife, cannot be pronounced good or bad. This is Addison's view, and it appears to\nsatisfy the requirements of the passage as well as any that can be suggested: but it\ndoes not show the poet to have formed a consistent conception. Indeed,  himself\nmay be said to point out to us an incongruity in the picture he has drawn, when he\nintroduces the class of persons who have suffered death by unjust sentences. We are\nready at once to ask whether it is not the business of the tribunal of the other world\nto rectify the inequality of earthly judgments: and lest the thought should not occur\nto us,  suggests it himself by telling us that the cases of these misjudged sufferers\nare reheard below. The natural conclusion would be that, after this rehearing, the\nspirits, now truly judged, are sent to Tartarus or Elysium: but of this not a word is\nsaid, and we are left to suppose that they remain in the dubious limbo where we\nfirst find them. But the doubt, once raised, extends farther, and we ask whether the\ninfallible Minos could not pronounce on the real character of all who have been\nprematurely cut off. A further question arises as to the nature of premature death.\nTartarus, as afterwards described, contains many who have died before their time by\nthe visitation of heaven. Is it intended that the Mourning Fields should contain all\nwho have suffered by human vengeance? Eriphyle is there; would  have ventured\nto introduce Clytaemnestra? Again, what is to be said of the heroes, who\noccupy the extreme part of this neutral region? It is not expressly stated that they\ndied in war: we merely hear of them as  \nhappens to be the spirit of the only one of the Seven against Thebes who survived the\nexpedition. But even if we suppose that Virgil's general conception is that of slain\nwarriors, can we say that he is consistent with himself in placing slain warriors in a\ncondition neither of torment nor of happiness? There are ; there\nare those who suffered wounds in battle for their country. But among the heroes in\nthe neutral region there are found not only the assailants of , but its defenders.\nWas theirs not a patriotic cause? or are we to distinguish those who were merely\nwounded from those who were killed, and say that the former earned Elysium by their\nsubsequent lives?"}, {"pb": {"@n": "425"}, "seg": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "Deiphobus, Salmoneus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "later ages"}], "persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}], "q": [{"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "true shades."}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "true shades,"}, {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "false dreams,"}], "#text": "Such are some of the questions that may be raised about the earlier part of this\nBook. But they are as nothing to the grand difficulty which the poet has chosen to\ncreate by his philosophy of transmigration. The doctrine is a sublime one, and well\n\nadapted for poetry: but it is quite incompatible with the conception that pervades the\nrest of the description of the lower world. The neutral region, Tartarus, and Elysium,\nall dissolve before it. They exist on the assumption that departed spirits remain in a fixed\nstate, each preserving its own individuality. The later doctrine takes all spirits alike as\nsoon as they have been separated from the body, puts them through a thousand years'\npurgation, and then sends most of them to reanimate other frames. We hear not of\ngood or bad lives, but of the necessary stains which the ethereal spirit contracts from its\nimprisonment in clay. According to this doctrine, Dido and  and\nthe Lapithae, ought to have undergone a prolonged purification, with a prospect of\nresigning their identity and becoming other personages in . Some indeed, of\nwhom Anchises is the type, are apparently exempted from this general law, and made\nto inhabit Elysium immediately after their expiation: but the exemption seems to\nproceed from a different feeling from that which established the law, and at any rate\nit leaves the great majority of spirits involved in the migratory cycle. There is inconsistency\nalso in the manner in which the picture of the migration is presented.\nWhile  is expounding his doctrine he is clear: when he comes to paint it in its\nresults he becomes confused. The spirits that are to be Romans are spirits that have\ninhabited other bodies. Why do we hear every thing about their future, nothing about\ntheir past? It may be said that they have drunk Lethe and left the past behind.\nThis may hold good of Silvius and one or two others who are just on the threshold of a\nnew life on earth: but does it accord with the presumable condition of the later Roman\nworthies, such as Augustus himself? They have had their thousand years of purgation:\nhow are they to spend the remaining thousand years before they become living\nmen? And what is to be the condition of Silvius and the earlier posterity of Aeneas\nafter they have fulfilled their new term on earth? Will they reappear in successive\ngenerations as later Romans? These are inquiries which the Pythagorean doctrine\nsuggests, and which, if treated in an independent manner, and not brought into connexion\nwith beliefs with which it has nothing to do, it might perhaps have answered.\nAfter this, it is comparatively unimportant to notice the difficulty which many critics\nhave felt about the two gates of sleep, their want of congruity with the topography of\nthe rest of the book, and the absence of any reason why Aeneas and the Sibyl should\nbe dismissed by the ivory gate. This last question is answered, though with some\nhesitation, by Gibbon and Heyne, who remark that corporeal visitants could not be\ndismissed by the horn gate, not being  The reply is obvious, that if they\nare not  neither are they  and that the inappropriateness of\none mode of exit does not prove the appropriateness of the other, or excuse  for\nhaving created so inopportune an alternative."}, {"persName": [{"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Homer"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}, {"surname": "Virgil"}], "pb": [{"@n": "426"}, {"@n": "427"}], "quote": ["a theatrical representation of all\nthat was believed or imagined of the lower world, it is not surprising that the copy.\nwas like the original:", {"persName": {"surname": "Virgil"}, "#text": "it still remains undetermined whether  intended\nto describe the original or the copy."}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "palma auro subtiliter foliata,"}], "seg": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Plato differs"}, "#text": "I must not conclude without saying a few words on Warburton's once celebrated\nhypothesis, that Aeneas' descent into the shades is an allegorical description of his\ninitiation into the mysteries, a process which, it is contended, in pursuance of the\nargument of the Divine Legation, was part of the training of every heathen legislator,\nsuch as Aeneas is assumed to be. That hypothesis was controverted, as is well known,\nin a characteristic essay by Gibbon, who was probably repelled not more by the\narrogant dogmatism of the untrained scholar than by the zeal of the ecclesiastic in\nproving that even pagan times witnessed to the alliance between religion and civil\ngovernment. A reader of the present day will, I think, be induced to award the\npalm of learning and ingenuity to Warburton. He deals indeed largely in unproved\nassumptions, which his skilful adversary is not slow to expose; but he has succeeded in\ninvesting his theory with considerable plausibility, suggesting by its help explanations\nof points in Virgil's narrative which it is not easy to clear up otherwise. The theory\nin its totality is sufficiently alien from the spirit of modern criticism. No one who\nregards  as my readers have, I trust, seen reason to regard him, will suspect him\n\nof intending an elaborate and sustained allegory in this book any more than in the\nwhole poem. Aeneas is not an anticipation of Augustus, and the descent into the\nshades is not simply a poetical account of initiation. But Aeneas has many Augustan\ntraits, and it is quite possible that several of Virgil's details, as Heyne admits, if not\nhis general conception, may have been drawn from the mysteries. Gibbon is satisfied\nto argue that the mysteries being admitted to be  but that  This argument really proceeds on an assumption\nas unwarranted as any of Warburton's, that there was a recognized doctrine on the\nsubject which the mysteries copied faithfully in detail. As a matter of fact, no such\nauthorized description of the state of the dead can be shown to have existed. Classical\ndictionaries have to compound their accounts of the state of belief on these question\nout of many different and indeed discordant materials.  says one thing, Pindar\nanother;  from them both, even when speaking, like them, the language\nof fable, and the mythe in one of his dialogues differs from the mythe in another.\nThe representation in the mysteries differs circumstantially from other mythical representations\nthat have come down to us; and the question is whether  may not\nhave described the original after the manner of this particular copy. There is some\nreason to suspect that in certain instances this was actually the case. Virgil's Elysium,\nas Warburton has pointed out, is like that sketched by Aristophanes in the Frogs, and\nexpressly identified by him with the happy state of the initiated. The inexplicable\ngolden bough perhaps receives more light from the \nwhich was carried in the mysteries of Isis, than from any other parallel that has been\nadduced. Nay, we may even believe with Warburton that in describing the descent\nof Aeneas  may have thought of the initiation of Augustus, and that here as\nelsewhere, while adopting an incident from Homer, the poet may have had ulterior\npurposes of his own. The supposition is shadowy and conjectural; but the thought in\nitself is one which might not unnaturally have found place in that assemblage of\nantiquarian recollections, philosophical fancies, patriotic feelings, and courtly sentiments\nwhich acted as the motive power on Virgil's imagination. Gibbon objects that Aeneas\nis no legislator: but though he performs no acts of legislation in the Aeneid, his spirit\nis legislatorial throughout: he is the repository of traditions which are to be handed\ndown to his posterity, and his destiny, as declared by Jupiter, is to found institutions\nas well as walls. Nor need we be concerned to defend  from the charge of\nhaving made disclosures which would have led Horace to renounce his friendship.\nWarburton's thoroughgoing adherence to his theory obliged him to suppose that the\npoet of the Aeneid had actually been initiated, a supposition which Gibbon rightly\nrejects as resting on no evidence, and contradicted by the accounts of Virgil's biographer.\nBut the circumstances connected with initiation were one thing, and the\ngrand secret itself another: and while the latter has been so successfully preserved as\nto have perished with its depositaries, the former meet us openly in ancient literature,\nin allusion or in detail, so that we may be sure that they were perfectly at the service\nof any uninitiated poet who chose to avail himself of them to garnish and authenticate\nhis narrative."}]}, {"@type": "commline", "@n": "1-8", "p": {"q": {"@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Aeneas lands at Cumae, and his\ncrew prepare for a meal."}}}, {"@type": "commline", "@n": "1", "p": {"q": [{"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Sic fatur lacrimans"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Classi inmittit habenas"}], "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "w(\\s fa/to dakruxe/wn"}, "quote": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "Ipsa videbatur ventis regina vocatis\nVela dare, et laxos iam iamque inmittere\nfunis."}, {"bibl": {"@n": "Lucr. 5.787", "#text": "Lucr. 5.787"}, "q": [{"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "habenae"}, {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "rudentes"}], "#text": "This is the ordinary\nmetaphor (as A. 5. 662, , Ov.\nM. 1. 280), but is here peculiarly appropriate,\nthe  of a ship being its\n (sheets), which required to be\nlet loose or slacked in order to allow the\nsails to be filled with the wind and the\nressel to go at full speed."}], "#text": "On this and the next line see note at\nthe end of Book 5. \nis Hom.'s  (Il. 1. 357).\n means that he\nspread his sails to the wind.

That they\nshould endure this is not unjust: the\niniquity which dismissed them from life\ndoes not make their lives good or bad;\nthat is decided by Minos, as we shall see\nimmediately. We should expect however\nthat they would not occupy this place permanently,\nbut that on the rehearing of\ntheir case some would be despatched to\nTartarus, others to Elysium. But Virg.\ndoes not say this, and if we compare the\ncase of these persons with those of the\n\ninfants and the suicides, we may doubt\nwhether he intended it. Infants remain\nin their limbo apparently because they\nhave had no opportunity of showing whether\nthey were worthy of Elysium or of\nTartarus; those who have cut short their\nown lives are not to be credited with the\ngood or evil of their lives, but are consigned\nat once and for ever to a twilight\ncondition like that imagined by Hom.:\nand so perhaps the victims of unjust sentences\nmay be dealt with as those who\nhaving accidentally come into the state of\ndeath are exempted alike from reward and\npunishment. But we must not probe Virg.'s\nmeaning too deeply: he has deserted the\nsimplicity of Hom. for something far\nmore complicated, and it is not surprising\nthat in borrowing details from other sources\nhe should have been led occasionally to combine\ninconsistencies. Warburton thought\nthe reference here was to a story in Plato's\nGorgias, pp. 523 foll., where the establishment\nof infernal judges is said to have been\nowing to the inequality of the sentences\noriginally passed by living judges who had\nto decide the condition after death of those\nwho were still in the body.

It is true that\nthere is a distinct instance where \nappears to be used for spiritual punishment,\nStat. Theb. 8. 84,  but this proves no more\nthan that Stat. there as elsewhere ventured\non an experiment in language in imitation,\nas he thought, of Virg. Professor Munro,\nJournal of Philology, vol. 2, pp. 145, 146\nsays,  The difficulty of what\nfollows is greater. The words are easy,\nbut it is not easy to see the appropriateness\nof the sentence to the context. As\nthey stand, they appear to speak of a second\npurgation as going on in Elysium,\nwhich is in itself not a very likely thing,\nwhile the change of person from \nand  to  v. 750\nhas still to be accounted for. Jahn, whose\n\nexplanation is approved by Forb., supposes\nthat all the shades are sent into Elysium\nafter their purgation, but that while the\ngreater part only pass through on their\nway to Lethe, a few, of whom Anchises is\none, are allowed to remain there and complete\na still higher purification, as a prelude\nto a new and glorious life on earth.\nThis is probably as plausible an explanation\nas is likely to be suggested of the passage\nas it stands, but the inconsistencies of it\nlie on the surface. Elysium, as has been\nsaid above, is not a natural place for purgation;\nit is evidently the everlasting\nreward of a good life, not a place of temporary\nsojourn previous to a return to\nearth: there is nothing in vv. 741, 742, as\ncompared with vv. 745747, to show that\nthe degree of purification contemplated in\nthe latter is intended to be higher than\nthat in the former: the  of v.\n748 are plainly parallel to the \nof v. 745; and it can hardly be meant\nthat the more highly purified spirits return\nto earth without a draught of Lethe. A\ngeneral view of the context seems to require,\nas Heyne and some of the early\neditors, and more lately Henry, have seen,\nthat the souls which are purified and sent\nback to earth should be distinguished from\nthe select few who are purified and established\nin Elysium, and this the change of\nperson decidedly favours. The words\n then, if not the previous\nclause, will refer to the latter, the\nwhole of the following lines to the former,\nwho, as being far the larger number, are\nspoken of as if they were the whole body.\nBut this sense, though required by the\ncontext and favoured by the language,\ndoes not suit the order of the passage.\nHeyne and his contemporaries wished to\nget rid of the difficulty by transposing the\ntwo lines before us, which is Ribbeck's\nremedy; Henry thinks they are no more\nthan an ordinary Virgilian parenthesis.\nThe first suggestion appears to me as\nmuch too violent as the second is too\nlenient. The supposition of a confusion of\nthe order introduced by the transcribers\nis at all times hazardous (see on \n205), and is exposed to unusual suspicion\nhere, as the lines would still look awkward\nif placed, where alone they could be placed,\nafter v. 747, so that Heyne inclines to\ntreat them as altogether spurious; while\non the other hand, if Virg. intended no\nmore than an ordinary parenthesis, it\nmust be admitted that his sentence is exceedingly\nill constructed. I think then\nthat every thing points to the supposition,\nwhich at one time occurred to Heyne himself,\nthat we have here one of the passages\nin the Aeneid (the case of the Georgics is\ndifferent: see on 205) which\nVirg. left unfinished. His whole conception\nof a metempsychosis seems, as I have\nsaid in the prefatory remarks to this book,\nto be really inconsistent with the general\npicture which he gives of the world of\nspirits, and so he naturally found a difficulty\nin harmonizing the two in Anchises'\nnarrative. Had the Aeneid been a\nfinished poem, the obstacle would doubtless\nhave been surmounted so far as\nthe mechanical structure of the present\npassage is concerned, but we should have\nfelt it nevertheless in reading the Sixth\nBook. A doubt still remains whether\n refers to the whole body of the\ndeparted, as  evidently does, or\nto the few spoken of in the next clause.\nIn the one case the meaning will be that\nthe whole multitude is sent through Elysium,\nthe greater part to drink the Lethe\nwater and then return to life, the few to remain\nin Elysium: in the other, that the few\nare distributed among the spacious plains,\na use of  for which see on 1. 680.\nOn the whole the former view seems to\nagree best with the language of these two\nlines, while any objection which may be\nraised to it from the language of vv. 748\nfoll., where Lethe seems to be introduced\nfor the first time, is obviated by the\nconsideration mentioned above, that the\npresent passage as left by Virg. is not\nmeant to cohere with the context.  like \n1. 538."}}, {"@type": "commline", "@n": "745", "p": {"quote": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "Longa dies"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "longa diei infinita aetas."}], "bibl": {"@n": "Lucr. 1.557", "#text": "Lucr. 1.557"}, "q": {"@lang": "la", "@direct": "unspecified", "#text": "Perfecto temporis orbe"}, "#text": "5. 783.

In the latter kingdom\nSilvius eventually succeeded Ascanius,\neither in default of heirs, or because the\nactual heir, named Iulus, was too young.\nSome made Silvius the son of Ascanius,\nand so Livy 1. 4, who speaks of him as\n Virg. apparently\nadopts the tradition generally,\nwithout thinking it necessary to specify\nthe circumstances of Silvius' birth in the\nwoods, while he indirectly contradicts the\nstory of Lavinia's fear of Ascanius, which\nwould have jarred on all readers of the\nAeneid, by representing Silvius as born in\nhis father's lifetime. The legends of the\nsequel of Aeneas' life after his settlement\nin Latium are not altogether reconcilable\nwith the treatment adopted by Virg. in\nthe Aeneid. Virg. doubtless could have\nharmonized them with his purpose, had\nhe pleased, as skilfully as he has harmonized\ndiscordant materials in the story of\nthe Aeneid itself: but he has chosen instead\nto regard them from a distance,\nwithout distinctly committing himself to\nany one version of them. Even thus however\nhe has not been able to escape some\ninconsistencies, as the present passage\nshows, compared with that in the First\nBook. There (1. 265 foll.) we are told by\nimplication that Aeneas' death and deification\ntakes place three years after his landing\nin Latium: here he is spoken of as\nliving to old age, a time which must have\nbeen conceived of by Virg. as long subsequent\nto that in which he captivated\nDido: there the name of Ascanius is associated\nwith Alba, here that of Silvius.\nThese statements, it is true, may be\nbrought into agreement by supposing that\nAeneas reigns at Lavinium after the expiration\nof three years in camp, Ascanius\nremoving to Alba after his death, and that\nSilvius is mentioned here simply as the\nsuccessor of ; but it\nseems hardly likely that Virg. should have\nformed a definite and, in one respect at\nleast, independent conception of events\nwhich he alludes to so cursorily.

In the first of these passages Phemius is represented as playing\non the phorminx, and (it would seem) singing the story of Ares and Aphrodite as an\naccompaniment to the dancing of the Phaeacian youth. In the second passage we are\ntold that one of the pictures on the shield of Achilles represented a chorus dancing,\n\nIn those cases the chorus is not expressly said to be one of singers: but in the procession\nof grape-gatherers on the same shield (vv. 561572) the troop moved along  (), while a boy played the phorminx and\nsang the Linus to its accompaniment (if that is the true meaning of ). So according to the Hymn to the Pythian Apollo (H. Apoll. 514 ff.) the god himself\nled the way bearing the phorminx, while the Cretans followed and sang a Cretan\npaean: and in  plays on the phorminx, and the Muses sing in turn\n(Il. 1. 604). In all these cases there is a single musician whose instrument regulates\nand accompanies the chorus: but whether he sings himself, and whether the chorus\nsings as well as dances, is not always clear. The practice may have varied with the\ncharacter of the performance, as the epic or lyric element predominated. In the\nLament for Hector (Il. 24. 720776) there are singers who  but\nnothing is said of instruments: Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen recite in turn their\npraises of the dead man, and the rest bewail in chorus.
