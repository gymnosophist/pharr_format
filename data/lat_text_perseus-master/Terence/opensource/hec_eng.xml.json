In the struggle he takes\n                        a ring from her, which he gives to Bacchis. Some time afterward, at his\n                        father's express desire, he consents to marry. By chance the young woman\n                        whom he has ravished is given to him as a wife, to the great joy of her\n                        mother, who alone is aware of her misfortune, and hopes that her disgrace\n                        may be thereby concealed. It, however, happens otherwise ; for Pamphilus,\n                        still retaining his passion for Bacchis, refuses for some time to cohabit\n                        with her. Bacchis, however, now rejects the advances of Pamphilus, who by\n                        degrees becomes weaned from his affection for her, and grows attached to his\n                        wife, whom he has hitherto disliked. Meantime, however, he is suddenly\n                        called away from home. During his absence, Philumena, finding herself\n                        pregnant, in consequence of her misfortune before her marriage, fearing\n                        detection, especially avoids the company of her mother-in-law. At length she\n                        makes an excuse for returning to the home of her own parents, where she\n                        remains. Sostrata thereupon sends for her, but is answered that she is ill,\n                        on which she goes to see her, but is refused admittance to the house. On\n                        hearing of this, Laches blames his wife as being the cause of this\n                        estrangement. Pamphilus now returns, and it so happens that, on the day of\n                        his arrival, Philumena is brought to bed of a child. Impatient to see her,\n                        Pamphilus rushes into her room, and to his great distress finds that this is\n                        the case. Myrrhina thereupon entreats him to keep the matter secret, and\n                        begs him, if he refuses to receive her daughter back again, at least not to\n                        ruin her reputation by divulging it. As he now declines either to take back\n                        his wife or give his reason for so doing, Laches suspects that he is still\n                        enamored of Bacchis, and accordingly sends for her, and expostulates with\n                        her. She, however, exonerates herself; on which the old man, supposing that\n                        Philumena and her mother are equally ignorant with himself as to his son's\n                        motives, begs her to call on them and remove their suspicions.

Among them, as\n                            to those of Caecilius, which I first studied when new; in some of\n                            which I was rejected; in some I kept my ground with difficulty. As I\n                            knew that the fortune of the stage was varying, where the hopes were\n                            uncertain, I submitted to certain toil. Those I zealously attempted to\n                            perform, that from the same writer I might learn new ones, and not\n                            discourage him from his pursuits. I caused them to be represented. When\n                            seen, they pleased. Thus did I restore the Poet to his place, who was\n                            now almost weaned, through the malevolence of his adversaries, from his\n                            pursuits and labors, and from the dramatic art. But if I had at that\n                            period slighted the writer, and had wished to use my endeavors in\n                            discouraging him, so that he might live a life of idleness rather than\n                            of study, I might have easily discouraged him from writing others. Now,\n                            for my sake, hear with unbiased minds what it is I ask. I again bring\n                            before you the Hecyra, which I have never been allowed to act before you\n                            in silence; such misfortunes have so overwhelmed it. These misfortunes\n                            your intelligence will allay, if it is a seconder of our exertions. The\n                            first time, when I began to act this Play, the vauntings of\n                                boxers, the expectation of a\n                                rope-dancer, added to\n                            which, the throng of followers, the noise, the clamor of the women,\n                            caused me to retire from your presence before the time. In this new\n                            Play, I attempted to follow the old custom of mine, of making a fresh trial; I\n                            brought it on again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the mean time a\n                            rumor spread that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace\n                            flock together, make a tumult, clamor aloud, and fight for their\n                                places: meantime, I was\n                            unable to maintain my place. Now there is no confusion: there is\n                            attention and silence--an opportunity of acting my Play has been granted\n                            me; to yourselves is given the power of gracing the scenic\n                                festival. Do not permit, through your\n                            agency, the dramatic art to sink into the hands of a few; let your\n                            authority prove a seconder and assistant to my own. If I have never\n                            covetously set a price upon my skill, and have come to this conclusion,\n                            that it is the greatest gain in the highest possible degree to\n                            contribute to your entertainment; allow me to obtain this of you, that\n                            him who has intrusted his labors to my protection, and himself to your\n                            integrity,--that him, I say, the malicious may not maliciously deride,\n                            beset by them on every side. For my sake, admit of this plea, and attend\n                            in silence, that he may be encouraged to write other Plays, and that it\n                            may be for my advantage to study new ones hereafter, purchased at my own\n                                expense."}}}]}, {"@type": "act", "@n": "1", "div2": [{"@type": "scene", "@n": "1", "milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "line"}, {"@n": "58", "@unit": "TLN line"}], "stage": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "lemma": {"@targOrder": "U", "#text": "Philotis"}, "#text": ":\n                            This is a protatic character, or one that helps to introduce the subject\n                            of the Play, and then appears no more."}, "#text": "Enter PHILOTIS and SYRA."}, "sp": [{"speaker": "PHILOTIS", "p": "I' faith, Syra, you can find\n                            but very few lovers who prove constant to their mistresses.

We find similar instances mentioned\n                                by Plautus; and violence and debauchery seem almost to have reigned\n                                paramount in the streets at night."}], "#text": "I can not discover any fitting commencement of my troubles, at which to\n                            begin to narrate the things that have so unexpectedly befallen me, some\n                            of which with these eyes I have beheld; some I have heard with my ears;\n                            and on account of which I so hastily betook myself, in extreme\n                            agitation, out of doors. For just now, when, full of alarm, I rushed\n                            into the house, expecting to find my wife afflicted with some other\n                            malady than what I have found it to be--ah me! immediately the\n                            servant-maids beheld that I had arrived, they all at the same moment\n                            joyfully exclaimed, \"He is come,\" from having so suddenly caught sight\n                            of me. But I soon perceived the countenances of all of them\n                                change, because at so\n                            unseasonable a juncture chance had brought me there. One of them in the\n                            mean time hastily ran before me to give notice that I had come.\n                            Impatient to see my wife, I followed close. When I entered the room,\n                            that instant, to my sorrow, I found out her malady; for neither did the\n                            time afford any. interval to enable her to conceal it, nor could she\n                            complain in any other accents than those which the case itself prompted.\n                            When I perceived this: \"O disgraceful conduct!\" I exclaimed, and\n                            instantly hurried away from the spot in tears, overwhelmed by such an\n                            incredible and shocking circumstance. Her mother followed me; just as I\n                            got to the threshold, she threw herself on her knees: I felt compassion\n                            for her. Assuredly it is the fact, in my opinion, just as matters befall\n                            us all, so are we elated or depressed. At once she began to address me\n                            in these words: \"O my dear Pamphilus, you see the reason why she left\n                            your house; for violence was offered to her when formerly a maid, by\n                            some villain to us unknown. Now, she took refuge here then, that from\n                            you and others she might conceal her labor.\" But when I call to mind her\n                            entreaties, I can not, wretched as I am, refrain from tears. \"Whatever\n                            chance or fortune it is,\" said she, \"which has brought you here to-day,\n                            by it we do both conjure you, if with equity and justice we may, that\n                            her misfortune may be concealed by you, and kept a secret from all. If\n                            ever you were sensible, my dear Pamphilus, that she was tenderly\n                            disposed toward you, she now asks you to grant her this favor in return,\n                            without making any difficulty of it. But as to taking her back, act\n                            quite according to your own convenience. You alone are aware of her.\n                            lying-in, and that the child is none of yours. For it is said that it\n                            was two months after the marriage before she had commerce with you. And\n                            then, this is but the seventh month since she came to you. That you are sensible of\n                            this, the circumstances themselves prove. Now, if it is possible,\n                            Pamphilus, I especially wish, and will use my endeavors, that her labor\n                            may remain unknown to her father, and to all, in fact. But if that can\n                            not be managed, and they do find it out, I will say that she miscarried;\n                            I am sure no one will suspect otherwise than, what is so likely, the\n                            child was by you. It shall be instantly exposed; in that case there is\n                            no inconvenience whatever to yourself, and you will be concealing an\n                            outrage so undeservingly committed upon her, poor thing!\" I promised\n                            this, and I am resolved to keep faith in what I said. But as to taking\n                            her back, really I do not think that would be at all creditable, nor\n                            will I do so, although love for her, and habit, have a strong influence\n                            upon me. I weep when it occurs to my mind, what must be her life, and\n                            how great her loneliness in future. O Fortune, thou hast never been\n                            found constant! But by this time my former passion has taught me\n                            experience in the present case. The means by which I got rid of that, I\n                            must employ on the present occasion. Parmeno is coming with the\n                            servants; it is far from convenient that he should be here under present\n                            circumstances, for he was the only person to whom I trusted the secret\n                            that I kept aloof from her when I first married her. I am afraid lest,\n                            if he should frequently hear her cries, he might find out that she is in\n                            labor. He must be dispatched by me somewhere till Philumena is\n                            delivered."}}}, {"@type": "scene", "@n": "4", "milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "line"}, {"@n": "416", "@unit": "TLN line"}], "stage": "Enter at a distance PARMENO and SOSIA, with people carrying\n                        baggage.", "sp": [{"speaker": "PARMENO", "p": {"stage": "to SOSIA.", "#text": "Do you say that this voyage was disagreeable to\n                            you?"}}, {"speaker": "SOSIA", "p": "Upon my faith, Parmeno, it can not be so much as expressed in words, how\n                            disagreeable it is to go on a voyage."}, {"speaker": "PARMENO", "p": "Do you say so?"}, {"speaker": "SOSIA", "p": {"milestone": {"@n": "421", "@unit": "TLN line"}, "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "lemma": {"@targOrder": "U", "#text": "Thirty days or more"}, "placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Athens", "#text": "Athens"}, "#text": ": In\n                                his voyage from Imbros to , namely, which certainly appears to have\n                                been unusually long."}, "#text": "O lucky man!

This ring, in\n                            fact, was the cause of these discoveries being made. For I remember,\n                            that about ten months ago, at an early hour of night, he came running\n                            home to my house, out of breath, without a companion, and surcharged\n                            with wine, with this ring in\n                            his hand. I felt alarmed immediately: \"My Pamphilus,\" I said, \"prithee,\n                            my dear, why thus breathless, or where did you get that ring?-tell me!\"\n                            He began to pretend that he was thinking of something else. When I saw\n                            that, I began to suspect I know not what, and to press him still more to\n                            tell me. The fellow confessed that he had ravished some female, he knew\n                            not whom, in the street; and said, that while she was struggling, he had\n                            taken that ring away from her. Myrrhina here recognized it just now,\n                            while I had it on my finger. She asked whence it came: I told her all\n                            the story. Hence the discovery has been made that it was Philumena\n                            ravished by him, and that this new-born child is his. I am overjoyed\n                            that this happiness hsa befallen him through my agency; although other\n                            courtesans would not have similar feelings; nor, indeed, is it to our\n                            interest that any lover should find pleasure in matrimony.
