            "0":"\n When, O Catiline, do you mean to cease abusing our patience? How long is that madness of\n yours still to mock us? When is there to be an end of that unbridled audacity of yours,\n swaggering about as it does now? Do not the nightly guards placed on the Palatine Hill—do not\n the watches posted throughout the city—does not the alarm of the people, and the union of all\n good men—does not the precaution taken of assembling the senate in this most defensible\n place—do not the looks and countenances of this venerable body here present, have any effect\n upon you? Do you not feel that your plans are detected? Do you not see that your conspiracy is\n already arrested and rendered powerless by the knowledge which every one here possesses of it?\n What is there that you did last night, what the night before— where is it that you were—who was\n there that you summoned to meet you—what design was there which was adopted by you, with which\n you think that any one of us is unacquainted? ",
            "1":"\n \n Shame on the age and on its principles! The senate is aware of these things; the consul sees\n them; and yet this man lives. Lives! aye, he comes even into the senate. He takes a part in the\n public deliberations; he is watching and marking down and checking off for slaughter every\n individual among us. And we, gallant men that we are, think that we are doing our duty to the\n republic if we keep out of the way of his frenzied attacks. \n You ought, O Catiline, long ago to have been led to execution by command of the consul. That\n destruction which you have been long plotting against us ought to have already fallen on your\n own head. ",
            "2":"\n \n What? Did not that most illustrious man, Publius Scipio, the Pontifex Maximus, in his\n capacity of a private citizen, put to death Tiberius Gracchus, though but slightly undermining\n the constitution? And shall we, who are the consuls, tolerate Catiline, openly desirous to\n destroy the whole world with fire and slaughter? For I pass over older instances, such as how\n Caius Servilius Ahala with his own hand slew Spurius Maelius when plotting a revolution in the\n state. There was—there was once such virtue in this republic, that brave men would repress\n mischievous citizens with severer chastisement than the most bitter enemy. For we have a\n resolution of the senate, a formidable and authoritative decree against you, O Catiline; the\n wisdom of the republic is not at fault, nor the dignity of this senatorial body. We, we\n alone,—I say it openly, —we, the consuls, are waiting in our duty. ",
            "3":"\n The senate once passed a decree that Lucius Opimius, the consul, should take care that the\n republic suffered no injury. Not one night elapsed. There was put to death, on some mere\n suspicion of disaffection, Caius Gracchus, a man whose family had borne the most unblemished\n reputation for many generations. There was slain Marcus Fulvius, a man of consular rank, and\n all his children. By a like decree of the senate the safety of the republic was entrusted to\n Caius Marius and Lucius Valerius, the consuls. Did not the vengeance of the republic, did not\n execution overtake Lucius Saturninus, a tribune of the people, and Caius Servilius, the\n praetor, without the delay of one single day? But we, for these twenty days have been allowing\n the edge of the senate's authority to grow blunt, as it were. For we are in possession of a\n similar decree of the senate, but we keep it locked up in its parchment—buried, I may say, in\n the sheath; and according to this decree you ought, O Catiline, to be put to death this\n instant. You live,—and you live, not to lay aside, but to persist in your audacity. \n I wish, O conscript fathers, to be merciful; I wish not to appear negligent amid such danger\n to the state; but I do now accuse myself of remissness and culpable inactivity. ",
            "4":" A camp is pitched in Italy , at\n the entrance of Etruria, in hostility to the republic; the number of the enemy increases every\n day; and yet the general of that camp, the leader of those enemies, we see within the\n walls—yes, and even in the senate, —planning every day some internal injury to the republic.\n If, O Catiline, I should now order you to be arrested, to be\n put to death, I should, I suppose, have to fear lest all good men should say that I had acted\n tardily, rather than that any one should affirm that I acted cruelly. But yet this, which ought\n to have been done long since, I have good reason for not doing as yet; I will put you to death,\n then, when there shall be not one person possible to be found so wicked, so abandoned, so like\n yourself, as not to allow that it has been rightly done. ",
            "5":" As\n long as one person exists who can dare to defend you, yet shall live; but you shall live as you\n do now, surrounded by my many and trusty guards, so that you shall not be able to stir one\n finger against the republic: many eyes and ears shall still observe and watch you, as they have\n hitherto done, though you shall not perceive them. \n For what is there, O Catiline, that you can still expect, if night is not able to veil your\n nefarious meetings in darkness, and if private houses cannot conceal the voice of your\n conspiracy within their walls;—if everything is seen and displayed? Change your mind: trust me:\n forget the slaughter and conflagration you are meditating. You are hemmed in on all sides; all\n your plans are clearer than the day to us; let me remind you of them. ",
            "6":" Do you recollect that on the 21st of October I said in the senate, that on a\n certain day, which was to be the 27th of October, C. Manlius, the satellite and servant of your\n audacity, would be in arms? Was I mistaken, Catiline, not only in so important, so atrocious,\n so incredible a fact, but, what is much more remarkable, in the very day? I said also in the\n senate that you had fixed the massacre of the nobles for the 28th of October, when many chief\n men of the senate had left Rome , not so much for the\n sake of saving themselves as of checking your designs. Can you deny that on that very day you\n were so hemmed in by my guards and my vigilance, that you were unable to stir one finger\n against the republic; when you said that you would be content with the flight of the rest, and\n the slaughter of us who remained? ",
            "7":" What? when you made sure\n that you would be able to seize Praeneste on the\n first of November by a nocturnal attack, did you not find that that colony was fortified by my\n order, by my garrison, by my watchfulness and care? You do nothing, you plan nothing, you think\n of nothing which I not only do not hear, but which I do not see and know every particular of.\n \n Listen while I speak of the night before. You shall now see that I watch far more actively\n for the safety than you do for the destruction of the republic. I say that you came the night\n before (I will say nothing obscurely) into the Scythe-dealers' street, to the house of Marcus\n Lecca; that many of your accomplices in the same insanity and wickedness came here too. Do you\n dare to deny it? Why are silent? I will prove it if you do deny it; for I see here in the\n senate some men who were there with you. ",
            "8":"\n \n O ye immortal gods, where on earth are we? in what city are we living? what constitution is\n ours? There are here,—here in our body, O conscript fathers, in this the most holy and\n dignified assembly of the whole world, men who meditate my death, and the death of all of us,\n and the destruction of this city, and of the whole world. I, the consul see them; I ask them\n their opinion about the republic, and I do not yet attack, even by words, those who ought to be\n put to death by the sword. You were, then, O Catiline, at Lecca's that night; you divided\n Italy into sections; you settled where every one was\n to go; you fixed whom you were to leave at Rome , whom\n you were to take with you; you portioned out the divisions of the city for conflagration; you\n undertook that you yourself would at once leave the city, and said that there was then only\n this to delay you, that I was still alive. Two Roman knights were found to deliver you from\n this anxiety, and to promise that very night, before daybreak, to slay me in my bed. ",
            "9":" All this I knew almost before your meeting had broken up. I\n strengthened and fortified my house with a stronger guard; I refused admittance, when they\n came, to those whom you sent in the morning to salute me, and of whom I had foretold to many\n eminent men that they would come to me at that time. \n As, then, this is the case, O Catiline, continue as you have begun. Leave the city at last\n the gates are open; depart. That Manlian camp of yours has been waiting too long for you as its\n general. And lead forth with you all your friends, or at least as many as you can; purge the\n city of your presence; you will deliver me from a great fear, when there is a wall between me\n and you. Among us you can dwell no longer—I will not bear it, I will not permit it, I will not\n tolerate it.. ",
            "10":" Great thanks are due to the immortal gods, and\n to this very Jupiter Stator, in whose temple we are, the most ancient protector of thus city,\n that we have already so often escaped so foul, so horrible, and so deadly an enemy to the\n republic. But the safety of the commonwealth must not be too often allowed to be risked on one\n man. As long as you, O Catiline, plotted against me while I was the consul elect, I defended\n myself not with a public guard, but by my own private diligence. When, in the next consular\n comitia , you wished to slay me when I was actually consul,\n and your competitors also, in the Campus Martius , I\n checked your nefarious attempt by the assistance and resources of my own friends, without\n exciting any disturbance publicly. In short, as often as you attacked me, I by myself opposed\n you, and that, too, though I saw that my ruin was connected with great disaster to the\n republic. ",
            "11":" But now you are openly attacking the entire\n republic. \n You are summoning to destruction and devastation the temples of the immortal gods, the houses\n of the city, the lives of all the citizens; in short, all Italy . Wherefore, since I do not yet venture to do that which is the best thing,\n and which belongs to my office and to the discipline of our ancestors, I will do that which is\n more merciful if we regard its rigour, and more expedient for the state. For if I order you to\n be put to death, the rest of the conspirators will still remain in the republic; if as I have\n long been exhorting you, you depart, your companions, those worthless dregs of the republic,\n will be drawn off from the city too. ",
            "12":" What is the matter,\n Catiline? Do you hesitate to do that which I order you which you were already doing of your own\n accord? The consul orders an enemy to depart from the city. Do you ask me, Are you to go into\n banishment? I do not order it; but, if you consult me, I advise it. \n For what is there, O Catiline, that can now afford you any pleasure in this city? for there\n is no one in it, except that band of profligate conspirators of yours, who does not fear\n you,—no one who does not hate you. What brand of domestic baseness is not stamped upon your\n life? What disgraceful circumstance is wanting to your infamy in your private affairs? From\n what licentiousness have your eyes, from what atrocity have your hands, from what iniquity has\n your whole body ever abstained? Is there one youth, when you have once entangled him in the\n temptations of your corruption, to whom you have not held out a sword for audacious crime, or a\n torch for licentious wickedness? ",
            "13":"\n \n What? when lately by the death of your former wife you had made your house empty and ready\n for a new bridal, did you not even add another incredible wickedness to this wickedness? But I\n pass that over, and willingly allow it to be buried in silence, that so horrible a crime may\n not be seen to have existed in this city, and not to have been chastised. I pass over the ruin\n of your fortune, which you know is hanging over you against the ides of the very next month; I\n come to those things which relate not to the infamy of your private vices, not to your domestic\n difficulties and baseness, but to the welfare of the republic and to the lives and safety of us\n all. ",
            "14":" Can the limit of this life, O Catiline, can the breath of\n this atmosphere be pleasant to you, when you know that there is not one man of those here\n present who is ignorant that you, on the last day of the year, when Lepidus and Tullus were\n consuls, stood in the assembly armed; that you had prepared your hand for the slaughter of the\n consuls and chief men of the state, and that no reason or fear of yours hindered your crime and\n madness, but the fortune of the republic? And I say no more of these things, for they are not\n unknown to every one. How often have you endeavoured to slay me, both as consul elect and as\n actual consul? how many shots of yours, so aimed that they seemed impossible to be escaped,\n have I avoided by some slight stooping aside, and some dodging, as it were, of my body? You\n attempt nothing, you execute nothing, you devise nothing that call be kept hid from me at the\n proper time; and yet you do not cease to attempt and to contrive. ",
            "15":" How often already has that dagger of yours been wrested from your hands? how\n often has it slipped through them by some chance, and dropped down? and yet you cannot any\n longer do without it; and to what sacred mysteries it is consecrated and devoted by you I know\n not, that you think it necessary to plunge it in the body of the consul. \n But now, what is that life of yours that you are leading? For I will speak to you not so as\n to seem influenced by the hatred I ought to feel, but by pity, nothing of which is due to you.\n You came a little while ago into the senate in so numerous an assembly, who of so many friends\n and connections of yours saluted you? If this in the memory of man never happened to any one\n else, are you waiting for insults by word of mouth, when you are overwhelmed by the most\n irresistible condemnation of silence? Is it nothing that at your arrival all those seats were\n vacated? that all the men of consular rank, who had often been marked out by you for slaughter,\n the very moment you sat down, left that part of the benches bare and vacant? With what feelings\n do you think you ought to bear this? ",
            "16":" On my honour, if my\n slaves feared me as all your fellow-citizens fear you, I should think I must leave my house. Do\n not you think you should leave the city? If I saw that I was even undeservedly so suspected and\n bated by my fellow-citizens, I would rather flee from their sight than be gazed at by the\n hostile eyes of every one. And do you, who, from the consciousness of your wickedness, know\n that the hatred of all men is just and has been long due to you, hesitate to avoid the sight\n and presence of those men whose minds and senses you offend? If your parents feared and hated\n you, and if you could by no means pacify them, you would, I think, depart somewhere out of\n their sight. Now, your country, which is the common parent of all of us, hates and fears you,\n and has no other opinion of you, than that you are meditating parricide in her case; and will\n you neither feel awe of her authority, nor deference for her judgment, nor fear of her power?",
            "17":" And she, O Catiline, thus pleads with you, and after a\n manner silently speaks to you:—There has now for many years been no crime committed but by you;\n no atrocity has taken place without you; you alone unpunished and unquestioned have murdered\n the citizens, have harassed and plundered the allies; you alone have had power not only to\n neglect all laws and investigations, but to overthrow and break through them. Your former\n actions, though they ought not to have been borne, yet I did bear as well as I could; but now\n that I should be wholly occupied with fear of you alone, that at every sound I should dread\n Catiline, that no design should seem possible to be entertained against me which does not\n proceed from your wickedness, this is no longer endurable. Depart, then, and deliver me from\n this fear; that, if it be a just one, I may not be destroyed; if an imaginary one, that at\n least I may at last cease to fear. ",
            "18":"\n If, as I have said, your country were thus to address you, ought she not to obtain her\n request, even if she were not able to enforce it? What shall I say of your having given\n yourself into custody? what of your having said, for the sake of avoiding suspicion, that you\n were willing to dwell in the house of Marcus Lepidus? And when you were not received by him,\n you dared even to come to me, and begged me to keep you in my house; and when you had received\n answer from me that I could not possibly be safe in the same house with you, when I considered\n myself in great danger as long as we were in the same city, you came to Quintus Metellus, the\n praetor, and being rejected by him, you passed on to your associate, that most excellent man,\n Marcus Marcellus, who would be, I suppose you thought, most diligent in guarding you, most\n sagacious hi suspecting you, and most bold in punishing you; but how far can we think that man\n ought to be from bonds and imprisonment who has already judged himself deserving of being given\n into custody? ",
            "19":"\n \n Since, then, this is the case, do you hesitate, O Catiline, if you cannot remain here with\n tranquillity, to depart to some distant laud, and to trust your life, saved from just and\n deserved punishment, to flight and solitude? Make a motion, say you, to the senate, (for that\n is what you demand) and if thus body votes that you ought to go into banishment, you say that\n you will obey. I will not make such a motion, it is contrary to my principles, and yet I will\n let you see what these men think of you. Be gone from the city, O Catiline, deliver the\n republic from fear; depart into banishment, if that is the word you are waiting for. What now,\n O Catiline? Do you not perceive, do you not see the silence of these men; they permit it, they\n say nothing; why wait you for the authority of their words when you see their wishes in their\n silence?",
            "20":" But had I said the same to this excellent young man,\n Publius Sextius, or to that brave man, Marcus Marcellus, before this time the senate would\n deservedly have laid violent hands on me, consul though I be, in this very temple. But to you,\n Catiline, while they are quiet they approve, while they permit me to speak they vote, while\n they are silent they are loud and eloquent. And not they alone, whose authority forsooth is\n dear to you, though their lives are unimportant, but the Roman knights too, those most\n honourable and excellent men, and the other virtuous citizens who are now surrounding the\n senate, whose numbers you could see, whose desires you could know, and whose voices you a few\n minutes ago could hear,—yes, whose very hands and weapons I have for some time been scarcely\n able to keep off from you; but those, too, I will easily bring to attend you to the gates if\n you leave these places you have been long desiring to lay waste. ",
            "21":"\n And yet, why am I speaking? that anything may change your purpose? that you may ever amend\n your life? that you may meditate flight or think of voluntary banishment? I wish the gods may\n give you such a mind; though I see, if alarmed at my words you bring your mind to go into\n banishment, what a storm of unpopularity hangs over me, if not at present, while the memory of\n your wickedness is fresh, at all events hereafter. But it is worthwhile to incur that, as long\n as that is but a private misfortune of my own, and is unconnected with the dangers of the\n republic. But we cannot expect that you should be concerned at your own vices, that you should\n fear the penalties of the laws, or that you should yield to the necessities of the republic,\n for you are not, O Catiline, one whom either shame can recall from infamy, or fear from danger,\n or reason from madness.",
            "22":" Wherefore, as I have said before, go forth, and if you to\n make me, your enemy as you call me, unpopular, go straight into banishment. I shall scarcely be\n able to endue all that will be said if you do so; I shall scarcely be able to support my load\n of unpopularity if you do go into banishment at the command of the consul; but if you wish\n serve my credit and reputation, go forth with your ill-omened band of profligates; betake\n yourself to Manilius, rouse up the abandoned citizens, separate yourself from the good ones,\n wage war against your country, exult in your impious banditti, so that you may not seem to have\n been driven out by me and gone to strangers, but to have gone invited to your own\n friends.",
            "23":"\n \n Though why should I invite you, by whom I know men have been already sent on to wait in arms\n for you at the forum Aurelium; who I know has fixed and agreed with Manlius upon a settled day;\n by whom I know that that silver eagle, which I trust will be ruinous and fatal to you and to\n all your friends, and to which there was set up in your house a shrine as it were of your\n crimes, has been already sent forward. Need I fear that you can long do without that which you\n used to worship when going out to do murder, and from whose altars you have often transferred\n your impious hand to the slaughter of citizens? ",
            "24":"\n You will go at last where your unbridled and mad desire has been long hurrying you. And this\n causes you no grief; but an incredible pleasure. Nature has formed you, desire has trained you,\n fortune has preserved you for this insanity. Not only did you never desire quiet, but you never\n even desired any war but a criminal one; you have collected a baud of profligates and worthless\n men, abandoned not only by all fortune but even by hope.",
            "25":" Then what happiness will you enjoy with what delight will\n you exult in what pleasure will you revel! when in so numerous a body of friends, you neither\n hear nor see one good man. All the toils you have gone through have always pointed to this sort\n of life; your lying on the ground not merely to lie in wait to gratify your unclean desires,\n but even to accomplish crimes; your vigilance, not only when plotting against the sleep of\n husbands, but also against the goods of your murdered victims, have all been preparations for\n this. Now you have an opportunity of displaying your splendid endurance of hunger, of cold, of\n want of everything; by which in a short time you will find yourself worn out. ",
            "26":" All this I effected when I procured your rejection from the consulship, that\n you should be reduced to make attempts on your country as an exile, instead of being able to\n distress it as consul, and that that which had been wickedly undertaken by you should be called\n piracy rather than war. \n Know that I may remove and avert, O conscript fathers, any in the least reasonable complaint\n from myself; listen, I beseech you, carefully to what I say, and lay it up in your inmost\n hearts and minds. In truth, if my country, which is far dearer to me than my life,—if all\n Italy ,—if the whole republic were to address me,\n “Marcus Tullius, what are you doing? will you permit that man to depart whom you have\n ascertained to be an enemy? whom you see ready to become the general of the war? whom you know\n to be expected in the camp of the enemy as their chief; the author of all this wickedness, the\n head of the conspiracy, the instigator of the slaves and abandoned citizens, so that he shall\n seem not driven out of the city by you, but let loose by you against the city? Will you not\n order him to be thrown into prison, to be hurried off to execution, to be put to death with the\n most prompt severity? What hinders you? is it the customs of our ancestors? ",
            "27":" But even private men have often in this republic slain mischievous\n citizens.—Is it the laws which have been passed about the punishment of Roman citizens? But in\n this city those who have rebelled against the republic have never had the rights of\n citizens.—Do you fear odium with posterity? You are showing fine gratitude to the Roman people\n which has raised you, a man known only by your own actions, of no ancestral renown, through all\n the degrees of honour at so early an age to the very highest office, if from fear of\n unpopularity or of any danger you neglect the safety of your fellow-citizens. ",
            "28":" But if you have a fear of unpopularity, is that arising from the imputation\n of vigour and boldness, or that arising from that of inactivity and indecision most to be\n feared? When Italy is laid waste by war, when cities\n are attacked and houses in flames, do you not think that you will be then consumed by a perfect\n conflagration of hatred?” \n To this holy address of the republic, and to the feelings of those men who entertain the same\n opinion, I will make this short answer:—If, O conscript fathers, I thought it best that\n Catiline should be punished with death, I would not have given the space of one hour to this\n gladiator to live in. If, forsooth, those excellent men and most illustrious cities not only\n did not pollute themselves, but even glorified themselves by the blood of Saturninus, and the\n Gracchi, and Flaccus, and many others of old time, surely I had no cause to fear lest for\n slaying this parricidal murderer of the citizens any unpopularity should accrue to me with\n posterity. And if it did threaten me to ever so great a degree, yet I have always been of the\n disposition to think unpopularity earned by virtue and glory, not unpopularity. ",
            "29":"\n \n Though there are some men in this body who either do not see what threatens, or dissemble\n what they do see; who have fed the hope of Catiline by mild sentiments, and have strengthened\n the rising conspiracy by not believing it; influenced by whose authority many, and they not\n wicked, but only ignorant, if I punished him would say that I had acted cruelly and\n tyranically. But I know that if he arrives at the camp of Manlius to which he is going, there\n will be no one so stupid as not to see that there has been a conspiracy; no one so hardened as\n not to confess it. But if this man alone were put to death, I know that this disease of the\n republic would be only checked for awhile, not eradicated for ever. But if he banishes himself;\n and takes with him all his friends, and collects at one point all the ruined men from every\n quarter, then not only will this full-grown plague of the republic be extinguished and\n eradicated, but also the root and seed of all future evils ",
            "30":"\n We have now for a long time, O conscript fathers, lived among these dangers and machinations\n of conspiracy; but somehow or other, the ripeness of all wickedness, and of this long-standing\n madness and audacity, has come to a head at the time of my consulship. But if this man alone is\n removed from this piratical crew, we may appear, perhaps, for a short time relieved from fear\n and anxiety, but the danger will settle down and lie hid in the veins and bowels of the\n republic. As it often happens that men afflicted with a severe disease, when they are tortured\n with heat and fever, if they drink cold water, seem at first to be relieved, but afterwards\n stiffer more and more severely; so this disease which is in the republic, if relieved by the\n punishment of this man, will only get worse and worse, as the rest will be still alive.\n ",
            "31":"\n \n Wherefore, O conscript fathers, let the worthless be gone,—let them separate themselves from\n the good,—let them collect in one place,—let them, as I have often said before, be separated\n from us by a wall; let them cease to plot against the consul in his own house,—to surround the\n tribunal of the city praetor,—to besiege the senate-house with swords,—to prepare brands and\n torches to burn the city; let it, in short, be written on the brow of every citizen, what are\n his sentiments about the republic. I promise you this, O conscript fathers, that there shall be\n so much diligence in us the consuls, much authority in you, so much virtue in the Roman\n knights, so much unanimity in all good men, that you shall see everything made plain and\n manifest by the departure of Catiline,—everything checked and punished. ",
            "32":"\n With these omens, O Catiline, be gone to your impious and nefarious war, to the great safety\n of the republic, to your own misfortune and injury, and to the destruction of those who have\n joined themselves to you in every wickedness and atrocity. Then do you, O Jupiter, who were\n consecrated by Romulus with the same auspices as this city, whom we rightly call the stay of\n this city and empire, repel this man and his companions from your altars and from the other\n temples,—from the houses and walls of the city,—from the lives and fortunes of all the\n citizens; and overwhelm all the enemies of good men, the foes of the republic, the robbers of\n Italy, men bound together by a treaty and infamous alliance of crimes, dead and alive, with\n eternal punishments."

            "0":"\n At length, O Romans, we have dismissed from the city, or driven out, or, when he was\n departing of his own accord, we have pursued with words, Lucius Catiline, mad with audacity,\n breathing wickedness, impiously planning mischief to his country, threatening fire and sword to\n you and to this city. He is gone, he has departed, he has disappeared, he has rushed out. No\n injury will now be prepared against these walls within the walls themselves by that monster and\n prodigy of wickedness. And we have, without controversy, defeated him, the sole general of this\n domestic war. For now that dagger will no longer hover about our sides; we shall not be afraid\n in the campus, in the forum, in the senate-house,—yes, and within our own private walls, he was\n moved from his place when he was driven from the city. Now we shall openly carry on a regular\n war with an enemy without hindrance. Beyond all question we ruin the man; we have defeated him\n splendidly when we have driven him from secret treachery into open warfare. ",
            "1":"But that he has not taken with him his sword red with blood as he\n intruded—that he has left us alive,—that we wrested the weapon from his hands,—that he has left\n the citizens safe and the city standing, what great and overwhelming grief must you think that\n this is to him. Now he lies prostrate, O Romans, and feels himself stricken down and abject,\n and often casts back his eyes towards this city, which he mourns over as snatched from his\n jaws, but which seems to me to rejoice at having vomited forth such a pest, and cast it out of\n doors. ",
            "2":"\n But if there be any one of that disposition which all men should have, who yet blames me\n greatly for the very thing in which my speech exults and triumphs,—namely, that I did not\n arrest so capital mortal an enemy rather than let him go,—that is not my fault, O citizens, but\n the fault of the times. Lucius Catiline ought to have been visited with the severest\n punishment, and to have been put to death long since; and both the customs of our ancestors,\n and the rigour of my office, and the republic, demanded this of me; but how many, think you,\n were there who did not believe what I reported? how many who out of stupidity did not think so?\n how many who even defended him,—how many who, out of their own depravity, favoured him? If, in\n truth, I had thought that, if he were removed, all danger would he removed from you, I would\n long since have cut off Lucius Catiline, had it been at the risk, not only of my popularity,\n but even of my life.",
            "3":" But as I saw that, since the matter was not even then\n proved to all of you, if I had punished him with death, as he had deserved, I should be borne\n down by unpopularity, and so be unable to follow up his accomplices, I brought the business on\n to this point that you might be able to combat openly when you saw the enemy without disguise.\n But how exceedingly I think this enemy to be feared now that he is out of doors, you may see\n from this—that I am vexed even that be has gone from the city with but a small retinue. I wish\n he had taken with him all his forces. He has taken with him Tongillus, with whom he had been\n said to have a criminal intimacy, and Publicius, and Munatius, whose debts contracted in\n taverns could cause no great disquietude to the republic. He has left behind him others—you all\n know what men they are, how overwhelmed with debt, how powerful, how noble. ",
            "4":"\n Therefore, with our Gallic legions, and with the levies which Quintus Metellus has raised in\n the Picenian and Gallic territory, and with these troops which are every day being got ready by\n us, I thoroughly despise that army composed of desperate old men, of clownish profligates, and\n uneducated spendthrifts; of those who have preferred to desert their bail rather than that\n army, and which will fall to pieces if I show them not the battle array of our army, but an\n edict of the praetor. I wish he had taken with him those soldiers of his, whom I see hovering\n about the forum, standing about the senate-house, even coming into the senate, who shine with\n ointment, who glitter in purple; and if they remain here, remember that that army is not so\n much to be feared by us as these men who have deserted the army. And they are the more to be\n feared, because they are aware that I know what they are thinking of and yet they are not\n influenced by it.",
            "5":" I know to whom Apulia has been allotted, who has Etruria, who the Picenian territory, who the\n Gallic district, who has begged for himself the office of spreading fire and sword by night\n through the city. They know that all the plans of the preceding night are brought to me. I laid\n them before the senate yesterday. Catiline himself was alarmed, and fled. Why do these men\n wait? Verily, they are greatly mistaken if they think that former lenity of mine will last\n forever. \n What I have been waiting for, that I have gained,—namely, that you should all see that a\n conspiracy has been openly formed against the republic; unless, indeed, there be any one who\n thinks that those who are like Catiline do not agree with Catiline. There is not any longer\n room for lenity; the business itself demands severity. One thing, even now, I will grant,—let\n them depart, let them be gone. Let them not suffer the unhappy Catiline to pine away for want\n of them. I will tell them the road. He went by the Aurelian road. If they make haste, they will\n catch him by the evening. ",
            "6":"O happy republic, if it can cast\n forth these dregs of the republic! Even now, when Catiline alone is got rid of; the republic\n seems to me relieved and refreshed; for what evil or wickedness can be devised or imagined\n which he did not conceive? What prisoner, what gladiator, what thief; what assassin, what\n parricide, what forger of wills, what cheat, what debauchee, what spendthrift, what adulterer,\n what abandoned woman, what corrupter of youth, what profligate, what scoundrel can be found in\n all Italy, who does not avow that he has been on terms of intimacy with Catiline? What murder\n has been committed for years without him? What nefarious act of infamy that has not been done\n by him? ",
            "7":"\n \n But in what other man were there ever so many allurements for youth as in him, who both\n indulged in infamous love for others, and encouraged their infamous affections for himself,\n promising to some enjoyment of their lust, to others the death of their parents, and not only\n instigating them to iniquity, but even assisting them in it. But now, how suddenly had he\n collected, not only out of the city, but even out of the country, a number of abandoned men? No\n one, not only at Rome , but in every corner of\n Italy , was overwhelmed with debt whom he did not\n enlist in this incredible association of wickedness. ",
            "8":"\n And, that you may understand the diversity of his pursuits and the variety of his designs,\n there was no one in any school of gladiators, at all inclined to audacity, who does not avow\n himself to be an intimate friend of Catiline,—no one on the stage, at all of a fickle and\n worthless disposition, who does not profess himself his companion. And he, trained in the\n practice of insult and wickedness, in enduring cold, and hunger, and thirst, and watching, was\n called a brave man by those fellows, while all the appliances of industry and instruments of\n virtue were devoted to lust and atrocity. ",
            "9":"\n \n But if his companions follow him,—if the infamous herd of desperate men depart from the city,\n O happy shall we be, fortunate will be the republic, illustrious will be the renown of my\n consulship. For theirs is no ordinary insolence,—no common and endurable audacity. They think\n of nothing but slaughter, conflagration, and rapine. They have dissipated their patrimonies,\n they have squandered their fortunes. Money has long failed them, and now credit begins to fail;\n but the same desires remain which they had in their time of abundance. But if in their drinking\n and gambling parties they were content with feasts and harlots, they would be in a hopeless\n state indeed; but yet they might be endured. But who can bear this,—that indolent men should\n plot against the bravest,—drunkards against the sober,—men asleep against men awake,—men lying\n at feasts, embracing abandoned women, languid with wine, crammed with food, crowned with\n chaplets, reeking with ointments, worn out with lust, belch out in their discourse the murder\n of all good men, and the conflagration of the city? \n ",
            "10":" But I am confident that some fate is hanging over these men;\n and that the punishment long since due to their iniquity, and worthlessness, and wickedness,\n and lust, is either visibly at hand or at least rapidly approaching. And if my consulship shall\n have removed, since it cannot cure them, it will have added, not some brief span, but many ages\n of existence to the republic. For there is no nation for us to fear,—no king who can make war\n on the Roman people. All foreign affairs are tranquilized, both by land and sea, by the valour\n of one man. Domestic war alone remains. The only plots against us are within our own walls,—the\n danger is within,—the enemy is within. We must war with luxury, with madness, with wickedness.\n For this war, O citizens, I offer myself as the general. I take on myself the enmity of\n profligate men. What can be cured, I will cure, by whatever means it may be possible. What must\n be cut away, I will not suffer to spread, to the ruin of the republic. Let them depart, or let\n them stay quiet; or if they remain in the city and in the same disposition as at present, let\n them expect what they deserve. ",
            "11":"\n But there are men, O Romans, who say that Catiline has been driven by me into banishment. But\n if I could do so by a word, I would drive out those also who say so. Forsooth, that timid, that\n excessively bashful man could not bear the voice of the consul; as soon as he was ordered to go\n into banishment, he obeyed, he was quiet. Yesterday, when I had been all but murdered at my own\n house, I convoked the senate in the temple of Jupiter Stator; I related the whole affair to the\n conscript fathers; and when Catiline came thither, what senator addressed him? who saluted him?\n who looked upon him not so much even as an abandoned citizen, as an implacable enemy? Nay the\n chiefs of that body left that part of the benches to which he came naked and empty. ",
            "12":" On this I, that violent consul, who drive citizens into\n exile by a word, asked of Catiline whether he had been at the nocturnal meeting at Marcus\n Lecca's, or not; when that most audacious man, convicted by his own conscience, was at first\n silent. I related all the other circumstances; I described what he had done that night, where\n he had been, what he had arranged for the next night, how the plan of the whole war had been\n laid down by him. When he hesitated, when he was convicted, I asked why he hesitated to go\n whither he had been long been preparing to go; when I knew that arms, that the axes, the\n fasces , and trumpets, and military standards, and that silver\n eagle to which he had made a shrine in his own house, had been sent on? ",
            "13":" Did I drive him into exile who I knew had already entered upon war? I suppose\n Manlius, that centurion who has pitched his camp in the Faesulan district, has proclaimed war\n against the Roman people in his own name; and that camp is not now waiting for Catiline as its\n general, and he, driven indeed into exile, will go to Marseilles , as they say, and not to that camp. \n O the hard lot of those, not only of those who govern, but even of those who save the\n republic. Now, if Lucius Catiline, hemmed in and rendered powerless by my counsels, by my\n toils, by my dangers, should on a sudden become alarmed, should change his designs, should\n desert his friends, should abandon his design of making war, should change his path from this\n course of wickedness and war, and betake himself to flight and exile, he will not be said to\n have been deprived by me of the arms of his audacity, to have been astounded and terrified by\n my diligence, to have been driven from his hope and from his enterprise, but, uncondemned and\n innocent, to have been driven into banishment by the consul by threats and violence; and there\n will be some who will seek to have him thought not worthless but unfortunate, and be considered\n not a most active consul, but a most cruel tyrant. ",
            "14":" I am not\n unwilling, O Romans, to endure this storm of false and unjust unpopularity as long as the\n danger of this horrible and nefarious war is warded off from you. Let him be said to be\n banished by me as long as he goes into banishment; but, believe me, he will not go. I will\n never ask of the immortal gods, O Romans, for the sake of lightening my own unpopularity, for\n you to hear that Lucius Catiline is leading an army of enemies, and is hovering about in arms;\n but yet in three days you will hear it. And I much more fear that it will be objected to me\n some day or other, that I have let him escape, rather than that I have banished him. But when\n there are men who say he has been banished because he has gone away, what would these men say\n if he had been put to death? ",
            "15":"\n \n Although those men who keep saying that Catiline is going to Marseilles do not complain of this so much as they fear it; for there is not one\n of them so inclined to pity, as not to prefer that he should go to Manlius rather than to\n Marseilles . But he, if he had never before planned\n what he is now doing, yet would rather be slain while living as a bandit, than live as an\n exile; but now, when nothing has happened to him contrary to his own wish and design,—except,\n indeed, that he has left Rome while we are alive,—let\n us wish rather that he may go into exile than complain of it. ",
            "16":"\n But why are we speaking so long about one enemy; and about that enemy who now avows that he\n is one; and whom I now do not fear, because, as I have always wished, a wall is between us; and\n are saying nothing about those who dissemble, who remain at Rome , who are among us? Whom, indeed, if it were by any means possible, I should\n be anxious not so much to chastise as to cure, and to make friendly to the republic; nor, if\n they will listen to me, do I quite know why that may not be. For I will tell you, O Romans, of\n what classes of men those forces are made up, and then, if I can, I will apply to each the\n medicine of my advice and persuasion.",
            "17":" There is one class of them, who, with enormous debts, have\n still greater possessions, and who can by no means be detached from their affection to them. Of\n these men the appearance is most respectable, for they are wealthy, but their intention and\n their cause are most shameless. Will you be rich in lands, in houses, in money, in slaves, in\n all things, and yet hesitate to diminish your possessions to add to your credit? What are you\n expecting? War? What! in the devastation of all things, do you believe that your own\n possessions will be held sacred? do you expect an abolition of debts? They are mistaken who\n expect that from Catiline. There may be schedules made out, owing to my exertions, but they\n will be only catalogues of sale. Nor can those who have possessions be safe by any other means;\n and if they had been willing to adopt this plan earlier, and not, as is very foolish, to\n struggle on against usury with the profits of their farms, we should have them now richer and\n better citizens. But I think these men are the least of all to be dreaded, because they can\n either be persuaded to abandon their opinions, or if they cling to them, they seem to me more\n likely to form wishes against the republic than to bear arms against it. ",
            "18":"\n There is another class of them, who, although they are harassed by debt, yet are expecting\n supreme power; they wish to become masters. They think that when the republic is in confusion\n they may gain those honours which they despair of when it is in tranquillity. And they must, I\n think, be told the same as every one else,—to despair of obtaining what they are aiming at;\n that in the first place, I myself am watchful for, am present to, am providing for the\n republic. Besides that, there is a high spirit in the virtuous citizens, great unanimity, great\n numbers, and also a great body of troops. Above all that, the immortal gods will stand by and\n bring aid to this invincible nation, this most illustrious empire, this most beautiful city,\n against such wicked violence. And if they had already got that which they with the greatest\n madness wish for, do they think that in the ashes of the city and blood of the citizens, which\n in their wicked and infamous hearts they desire, they will become consuls and dictators and\n even kings? Do they not see that they are wishing for that which, if they were to obtain it,\n must be given up to some fugitive slave, or to some gladiator? ",
            "19":"\n \n There is a third class, already touched by age, but still vigorous from constant exercise; of\n which class is Manlius himself; whom Catiline is now succeeding. These are men of those\n colonies which Sulla established at Faesulae ,\n which I know to be composed, on the whole, of excellent citizens and brave men; but yet these\n are colonists, who, from becoming possessed of unexpected and sudden wealth, boast themselves\n extravagantly and insolently; these men, while they build like rich men, while they delight in\n farms, in litters, in vast families of slaves, in luxurious banquets, have incurred such great\n debts, that, if they would be saved, they must raise Sulla from the dead; and they have even\n excited some countrymen, poor and needy men, to entertain the same hopes of plunder as\n themselves. And all these men, O Romans, I place in the same class of robbers and banditti.\n But, I warn them, let them cease to be mad, and to think of proscriptions and dictatorships;\n for such a horror of these times is ingrained into the city, that not even men, but it seems to\n me that even the very cattle would refuse to bear them again. ",
            "20":"\n There is a fourth class, various, promiscuous and turbulent; who indeed are now overwhelmed;\n who will never recover themselves; who, partly from indolence, partly from managing their\n affairs badly, partly from extravagance, are embarrassed by old debts; and worn out with bail\n bonds, and judgments, and seizures of their goods, are said to be betaking themselves in\n numbers to that camp both from the city and the country. These men I think not so much active\n soldiers as lazy insolvents; who, if they cannot stand at first, may fall, but fall so, that\n not only the city but even their nearest neighbours know nothing of it. For I do not understand\n why, if they cannot live with honour, they should wish to die shamefully; or wily they think\n they shall perish with less pain in a crowd, than if they perish by themselves. ",
            "21":"\n \n There is a fifth class, of parricides, assassins, in short of all infamous characters, whom I\n do not wish to recall from Catiline, and indeed they cannot be separated from him. Let them\n perish in their wicked war, since they are so numerous that a prison cannot contain them. \n There is a last class, last not only in number but in the sort of men and in their way of\n life; the especial body-guard of Catiline, of his levying; yes, the friends of his embraces and\n of his bosom; whom you see with carefully combed hair, glossy, beardless, or with well-trimmed\n beards; with tunics with sleeves, or reaching to the ankles; clothed with veils, not with\n robes; all the industry of whose life, all the labour of whose watchfulness, is expended in\n suppers lasting till daybreak. ",
            "22":"\n \n In these bands are all the gamblers, all the adulterers, all the unclean and shameless\n citizens. These boys, so witty and delicate, have learnt not only to love and to be loved, not\n only to sing and to dance, but also to brandish daggers and to administer poisons; and unless\n they are driven out, unless they die, even should Catiline die, I warn you that the school of\n Catiline would exist in the republic. But what do those wretches want? Are they going to take\n their wives with them to the camp? how can they do without them, especially in these nights?\n and how will they endure the Apennines , and these\n frosts, and this snow? unless they think that they will bear the winter more easily because\n they have been in the habit of dancing naked at their feasts. O war much to be dreaded, when\n Catiline is going to have his bodyguard of prostitutes! ",
            "23":"\n Array now, O Romans, against these splendid troops of Catiline, your guards and your armies;\n and first of all oppose to that worn-out and wounded gladiator your consuls and generals; then\n against that banished and enfeebled troop of ruined men lead out the flower and strength of all\n Italy instantly the cities of the colonies and\n municipalities will match the rustic mounds of Catiline; and I will not condescend to compare\n the rest of your troops and equipments and guards with the want and destitution of that\n highwayman. ",
            "24":" But if, omitting all these things in which we\n are rich and of which he is destitute,—the senate, the Roman knights, the people, the city, the\n treasury, the revenues, all Italy , all the provinces,\n foreign nations,—if I say, omitting all these things, we choose to compare the causes\n themselves which are opposed to one another, we may understand from that alone how thoroughly\n prostrate they are. For on the one side are fighting modesty, on the other wantonness; on the\n one chastity, on the other uncleanness; on the one honesty, on the other fraud; on the one\n piety, on the other wickedness; on the one consistency, on the other insanity; on the one\n honour, on the other baseness; on the one continence, on the other lust; in short, equity,\n temperance, fortitude, prudence, all the virtues contend against iniquity with luxury, against\n indolence, against rashness, against all the vices; lastly, abundance contends against\n destitution, good plans against baffled designs, wisdom against madness, well-founded hope\n against universal despair. In a contest and war of this sort, even if the zeal of men were to\n fail, will not the immortal gods compel such numerous and excessive vices to be defeated by\n these most eminent virtues? ",
            "25":"\n And as this is the case, O Romans, as I have said before, defend your house with guards and\n vigilance. I have taken care and made arrangements that there shall be sufficient\n protection for the city without distressing you and without any tumult. All the colonists and\n citizens of your municipal towns, being informed by me of this nocturnal sally of Catiline,\n will easily defend their cities and territories; the gladiators which he thought would be his\n most numerous and most trusty band, although they are better disposed than part of the\n patricians, will be held in cheek by our power. Quintus Metellus, whom I, making provision for\n this, sent on to the Gallic and Picenian territory, will either overwhelm the man, or will\n prevent all his motions and attempts; but with respect to the arrangement of all other matters,\n and maturing and acting on our plans, we shall consult the senate, which, as you are aware, is\n convened. ",
            "26":"\n \n Now once more I wish those who have remained in the city, and who, contrary to the safety of\n the city and of all of you, have been left in the city by Catiline, although they are enemies,\n yet because they were born citizens, to be warned again and again by me. If my lenity has\n appeared to any one too remiss, it has been only waiting that that might break out which was\n lying hid. As to the future, I cannot now forget that this is my country, that I am the consul\n of these citizens; that I must either live with them, or die for them. There is no guard at the\n gate, no one plotting against their path; if any one wishes to go, he can provide for himself;\n but if any one stirs in the city, and if I detect not only any action, but any attempt or\n design against the country, he shall feel that there are in this city vigilant consuls, eminent\n magistrates, a brave senate, arms, and prisons; which our ancestors appointed as the avengers\n of nefarious and convicted crimes. ",
            "27":"\n And all this shall be so done, O Romans, that affairs of the greatest importance shall be\n transacted with the least possible disturbance; the greatest dangers shall be avoided without\n any tumult; an internal civil war the most cruel and terrible in the memory of man, shall be\n put an end to by me alone in the robe of peace acting as general and commander-in-chief. And\n this I will so arrange, O Romans, that if it can be by any means managed, even the most\n worthless man shall not suffer the punishment of his crimes in this city. But if the violence\n of open audacity, if danger impending over the republic drives me of necessity from this\n merciful disposition, at all events I will manage this, which seems scarcely even to be hoped\n for in so great and so treacherous a war, that no good man shall fall, and that you may all be\n saved by the punishment of a few. ",
            "28":"\n \n And I promise you this, O Romans, relying neither on my own prudence, nor on human counsels,\n but on many and manifest intimations of the will of the immortal gods; under whose guidance I\n first entertained this hope and this opinion; who are now defending their temples and the\n houses of the city, not afar off, as they were used to, from a foreign and distant enemy, but\n here on the spot, by their own divinity and present help. And you, O Romans, ought to pray to\n and implore them to defend from the nefarious wickedness of abandoned citizens, now that all\n the forces of all enemies are defeated by land and sea, this city which they have ordained to\n be the most beautiful and flourishing of all cities."

            "0":"\n You see this day, O Romans, the republic, and all your lives, your goods, your fortunes, your\n wives and children, this home of most illustrious empire, thus most fortunate and beautiful\n city, by the great love of the immortal gods for you, by my labours and counsels and dangers,\n snatched from fire and sword, and almost from the very jaws of fate, and preserved and restored\n to you.",
            "1":" And if those days on which we are preserved are not less\n pleasant to us, or less illustrious, than those on which we are born, because the joy of being\n saved is certain, the good fortune of being born uncertain, and because we are born without\n feeling it, but we are preserved with great delight; yes; since we have, by our affection and\n by our good report, raised to the immortal gods that Romulus who built this city, he, too, who\n has preserved this city, built by him, and embellished as you see it, ought to be held in\n terror by you and your posterity; for we have extinguished flames which were almost laid under\n and placed around the temples and shrines, and houses and walls of the whole city; we have\n turned the edge of swords drawn against the republic, and have turned aside their points from\n your throats.",
            "2":" And since all this has been displayed in the\n senate, and made manifest, and detected by me, I will now explain it briefly, that you, O\n citizens, that are as yet ignorant of it, and are in suspense, may be able to see how great the\n danger was, how evident and by what means it was detected and arrested. First of all, since\n Catiline, a few days ago, burst out of the city, when he had left behind the companions of his\n wickedness, the active leaders of this infamous war, I have continually watched and taken care,\n O Romans, of the means by which we might be safe amid such great and such carefully concealed\n treachery. \n Further, when I drove Catiline out of the city, (for I do not fear the unpopularity of this\n expression, when that is more to be feared that I should be blamed because he has departed\n alive,) but then when I wished him to be removed, I thought either that the rest of the band of\n conspirators would depart with him, or that they who remained would be weak and powerless\n without him.

            "3":"\n And I, as I saw that those whom I knew to be inflamed with the greatest madness and\n wickedness were among us, and had remained at Rome, spent ail my nights and days in taking care\n to know and see what they were doing, and what they were contriving that, since what I said\n would, from the incredible enormity of the wickedness, make less impression on your ears, I\n might so detect the whole business that you might with all your hearts provide for your safety,\n when you saw the crime with your own eyes. Therefore, when I found that the ambassadors of the\n Allobroges had been tampered with by Publius Lentulus, for the sake of exciting a Transalpine\n war and commotion in Gaul, and that they, on their return to Gaul, had been sent with letters\n and messages to Catiline on the same road, and that Vulturcius had been added to them as a\n companion, and that he too had had letters given him for Catiline, I thought that an\n opportunity wits given me of contriving what was most difficult, and which I was always wishing\n the immortal gods might grant, that the whole business might be manifestly detected not by me\n alone, but by the senate also, and by you. ",
            "4":"\n \n Therefore, yesterday I summoned Lucius Flaccus and C. Pomtinus, the praetors, brave men and\n well-affected to the republic. I explained to them the whole matter, and showed them what I\n wished to have done. But they, full of noble and worthy sentiments towards the republic,\n without hesitation, and without any delay, undertook the business, and when it was evening,\n went secretly to the Mulvian bridge, and there so distributed themselves in the nearest villas,\n that the Tiber and the bridge was between them. And they took to the same place, without any\n one having the least suspicion of it, many brave men, and I had sent many picked young men of\n the prefecture of Reate, whose assistance I constantly employ in the protection of the\n republic, armed with swords. ",
            "5":" In the meantime, about the end\n of the third watch, when the ambassadors of the Allobroges, with a great retinue and Vulturcius\n with them, began to come upon the Mulvian bridge, an attack is made upon them; swords are drawn\n both by them and by our people; the matter was understood by the praetors alone, but was\n unknown to the rest. \n Then, by the intervention of Pomtinus and Flaccus, the fight which had begun was put an end\n to; all the letters which were in the hands of the whole company are delivered to the praetors\n with time seals unbroken; the men themselves are arrested and brought to me at daybreak. And I\n immediately summoned that most worthless contriver of all this wickedness, Gabinius, as yet\n suspecting nothing; after him, P. Statilius is sent for, and after him Cethegus; but Lentulus\n was a long time in coming,—I suppose, because, contrary to his custom, he had been up a long\n time the night before, writing letters. ",
            "6":"\n \n But when those most noble and excellent men of the whole city, who, hearing of the matter,\n came in crowds to me in the morning, thought it best for me to open the letters before I\n related the matter to the senate, lest, if nothing were found in them, so great a disturbance\n might seem to have been caused to the state for nothing, I said I would never so act as shrink\n from referring matter of public danger to the public council. In truth if, O Romans, these\n things which had been reported to me had not been found in them, yet I did not think I ought,\n in such a crisis of the republic, to be afraid of the imputation of over-diligence.

            "7":" I quickly summoned a full senate, as you saw; and meantime, without any\n delay, by the advice of the Allobroges, I sent Caius Sulpicius the praetor, a brave man, to\n bring whatever arms he could find in the house of Cethegus, whence he did bring a great number\n of swords and daggers. \n I introduced Vulturcius without the Gauls. By the command of the senate, I pledged him the\n public faith for his safety. I exhorted him fearlessly to tell all he knew. Then, when he had\n scarcely recovered himself from his great alarm, he said: that he had messages and letters for\n Catiline, from Publius Lentulus, to avail himself of the guard of the slaves, and to come\n towards the city with his army as quickly as possible; and that was to be done with the\n intention that, when they had set fire to the city on all sides as it had been arranged and\n distributed, and had made a great massacre of the citizens, he might be at hand to catch those\n who fled, and to join himself to the leaders within the city. ",
            "8":"\n But the Gauls being introduced, said that an oath had been administered to them,\n and letters given them by Publius Lentulus, Cethegus, and Statilius, for their nation; and that\n they had been enjoined by them, and by Lucius Cassius, to send cavalry into Italy as early as\n possible; that infantry should not be wanting; and that Lentulus had assured him, from the\n Sibylline oracles and the answers of soothsayers, that he was that third Cornelius to whom the\n kingdom and sovereignty over this city was fated to come; that Cinna and Sulla had been before\n him; and that he had also said that was the year destined to the destruction of this city and\n empire, being the tenth year after the acquittal of the virgins, and the twentieth after the\n burning of the Capitol. ",
            "9":" But they said there had been this\n dispute between Cethegus and the rest,—that Lentulus and others thought it best that the\n massacre should take place and the city be burnt at the Saturnalia, but that Cethegus thought\n it too long to wait. \n And, not to detain you, O Romans, we ordered the letters to be brought forward which were\n said to have been given them by each of the men. First I showed his seal to Cethegus; he\n recognised it: we cut the thread; we read the letter. It was written with his own hand: that he\n would do for the senate and people of the Allobroges what he had promised their ambassadors;\n and that he begged them also to do what their ambassadors had arranged. Then Cethegus, who a\n little before had made answer about the swords and daggers which had been found in his house,\n and had said that he had always been fond of fine arms, being stricken down and dejected at the\n reading of his letters, convicted by his own conscience, became suddenly silent. Statilius,\n being introduced, owned his handwriting and his seal. His letters were read, of nearly the same\n tenor: he confessed it. Then I showed Lentulus his letters, and asked him whether he recognised\n the seal? He nodded assent. But it is, said I, a well-known seal;—the likeness of your\n grandfather, a most illustrious man, who greatly loved his country and his fellow-citizens; and\n it even though silent, ought to have called you back from such wickedness. ",
            "10":"\n \n Letters are read of the same tenor to the senate and people of the Allobroges. I offered him\n leave, if he wished to say anything of these matters: and at first he declined to speak; but a\n little afterwards, when the whole examination had been gone through and concluded, he rose. He\n asked the Gauls what he had had to do with them? why they had come to his house? and he asked\n Vulturcius too. And when they had answered him briefly and steadily, under whose guidance they\n had come to him, and how often; and when they asked him whether he had said nothing to them\n about the Sibylline oracles, then he on a sudden, mad with wickedness, showed how great was the\n power of conscience; for though he might have denied it, he suddenly, contrary to every one's\n expectation confessed it: so not only did his genius and skill in oratory, for which he was\n always eminent, but even through the power of his manifest and detected wickedness, that\n impudence in which he surpassed all men, and audacity deserted him.",
            "11":" But Vulturcius on a sudden ordered the letters to be\n produced and opened which he said had been given to him for Catiline, by Lentulus. And though\n Lentulus was greatly agitated at that, yet he acknowledged his seal and his handwriting; but\n the letter was anonymous, and ran thus:—“Who I am you will know from him whom I have sent to\n you: take care to behave like a man, and consider to what place you have proceeded, and provide\n for what is now necessary for you: take care to associate to yourself the assistance of every\n one, even of the powerless.” Then Gabinius being introduced, when at first he had begun to\n answer impudently, at last denied nothing of those things which the Gauls alleged against him.\n ",
            "12":" And to me, indeed, O Romans, though the letters, the seals,\n the handwriting, and the confession of each individual seemed most certain indications and\n proofs of wickedness, yet their colour, their eyes, their countenance, their silence, appeared\n more certain still; for they stood so stupefied, they kept their eyes so fixed on the ground,\n at times looking stealthily at one another, that they appeared now not so much to be informed\n against by others as to be informing against themselves. \n Having produced and divulged these proofs, O Romans, I consulted the senate what ought to be\n done for the interests of the republic. Vigorous and fearless opinions were delivered by the\n chief men, which the senate adopted without any variety; and since the decree of the senate is\n not yet written out, I will relate to you from memory, O citizens, what the senate has decreed.\n ",
            "13":" First of all, a vote of thanks to me is passed in the most\n honourable words, because the republic has been delivered from the greatest dangers by my\n valour and wisdom, and prudence. Then Lucius Flaccus and Caius Pomtinus, the\n praetors, are deservedly and rightly praised, because I had availed myself of their brave and\n loyal assistance. And also, praise is given to that brave man, my colleague, because he had\n removed from his counsels, and from the counsels of the republic, these who had been\n accomplices in this conspiracy. And they voted that Publius Lentulus, when he had abdicated the\n praetorship, should be given into custody; and also, that Caius Cethegus, Lucius Statilius,\n Publius Gabinius, who were all present, should be given into custody: and the same decree was\n passed against Lucius Cassius, who had begged for himself the office of burning the city;\n against Marcus Caparius, to whom it had been proved that Apulia had been allotted for the\n purpose of exciting disaffection among the shepherds; against Publius Furius, who belongs to\n the colonies which Lucius Sulla led to Faesulae; against Quintus Manlius Chilo, who was always\n associated with this man Furius in his tampering with the Allobroges; against Publius Umbrenus,\n a freedman, by whom it was proved that the Gauls were originally brought to Gabinius. \n And the senate, O citizens, acted with such lenity, that, out of so great a conspiracy, and\n such a number and multitude of domestic enemies, it thought that since the republic was saved,\n the minds of the rest might be restored to a healthy state by the punishment of nine most\n abandoned men. ",
            "14":" And also a supplication was decreed in my name, (which is the first time since the building of\n the city that such an honour has ever been paid to a man in a civil capacity,) to the immortal\n gods, for their singular kindness. And it was decreed in these words, “because I had delivered\n the city from conflagrations, the citizens from massacre, and Italy from war.” And if this\n supplication be compared with others, O citizens, there is this difference between them,—that\n all others have been appointed because of the successes of the republic; this one alone for its\n preservation. And that which was the first thing to be done, has been done and executed; for\n Publius Lentulus, though, being convicted by proofs and, by his own confession, by the judgment\n of the senate he had lost not only the rights of a praetor but also those of a citizen, still\n resigned his office; so that though Caius Marcius, that most illustrious of men, had no\n scruples about putting to death Caius Glaucius the praetor against whom nothing had been\n decreed by name, still we are relieved from that scruple in the case of Publius Lentulus, who\n is now a private individual. ",
            "15":"\n Now, since, O citizens you have the nefarious leaders of this most wicked and dangerous war\n taken prisoners and in your grasp, you ought to think that all the resources of Catiline,—all\n his hopes and all his power, now that these dangers of the city are warded off, have fallen to\n pieces. And, indeed, when I drove him from the city I foresaw in my mind, O citizens, that if\n Catiline were removed, I had no cause to fear either the drowsiness of Publius Lentulus, or the\n fat of Lucius Cassius, or the mad rashness of Cassius Cethegus. He alone was to be feared of\n all these men, and that, only as long as he was within the walls of the city. He knew\n everything, he had access to everybody. He had the skill and the audacity to address, to tempt\n and to tamper with every one. He had acuteness suited to crime; and neither tongue nor hand\n ever failed to support that acuteness. Already he had men he could rely on chosen and\n distributed for the execution of all other business and when he had ordered anything to be done\n he did not think it was done on that account. There was nothing to which he did not personally\n attend and see to,—for which he did not watch and toil. He was able to endure cold, thirst, and\n hunger. ",
            "16":"\n Unless I had driven this man, so active, so ready, so audacious, so crafty, so vigilant in\n wickedness, so industrious in criminal exploits, from his plots within the city to the open\n warfare of the camp, (I will express my honest opinion, O citizens,) I should not easily have\n removed from your necks so vast a weight of evil. He would not have determined on the\n Saturnalia to massacre you he would\n not have announced the destruction of the republic, and even the day of its doom\n so long beforehand,—he would never have allowed his seal and his letters, the undeniable\n witnesses of his guilt, to be taken, which now, since he is absent, has been so done that no\n larceny in a private house has ever been so thoroughly and clearly detected as this vast\n conspiracy against the republic. But if Catiline had remained in the city to this day,\n although, as long as he was so, I met all his designs and withstood them; yet, to say the\n least, we should have had to fight with him, and should never, while he remained as an enemy in\n the city, have delivered the republic from such dangers, with such ease, such tranquillity, and\n such silence. ",
            "17":"\n Although all these things, O Romans, have been so managed by men that they appear to have\n been done and provided for by the order and design of the immortal gods; and as we may\n conjecture this because the direction of such weighty affairs scarcely appears capable of\n having been carried out by human wisdom; so, too, they have at this time so brought us present\n aid and assistance, that we could almost behold them without eyes. For to say nothing of those\n things, namely, the firebrands seen in the west in the night time, and the heat of the\n atmosphere,—to pass over the falling of thunderbolts and the earthquakes,—to say nothing of all\n the other portents which have taken place in such number during my consulship, that the\n immortal gods themselves have been seeming to predict what is now taking place; yet, at all\n events, this which I am about to mention, O Romans, must be neither passed over nor omitted.\n ",
            "18":"\n \n For you recollect, I suppose, when Cotta and Torquatus were consuls, that many towers in the\n Capitol were struck with lightning, when both the images of the immortal gods were moved, and\n the statues of many ancient men were thrown down, and the brazen tablets on which the laws were\n written were melted. Even Romulus, who built this city, was struck, which, you recollect, stood\n in the Capitol, a gilt statue, little and sucking, and clinging to the teats of the wolf. And\n when at this time the soothsayers were assembled out of all Etruria, they said that slaughter,\n and conflagration, and the overthrow of the laws, and civil and domestic war, and the fall of\n the whole city and empire was at hand, unless the immortal gods, being appeased in every\n possible manner, by their own power turned aside, as I may say, the very fates themselves.\n ",
            "19":"\n \n Therefore, according to their answers, games were celebrated for ten days, nor was anything\n omitted which might tend to the appeasing of the gods. And they enjoined also that we should\n make a greater statue of Jupiter, and place it in a lofty situation, and (contrary to what had\n been done before) turn it towards the east. And they said that they hoped that if that statue\n which you now behold looked upon the rising of the sun, and the forum, and the senate-house,\n that those designs which were secretly formed against the safety of the city and empire would\n be brought to light so as to be able to be thoroughly seen by the senate and by the Roman\n people. And the consuls ordered it to be so placed; but so great was the delay in the work,\n that it was never set up by the former consuls nor by us before this day. ",
            "20":" Here who, O Romans can there be so obstinate against the\n truth, so headstrong, so void of sense, as to deny that all these things which we see, and\n especially this city, is governed by the divine authority and power of the immortal gods?\n Forsooth, when this answer had been given, that massacre, and conflagration, and ruin was\n prepared for the republic; and that, too, by profligate citizens, which, from the enormity of\n the wickedness, appeared incredible to some people, you found that it had not only been planned\n by wicked citizens, but had even been undertaken and commenced. And is not this fact so present\n that it appears to have taken place by the express will of the good and mighty Jupiter, that,\n when this day, early in the morning, both the conspirators and their accusers were being led by\n my command through the forum to the Temple of Concord, at that very time the statue was being\n erected? And when it was set up and turned towards you and towards the senate the senate and\n you yourselves saw everything which had been planned against the universal safety brought to\n light and made manifest.",
            "21":" And on this account they deserve even greater hatred and\n greater punishment, for having attempted to apply their fatal and wicked fire, not only to your\n houses and homes, but even to the shrines and temples of the Gods. And if I were to say that it\n was I who resisted them, I should take too much to myself and ought not to be borne. He—he,\n Jupiter, resisted them, He determined that the Capitol should be safe, he saved these temples,\n he saved this city, he saved all of you. It is under the guidance of the immortal\n gods, O Romans, that I have cherished the intention and desires which I have, and have arrived\n at such undeniable proofs. Surely, that tampering with the Allobroges would never have taken\n place, so important a matter would never have been so madly entrusted, by Lentulus and the rest\n of our internal enemies, to strangers and foreigners, such letters would never have been\n written, unless all prudence had been taken by the immortal gods from such terrible audacity.\n What shall I say? That Gauls, men from a state scarcely at peace with us, the only nation\n existing which seems both to be able to make war on the Roman people, and not to be unwilling\n to do so,—that they should disregard the hope of empire and of the greatest success voluntarily\n offered to them by patricians; and should prefer your safety to their own power—do you not\n think that that was caused by divine interposition? especially when they could have destroyed\n us, not by fighting, but by keeping silence. ",
            "22":"\n Wherefore, O citizens, since a supplication has been decreed at all the altars, celebrate\n those days with your wives and children; for many just and deserved honours have been often\n paid to the immortal gods, but juster ones never. For you have been snatched from a most cruel\n and miserable destruction, and you have been snatched from it without slaughter, without\n bloodshed, without an army, without a battle. You have conquered in the garb of peace, with me\n in the garb of peace for your only general and commander.",
            "23":" Remember, O citizens, all civil dissensions, and not only\n those which you have heard of but these also which you yourselves remember and have seen.\n Lucius Sulla crushed Publius Sulpicius ; he drove from the city Caius Marius the\n guardian of this city; and of many other brave men some he drove from the city, and some he\n murdered. Cnaeus Octavius the consul drove his colleague by force of arms out of the city; all\n this place was crowded with heaps of carcasses and flowed with the blood of citizens;\n afterwards Cinna and Marius got the upper hand; and then most illustrious men were put to\n death, and the spirits of the state were extinguished. Afterwards Sulla avenged the cruelty of\n this victory; it is needless to say with what a diminution of the citizens and with what\n disasters to the republic Marcus Lepidus disagreed with that most eminent and brave man\n Quintus, Catulus. His death did not cause as much grief to the republic as that of the others. \n ",
            "24":" And these dissensions, O Romans, were such as concerned not\n the destruction of the republic, but only a change in the constitution. They did not wish that\n there should be no republic, but that they themselves should be the chief men in that which\n existed; nor did they desire that the city should be burnt, but that they themselves should\n flourish in it. And yet all those dissensions, none of which aimed at the destruction of the\n republic, were such that they were to be terminated not by a reconciliation and concord, but\n only by internecine war among the citizens. But in this war alone, the greatest and most cruel\n in the memory of man,—a war such as even the countries of the barbarians have never waged with\n their own tribes,—a war in which this law was laid down by Lentulus, and Catiline, and Cassius\n and Cethegus that every one, who could live in safety as long as the city remained in safety,\n should be considered as an enemy, in this war I have so managed matters, O Romans that you\n should all be preserved in safety; and though your enemies had thought that only such a number\n of the citizens would be left as had held out against an interminable massacre and only so much\n of the city as the flames could not devour, I have preserved both the city and the citizens\n unhurt and undiminished. ",
            "25":" And for these exploits, important as they are, O Romans, I\n ask from you no reward of virtue, no badge of honour, no monument of my glory, beyond the\n everlasting recollection of this day. In your minds I wish all my triumphs, all my decorations\n of honour; the monuments of my glory, the badges of my renown, to be stored and laid up.\n Nothing voiceless can delight me, nothing silent,—nothing, in short, such as even those who are\n less worthy can obtain. In your memory, O Romans, my name shall be cherished, in your\n discourses it shall grow, in the monuments of your letters it shall grow old and strengthen;\n and I feel assured that the same day which I hope will be for everlasting; will\n be remembered for ever, so as to tend both to the safety of the city and the recollection of my\n consulship; and that it will be remembered that there existed in this city at the same time two\n citizens, one of whom limited the boundaries of your empire only by the regions of heaven, not\n by those of the earth, while the other preserved the abode and home of that same empire.\n ",
            "26":"\n But since the fortune and condition of those exploits which I have performed is not the same\n with that of those men who have directed foreign wars—because I must live among those whom I\n have defeated and subdued, they have left their enemies either slain or crushed,—it is your\n business, O Romans, to take care, if their good deeds are a benefit to others, that mine shall\n never be an injury to me. For that the wicked and profligate designs of audacious men shall not\n be able to injure you, I have taken care; it is your business to take care that they do not\n injure me. Although, O Romans, no injury can be done to me by them,—for there is a great\n protection in the affection of all good men, which is procured for me for ever; there is great\n dignity in the republic, which will always silently defend me; there is great power in\n conscience, and those who neglect it when they desire to attack me will destroy themselves.\n ",
            "27":"\n \n There is moreover that disposition in me, O Romans, that I not only will yield to the\n audacity of no one, but that I always voluntarily attack the worthless. And if all the violence\n of domestic enemies being warded off from you turns itself upon me alone, you will have to take\n care, O Roman; in what condition you wish those men to be for the future, who for your safety\n have exposed themselves to unpopularity and to all sorts of dangers. As for me, myself; what is\n there which now can be gained by me for the enjoyment of life, especially when neither in\n credit among you, nor in the glory of virtue, do I see any higher point to which I can be\n desirous to climb? ",
            "28":"\n \n That indeed I will take care of; O Romans, as a private man to uphold and embellish the\n exploits which I have performed in my consulship: so that if there has been any unpopularity\n incurred in preserving the republic, it may injure those who envy me, and may tend to my glory.\n Lastly, I will so behave myself in the republic as always to remember what I have done, and to\n take care that they shall appear to have been done through virtue, and not by chance. Do you, O\n Romans, since it is now night ,worship that Jupiter, the guardian of this city and of\n yourselves, and depart to your homes; and defend those homes, though the danger is now removed,\n with guard and watch as you did last night, That you shall not have to do so long, and that you\n shall enjoy perpetual tranquillity, shall, O Romans, be my care."

Your good-will is delightful to one amid evils, and pleasing amid grief;\n but I entreat you, in the name of the immortal gods, lay it aside now, and, forgetting my\n safety, think of yourselves and of your children. If indeed, this condition of the consulship\n has been allotted to me, that I should bear all bitterness, all pains and tortures, I will bear\n them not only bravely but even cheerfully, provided that by my toils dignity and safety are\n procured for you and for the Roman people.",
            "1":" I am that consul, O conscript fathers, to whom neither the\n forum in which all justice is contained, nor the Campus Martius, consecrated to the consular assemblies,\n nor the senate house, the chief assistance of all nations, nor my own home, the common refuge\n of all men, nor my bed devoted to rest, in short, not even this seat of honour, this curule\n chair has ever been free from the danger of death, or from plots and treachery. I have been\n silent about many things, I have borne much, I have conceded much, I have remedied many things\n with some pain to myself amid the alarm of you all. Now if the immortal gods have determined\n that there shall be this end to my consulship that I should snatch you, O conscript fathers,\n and the Roman people from miserable slaughter, your wives and children and the vestal virgins\n from most bitter distress, the temples and shrines of the gods and this most lovely country of\n all of us, from impious flames, all Italy from war and devastation, then whatever fortune is\n laid up for me by myself it shall be borne. If, indeed, Publius Lentulus, being led on by\n soothsayers believed that his name was connected by destiny with the destruction of the\n republic, why should not I rejoice that my consulship has taken place almost by the express\n appointment of fate for the preservation of the republic? ",
            "2":"\n Wherefore, O conscript fathers, consult the welfare of yourselves, provide for that of the\n republic; preserve yourselves, your wives, your children, and your fortunes; defend the name\n and safety of the Roman people; cease to spare me, and to think of me. For, in the first place,\n I ought to hope that all the gods who preside over this city will show me gratitude in\n proportion as I deserve it; and in the second place, if anything does happen to me, I shall\n fall with a contented and prepared mind; and, indeed, death cannot be disgraceful to a brave\n man, nor premature to one of consular rank, nor miserable to a wise man. Not that I am a man of\n so iron a disposition as not to be moved by the grief of a most dear and affectionate brother\n now present, and by the tears of all these men by whom you now see me surrounded. Nor does my\n fainting wife, my daughter prostrate with fear, and my little son whom the republic seems to me\n to embrace as a sort of hostage for my consulship, the son-in-law who, awaiting the end of that\n day, is now standing in my sight, fail often to recall my mind to my home. I am moved by all\n these circumstances, but in such a direction as to wish that they all may be safe together with\n you, even if some violence overwhelms me, rather than that both they and are should perish\n together with the republic.",
            "3":" Wherefore, O conscript fathers, attend to the safety of the\n republic; look round upon all the storms which are impending, unless you guard against them.

They are now in your hands who withstood all Rome, with\n the object of bringing conflagration on the whole city, massacre on all of you, and of\n receiving Catiline; their letters are in your possession, their seals, their handwriting, and\n the confession of each individual of them; the Allobroges are tampered with, the slaves are\n excited, Catiline is sent for; the design is actually begun to be put in execution, that all\n should be put to death, so that no one should be left even to mourn the name of the republic,\n and to lament over the downfall of so mighty a dominion.

            "4":"\n All these things the witnesses have informed you of; the prisoners have confessed, you by\n many judgments have already decided; first, because you have thanked me in unprecedented\n language, and have passed a vote that the conspiracy of abandoned men has been laid open by my\n virtue and diligence; secondly, because you have compelled Publius Lentulus to abdicate the\n praetorship; again, because you have voted that he and the others about whom you have decided\n should be given into custody; and above all because you have decreed a supplication in my name,\n an honour which has never been paid to any one before acting in a civil capacity; last of all\n because yesterday you gave most ample rewards to the ambassadors of the Allobroges and to Titus\n Vulturcius; all which acts are such that they, who have been given into custody by name,\n without any doubt seem already condemned by you.

            "5":"\n \n But I have determined to refer the business to you as a fresh matter, O conscript fathers,\n both as to the fact, what you think of it and as to the punishment, what you vote.

I have seen for a long time great madness existing in the\n republic, and new designs being formed, and evil passions being stirred up; but I never thought\n that so great, so destructive a conspiracy as this was being meditated by citizens. Now to\n whatever point your minds and opinions incline, you must decide before night. You see how great\n a crime has been made known to you; if you think that but few are implicated in it you are\n greatly mistaken; this evil has spread wider than you think; it has spread not only throughout\n Italy, but it has even crossed the Alps, and creeping stealthily on, it has already occupied\n many of the provinces; it can by no means be crushed by tolerating it, and by temporising with\n it; however you determine on chastising it, you must act with promptitude. ",
            "6":"\n I see that as yet there are two opinions. One that of Decius Silanus, who thinks that those\n who have endeavoured to destroy all these things should be punished with death the other, that\n of Caius Caesar, who objects to the punishment of death, but adopts the most extreme severity\n of all other punishment. Each acts in a manner suitable to his own dignity and to the magnitude\n of the business with the greatest severity. The one thinks that it is not right that those, who\n have attempted to deprive all or us and the while Roman people of life, to destroy the empire,\n to extinguish the name of the Roman people, should enjoy life and the breath of heaven common\n to us all, for one moment; and he remembers that this sort of punishment has often been\n employed against worthless citizens in this republic. The other feels that death was not\n appointed by the immortal gods for the sake of punishment, but that it is either a necessity of\n nature, or a rest from toils and miseries; therefore wise men have never met it unwillingly,\n brave men have often encountered it even voluntarily. But imprisonment and that too perpetual,\n was certainly invented for the extraordinary punishment of nefarious wickedness; therefore he\n proposes that they should be distributed among the municipal towns. This proposition seems to\n have in it injustice if you command; it difficulty if you request it. ",
            "7":"\n \n Let it, however, be so decreed if you like. For I will undertake, and, as I hope, I shall\n find one who will not think it suitable to his dignity to refuse what you decide on for the\n sake of the universal safety. He imposes besides a severe punishment on the burgesses of the\n municipal town if any of the prisoners escape; he surrounds them with the most terrible guard,\n and with everything worthy of the wickedness of abandoned men. And he proposes to establish a\n decree that no one shall be able to alleviate the punishment of those whom he is condemning by\n a vote of either the senate or the people. He takes away even hope, which alone can comfort men\n in their miseries; besides this, he votes that their goods should be confiscated; he leaves\n life alone to these infamous men, and if he had taken that away; he would have\n relieved them by one pang of many tortures of mind and body, and of all the punishment of their\n crimes. Therefore, that there might be some dread in life to the wicked, men of old have\n believed that there were some punishments of that sort appointed for the wicked in the shades\n below; because in truth they perceived that if this were taken away death itself would not be\n terrible.

            "8":"\n Now, O conscript fathers, I see what is my interest; if you follow the opinion of Caius\n Caesar, (since he has adopted this path in the republic which is accounted the popular one,)\n perhaps since he is the author and promoter of this opinion, the popular violence will be less\n to be dreaded by me; if you adopt the other opinion, I know not whether I am not likely to have\n more trouble; but still let the advantage of the republic outweigh the consideration of my\n danger. For we have from Caius Caesar, as his own dignity and as the illustrious character of\n his ancestors demanded, a vote as a hostage of his lasting good-will to the republic; it has\n been clearly seen how great is the difference between the lenity of demagogues, and a\n disposition really attached to the interests of the people. ",
            "9":"\n I see that of those men who wish to be considered attached to the people one man is absent,\n that they may not seem forsooth to give a vote about the lives of Roman citizens. He only three\n days ago gave Roman citizens into custody, and decreed me a supplication, and voted most\n magnificent rewards to the witnesses only yesterday. It is not now doubtful to any one what he,\n who voted for the imprisonment of the criminals, congratulation to him who had detected them,\n and rewards to those who had proved the crime, thinks of the whole matter, and of the cause.\n But Caius Caesar considers that the Sempronian law\n was passed about Roman citizens, but that he who is an enemy of the republic can by no means be\n a citizen; and moreover that the very proposer of the Sempronian law suffered punishment by the\n command of the people. He also denies that Lentulus, a briber and a spendthrift, after he has\n formed such cruel and bitter plans about the destruction of the Roman people and the ruin of\n this city, can be called a friend of the people. Therefore this most gentle and merciful man\n does not hesitate to commit Publius Lentulus to eternal darkness and imprisonment, and\n establishes a law to all posterity that no one shall be able to boast of alleviating his\n punishment or hereafter to appear a friend of the people to the destruction of the Roman\n people. He adds also the confiscation of their goods, so that want also and beggary may be\n added to all the torments of mind and body. ",
            "10":"\n Wherefore, if you decide on this you give me a companion in my address, dear and acceptable\n to the Roman people; or if you prefer to adopt the opinion of Silanus, you will easily defend\n me and yourselves from the reproach of cruelty, and I will prevail that it shall be much\n lighter. Although, O conscript fathers, what cruelty can there be in chastising the enormity of\n such excessive wickedness? For I decide from my own feeling. For so may I be allowed; to enjoy\n the republic in safety in your company, as I am not moved to be somewhat vehement in this cause\n by any severity of disposition, (for who is more merciful than I am?) but rather by a singular\n humanity and mercifulness. For I seem to myself to see this city, the light of the world and\n the citadel of all nations, falling on a sudden by one conflagration. I see in my mind's eye\n miserable and unburied heaps of cities in my buried country; the sight of Cethegus and his\n madness raging amid your slaughter is ever present to my sight. ",
            "11":" But when I have set before myself Lentulus reigning, as he himself confesses\n that he had hoped was his destiny, and this Gabinius arrayed in the purple and Catiline arrived\n with his army, then I shudder at the lamentation of matrons, and the flight of virgins and of\n boys and the insults of the vestal virgins; and because these things appear to me exceedingly\n miserable and pitiable, therefore I show myself severe and rigorous to those who have wished to\n bring about this state of things. I ask, forsooth, if any father of a family, supposing his\n children had been slain by a slave, his wife murdered, his house burnt, were not to inflict on\n his slaves the severest possible punishment would he appear clement and merciful or most\n inhuman and cruel? To me he would seem unnatural and hard-hearted who did not soothe his own\n pain and anguish by the pain and torture of the criminal. And so we, in the case\n of these men who desired to murder us, and our wives, and our children,—who endeavoured to\n destroy the houses of every individual among us, and also the republic, the home of all,—who\n designed to place the nation of the Allobroges on the relics of this city, and on the ashes of\n the empire destroyed by fire;—if we are very rigorous, we shall be considered merciful; if we\n choose to be lax, we must endure the character of the greatest cruelty, to the damage of our\n country and our fellow-citizens. ",
            "12":" Unless, indeed, Lucius Caesar, a thoroughly brave man\n and of the best disposition towards the republic, seemed to any one to be too cruel three, days\n ago, when he said that the husband of his own sister, a most excellent woman, (in his presence\n and in his hearing,) ought to be deprived of life,— when he said that his grandfather had been\n put to death by command of the consul and his youthful son, sent as an ambassador by his\n father, had been put to death in prison. And what deed had they done like these men? had they\n formed any plan for destroying the republic? At that time great corruption was rife in the\n republic, and there was the greatest strife between parties. And, at that time, the grandfather\n of this Lentulus, a most illustrious man, put on his armour and pursued Gracchus; he even\n received a severe wound that there might be no diminution of the great dignity of the republic.\n But this man, his grandson, invited the Gauls to overthrow the foundations of the republic; he\n stirred up the slaves, he summoned Catiline, he distributed us to Cethegus to be massacred, and\n the rest of the citizens to Gabinius to be assassinated, the city he allotted to Cassius to\n burn, and the plundering and devastating of all Italy he assigned to Catiline. You fear, I\n think, lest in the case of such unheard of and abominable wickedness you should seem to decide\n anything with too great severity; when we ought much more to fear lest by being remiss in\n punishing we should appear cruel to our country, rather than appear by the severity of our\n irritation too rigorous to its most bitter enemies. ",
            "13":"\n But O conscript fathers, I cannot conceal what I hear; for sayings are bruited about, which\n come to my ears, of those men who seem to fear that I may not have force enough to put in\n execution the things which you determine on this day. Everything is provided for, and prepared,\n and arranged, O conscript fathers, both by my exceeding care and diligence, and also by the\n still greater zeal of the Roman people for the retaining of their supreme dominion, and for the\n preserving of the fortunes of all. All men of all ranks are present, and of all ages; the forum\n is full, the temples around the forum are full, all the approaches to this place and to this\n temple are full. For this is the only cause that has ever been known since the first foundation\n of the city, in which all men were of one and the same opinion—except those, who, as they saw\n they must be ruined, preferred to perish in company with all the world rather than by\n themselves.",
            "14":" These men I except, and I willingly set apart from the\n rest; for I do not think that they should be classed in the number of worthless citizens, but\n in that of the most bitter enemies. But, as for the rest, O ye immortal gods! in what crowds,\n with what zeal, with what virtue do they agree in defence of the common dignity and safety. Why\n should I here speak of the Roman knights? who yield to you the supremacy in rank and wisdom, in\n order to vie with you in love for the republic,—whom this day and this cause now reunite with\n you in alliance and unanimity with your body reconciled after a disagreement of many years. And\n if we can preserve for ever in the republic this union now established in nay consulship, I\n pledge myself to you that no civil and domestic calamity can hereafter reach any part of the\n republic. I see that the tribunes of the treasury—excellent men—have united with similar zeal\n in defence of the republic, and all the notaries. For as this day had by chance brought them in crowds to the treasury, I see that they\n were diverted from an anxiety for the money due to them, from an expectation of their capital,\n to a regard for the common safety. ",
            "15":" The entire multitude of\n honest men, even the poorest is present; for who is there to whom these temples, the sight of\n the city, the possession of liberty,—in short; this light and this soil of his, common to us\n all, is not both dear and pleasant and delightful? \n It is worth while, O conscript fathers, to know the inclinations of the freedmen; who, having\n by their good fortune obtained the rights of citizens, consider this to be really their\n country, which some who have been born here, and born in the highest rank, have considered to\n be not their own country, but a city of enemies. But why should I speak of men of this body\n whom their private fortunes, whom their common republic, whom, in short, that liberty which is\n most delightful has called forth to defend the safety of their country? There is no slave who\n is only in an endurable condition of slavery who does not shudder at the audacity of citizens,\n who does not desire that these things may stand, who does not contribute all the good-will that\n he can, and all that he dares, to the common safety.",
            "16":" Wherefore, if this consideration moves any one, that it\n has been heard that some tool of Lentulus is running about the shops,—is hoping that the minds\n of some poor and ignorant men may be corrupted by bribery; that, indeed, has been attempted and\n begun, but no one has been found either so wretched in their fortune or so abandoned in their\n inclination as not to wish the place of their seat and work and daily gain, their chamber and\n their bed, and, in short, the tranquil course of their lives, to be still preserved to them.\n And far the greater part of those who are in the shops,—yes, indeed, (for that is the more\n correct way of speaking,) the whole of this class is of all the most attached to tranquillity;\n their whole stock, indeed, their whole employment and livelihood, exists by the peaceful\n intercourse of the citizens, and is wholly supported by peace. And if their gains are\n diminished whenever their shops are shut, what will they be when they are burnt? ",
            "17":" And, as this is the case, O conscript fathers, the protection of the\n Roman people is not wanting to you; do you take care that you do not seem to be wanting to the\n Roman people. \n You have a consul preserved out of many dangers and plots, and from death itself not for his\n own life, but for your safety. All ranks agree for the preservation of the republic with heart\n and will, with zeal, with virtue, with their voice. Your common country, besieged by the hands\n and weapons of an impious conspiracy, stretches forth her hands to you as a suppliant; to you\n she recommends herself to you she recommends the lives of all the citizens, and the citadel,\n and the Capitol, and the altars of the household gods, and the eternal inextinguishable fire of\n Vesta, and all the temples of all the gods, and the altars and the walls and the houses of the\n city. Moreover, your own lives, those of your wives and children, the fortunes of all men, your\n homes, your hearth; are this day interested in your decision.",
            "18":" You have a leader mindful of you, forgetful of himself—an\n opportunity which is not always given to men; you have all ranks, all individuals, the whole\n Roman people, (a thing which in civil transactions we see this day for the first time,) full of\n one and the same feeling. Think with what great labour this our dominion was founded, by what\n virtue this our liberty was established, by what kind favour of the gods our fortunes were\n aggrandized and ennobled, and how nearly one night destroyed them all. That this may never\n hereafter be able not only to be done, but not even to be thought of you must this day take\n care. And I have spoken thus, not in order to stir you up who almost outrun me myself but that\n my voice, which ought to be the chief voice in the republic, may appear to have fulfilled the\n duty which belongs to me as consul. ",
            "19":"\n Now, before I return to the decision, I will say a few words concerning myself. As numerous\n as is the band of conspirators—and you see that it is very great,—so numerous a multitude of\n enemies do I see that I have brought upon myself. But I consider them base and powerless and\n despicable and abject. But if at any time that band shall be excited by the wickedness and\n madness of any one, and shall show itself more powerful than your dignity and that of the\n republic, yet. O conscript fathers, I shall never repent of my actions and of my advice. Death,\n indeed, which they perhaps threaten me with, is prepared for all men; such glory during life as\n you have honoured me with by your decrees no one has ever attained to. For you have passed\n votes of congratulation to others for having governed the republic successfully, but to me\n alone for having saved it.",
            "20":" Let Scipio be thought illustrious, he by whose wisdom and\n valour Hannibal was compelled to return into Africa, and to depart from Italy. Let the second\n Africanus be extolled with conspicuous praise, who destroyed two cities most hostile to this\n empire, Carthage and Numantia. Let Lucius Paullus be thought a great man, he whose triumphal\n car was graced by Perses, previously a most powerful and noble monarch. Let\n Marius be held in eternal honour, who twice delivered Italy from siege, and from the fear of\n slavery. Let Pompey be preferred to them all—Pompey, whose exploits and whose virtues are\n bounded by the same districts and limits as the course of the sun. There will be, forsooth,\n among the praises of these men, some room for my glory, unless haply it be a greater deed to\n open to us provinces whither we may fly, than to take care that those who are at a distance\n may, when conquerors; have a home to return to. ",
            "21":"\n \n Although in one point the circumstances of foreign triumph are better than those of domestic\n victory; because foreign enemies, either if they be crushed become one's servants, or if they\n be received into the state, think themselves bound to us by obligations; but those of the\n number of citizens who become depraved by madness and once begin to be enemies to their\n country,—those men, when you have defeated their attempts to injure the republic, you can\n neither restrain by force nor conciliate by kindness. So that I see that an eternal war with\n all wicked citizens has been undertaken by me; which, however, I am confident can easily be\n driven back from me and mine by your aid, and by that of all good men, and by the memory of\n such great dangers, which will remain, not only among this people which has been saved, but in\n the discourse and minds of all nations forever. Nor, in truth, can any power be found which\n will be able to undermine and destroy your union with the Roman knights, and such unanimity as\n exists among all good men. ",
            "22":"\n As, then, this is the case, O conscript fathers, instead of my military command—instead of\n the army,——instead of the province which I have neglected, and the\n other badges of honour which have been rejected by me for the sake of protecting the city and\n your safety,—in place of the ties of clientship and hospitality with citizens in the provinces,\n which, however, by my influence in the city, I study to preserve with as much toil as I labour\n to acquire them,—in place of all these things, and in reward for my singular zeal in your\n behalf, and for this diligence in saving the republic which you behold, I ask nothing of you\n but the recollection of this time and of my whole consulship. And as long as that is fixed in\n your minds, I still think I am fenced round by the strongest wall. But if the violence of\n wicked men shall deceive and overpower my expectations, I recommend to you my little son, to\n whom, in truth, it will be protection enough, not only for his safety, but even for his dignity\n if you recollect that he is the son of him who has saved all these things at his own single\n risk. ",
            "23":"\n \n Wherefore, O conscript fathers, determine with care, as you have begun, and boldly,\n concerning your own safety, and that of the Roman people, and concerning your wives and\n children; concerning your altars and your hearths your shrines and temples; concerning the\n houses and homes of the whole city; concerning your dominion, your liberty and the safety of\n Italy and the whole republic. For you have a consul who will not hesitate to obey your decrees,\n and who will be able as long as he lives, to defend what you decide on and of his own power to\n execute it. "
