For when many of the Romans had fallen in the close contact of the lines during\n\t\t\t\t\t the infantry battle, while the ranks and standards nevertheless held their ground, the wild charge of the cavalry was heard in the rear, and at the same time the shouts of the enemy from the camp. This routed first the sixth legion, which was posted in the second line and was the first to be thrown into disorder by the Numidians; and then it routed the fifth legion and the men who were with the front-line standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t Some scattered in flight, some were slain in the centre of the battle, where Gnaeus Fulvius also fell together with eleven tribunes of the soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t How many thousand Romans and allies were slain in that battle who could state with certainty, inasmuch as in one source I find thirteen thousand, in another not more than seven?\n\t\t\t\t\t The camp and booty fell to the victor. As for Herdonea, in view of his information that it would have revolted to the Romans and would not remain loyal to him if he should withdraw, he removed the whole population to Metapontum and Thurii and set fire to the city.

To that he should add thirty ships which had been at Tarentum the previous year. With that fleet of a hundred ships, he was, if he saw fit, to cross over to Africa, to ravage the country. Likewise Publius Sulpicius' command was continued for one year, and he was to have Macedonia and Greece as his province with the same fleet as before.\n\t\t\t\t\t In regard to the two legions that had been at the city of Rome no change was made.

Crispinus, alarmed both by the death of his colleague and by his own wound, set out in the silence of the following night and in the first mountains which he reached pitched camp on a high place that was also safe on every side.\n\t\t\t\t\t There the two generals set their wits to work, the one to employ, the other to guard against, a ruse.\n\t\t\t\t\t Marcellus' ring had come into the hands of Hannibal along with the body. Fearing some trickery might be contrived by the Carthaginian through a fraudulent use of that seal, Crispinus had sent word around to the nearest city-states that his colleague had been slain and the enemy was in possession of his ring; that they should not trust any letters written in the name of Marcellus.\n\t\t\t\t\t This message of the consul had come to Salapia a little before a letter from Hannibal written in Marcellus' name arrived, saying that he would come to Salapia in the night following that day; that the soldiers on garrison duty should be ready, in case he should have any need of their services.\n\t\t\t\t\t The men of Salapia were aware of the deception, and thinking that Hannibal, out of anger not only because of their revolt, but also for the slaughter of his cavalry, was seeking an excuse for punishing them, they sent back the messenger he\n\t\t\t\t\t was, in fact, a Roman deserter that the soldiers might do what they wished unobserved. And they posted men of the town along the walls and at favourable positions in the city in detachments on guard duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t For that night they established guard-lines and sentries with more than usual care. Around the gate by which they thought the enemy would come they drew up the best men in the garrison. Hannibal approached the city about the fourth watch.\n\t\t\t\t\t At the head of the column were the Roman deserters, and they had Roman arms. When they came up to the gate, all of them, speaking Latin, called out to the sentinels and bade them open the gate.\n\t\t\t\t\t The consul, they said, was coming. The sentries, pretending to have been awakened by their outcry, were in a turmoil, excited and labouring to open the gate. The portcullis had been closed. Some raised it with levers, some hoisted it with ropes, just high enough for men to pass under it upright.\n\t\t\t\t\t Hardly had the way been quite cleared, when the deserters vied with each other in dashing through the gate. And when about six hundred had entered and the rope by which it was held up had been let go, the portcullis fell with a great crash.\n\t\t\t\t\t Some of the Salapians attacked the deserters, who fresh from their march were carrying arms carelessly slung from their shoulders, as if among peaceable people; others from towers of the gate and from the walls frightened off the enemy with stones, poles and javelins.\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus Hannibal, having been ensnared by his own ruse, went away; and he set out to raise the siege of Locri, a city which Lucius Cincius was besieging with great violence by means of siege-works and with every sort of artillery brought from Sicily.\n\t\t\t\t\t For Mago, who no longer was confident that he would hold and defend the city, the first ray of hope came with the news of Marcellus' death.\n\t\t\t\t\t Then followed the news that Hannibal had sent the Numidian cavalry in advance and was himself following with the infantry column, making all possible speed.\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, as soon as Mago knew from signals given from watch-towers that the Numidians were approaching, he also suddenly opens a gate and sallies out confidently against the enemy. And at first it was a doubtful conflict, rather because his action had been unexpected than because he was a match in forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t Then when the Numidians came up, such terror was inspired among the Romans that they fled pell-mell to the sea and the ships, leaving siege-works and engines with which they were battering the walls.

If they had found him a criminal, why then, after unfortunately entrusting a former consulship, were they now entrusting a second to him?\n\t\t\t\t\t When he made use of these and similar arguments and complaints, the fathers would rebuke him, and by reminding him that Marcus Furius, on being recalled from exile, had restored his native city when driven from her place that, as in the case of parents, so the harshness of one's native city must be appeased by suffering and bearing it through\n\t\t\t\t\t the united efforts of them all, they elected Marcus Livius consul with Gaius Claudius."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "35"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.351"}, "note": [{"@type": "margin", "#text": "B.C. 208"}, "Cf. iv. 4; 1.8; XXVI. xxiii. 1."], "#text": "On the third day after that the election of praetors took place.

Delay in beginning the battle was due to Hasdrubal, in that, riding out in front of the standards with a few horsemen, he observed among the enemy old shields which he had not seen before and very lean horses; and he thought the numbers also larger than was usual.\n\t\t\t\t\t For, suspecting what had happened, he promptly sounded the recall and sent men to the river from which the Romans were drawing water, that some Romans might be captured there and scanned to see whether any chanced to be more sunburned, as though from a recent march.\n\t\t\t\t\t At the same time he ordered men to ride round the camps at a distance, and to notice whether the earthworks had been somewhere enlarged, and to mark whether the trumpet sounded once in the camp or twice.\n\t\t\t\t\t All this having been duly reported, the fact that the camps had not been enlarged deceived him. There were two of them, as there had been before the coming of the second consul, one that of Marcus Livius, the other that of Lucius Porcius. In neither case had anything been added to the fortifications to give ampler space for the tents.\n\t\t\t\t\t The one thing that impressed an experienced general and one accustomed to a Roman enemy was their report that the trumpet had sounded once in the praetor's camp, twice in the consul's. There surely were two consuls, he thought, and sadly concerned he was how the one had got away from Hannibal.\n\t\t\t\t\t Least of all could he suspect the fact-that Hannibal had been baffled and baulked to such an extent that he did not know where was the general, where was the army with which his camp was formerly in contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t Surely he had been deterred by no common disaster, and had not dared to pursue. Hasdrubal greatly feared that after all was lost he had himself come too late to assist, and that the Romans would have the same good fortune in Italy as in Spain.\n\t\t\t\t\t At times he believed his own letter had not reached Hannibal, and that the consul, upon intercepting it, had made haste, in order to overpower him. Troubled by these anxieties, he had the fires put out and orders given at the first watch that they should pack up their baggage in silence, and then he commanded the standards to advance.\n\t\t\t\t\t In the excitement and confusion of the night the guides were not closely watched, and one of them settled himself in a hiding-place he had previously determined upon, while the other swam across the river Metaurus, using a shallow place known to him. So the column, deserted by its guides, wandered at first about the country, and a considerable number, overcome by drowsiness and lack of sleep, threw themselves down anywhere and left few men with the standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasdrubal ordered the standard-bearers to move along the bank of the river, until daylight should disclose a road. And having made little progress, while describing blind circles along the bends and curves of the twisting stream he halted, intending to cross the river as soon as daylight should show a favourable crossing.\n\t\t\t\t\t But inasmuch as the farther he marched away from the sea the higher were the banks that confined the stream, and hence he could not find a ford, by wasting the day he gave the enemy time to overtake him."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "48"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3??"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}], "note": ["So Polybius XI. i. 5, who makes no mention of Porcius.", {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Hann."}, "#text": "10 in number and in the centre, Polybius  3; 15 according to Appian  52."}, "Polybius puts Hasdrubal in the centre, but makes him attack the Roman left wing;  3-5.", {"@type": "margin", "#text": "B.C. 207"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.401"}, "#text": "First Nero with all the cavalry arrived, then Porcius with the light-armed caught up with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t And while they made skirmishing attacks from every side and charged the weary column, and the Carthaginian, now abandoning a march which resembled a flight, was aiming to lay out a camp on the hill above the bank of the river, came Livius with\n\t\t\t\t\t all the infantry forces, not in marching order, but formed and armed to begin the battle at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t But after they had combined all their troops and the line had been drawn up, Claudius on the right wing, Livius on the left, prepared for battle, while the command of the centre was assigned to the praetor.\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasdrubal, on seeing that he must fight, ceased fortifying his camp and placed his elephants in the front line before the standards.
