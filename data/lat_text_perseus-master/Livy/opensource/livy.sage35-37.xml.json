If Hannibal should lose a fleet or an army, the loss would be the same as if they were lost by any other leader;\n\t\t\t\t\t if any success were attained, to Hannibal, not to Antiochus, would the credit accrue; but if in the whole war the fortune of conquering the Romans should be vouchsafed\n\t\t\t\t\t them, what hope was there that Hannibal would live under a king, subject to an individual, when he had practically failed to endure the rule of his own country?\n\t\t\t\t\t He had not conducted himself from youth up, cherishing in his hopes and thoughts the sovereignty of the world, in such a way that in his old age he would be ready, as it seemed, to suffer a master.

But if our embassy to him does not move him, let us at least, since we cannot unite him with ourselves, see to it that he does not make common cause with our foes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Your son Seleucus is at Lysimachia; if with that army which he has with him he shall begin to move through Thrace and devastate the adjacent portions of Macedonia, he will easily turn Philip from sending aid to the Romans to the more important task of defending his own possessions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t As to Philip you have my views; even from the first you have not been ignorant of my opinion as to the strategy of the war as a whole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t If I had been listened to then, the Romans would not now be hearing that Chalcis in Euboea was captured and a fort on the Euripus, but that Etruria and the coasts of Liguria and Cisalpine Gaul were aflame with war and this is what they dread beyond everything else that Hannibal is in Italy.

The gods were appeased now by the due performance of vows, now by the rites of atonement for the prodigies, and the consul departed to his province, ordering the proconsul Gnaeus Domitius to send his army back to Rome and leave the province; he himself led the legions into the country of the Boii."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "38"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "lex sacrata"}, "#text": "Violation of a  was punished by devotion of the offender to the gods of the lower world.

I should not venture to compare myself with anyone, either people or king, whom you hold in great honour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Masinissa was your enemy before he was your ally, nor was it while his kingdom was uninjured and he could bring his own troops to your help, but when he was an exile, banished, with all his resources gone, that he fled with one troop of cavalry to your camp;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t nevertheless, because he stood loyally and steadfastly with you in Africa against Syphax and the Carthaginians, you not only restored him to his paternal kingdom but, bestowing upon him the richest part of the realm of Syphax, you made him pre-eminent among the kings of Africa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Of what reward and honour, pray, are we then worthy in your sight, who have never been your enemies, always your allies?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t My father, myself, my brothers, not in Asia alone, but far from home, in the Peloponnesus, in Boeotia, in Aetolia, in the wars with Philip, with Antiochus, with the Aetolians, on land and sea, have borne arms in your cause. But someone may say,' What then do you ask?'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t As to that, conscript Fathers, (since I must in any case obey your wish that I should speak) if you expelled Antiochus beyond the heights of Taurus with the intention of yourselves holding those lands, there are no neighbours or settlers whom I prefer to you, nor do I expect that my kingdom will be safer or more enduring under any other circumstances;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t but if it is your purpose to retire and withdraw your armies from there, I should dare to say that no one of your allies is more worthy than I to hold what you have won in war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t But there will be protests because it is a fine thing to liberate enslaved cities. Such is my opinion, if they have committed no hostile acts against you; but if they were of Antiochus' party, how much more worthy of your wisdom and justice is it to have regard for well-deserving allies than for \n\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies?"}, "note": {"p": ["This speech is in essence the same as that in Polybius (XXII. ii. iv. incl.), but somewhat more effectively expressed.", {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "27??"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "28??"}], "#text": "The problems confronting Roman statesmanship now assume\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t more definite outline.
