They received a much less favourable audience from the council in the camp.\n\t\t\t\t\t So while some advised that the envoys be thrown into chains, others that they be driven headlong out of camp without an answer, the consul announced that he would make a reply a fortnight later. Meanwhile, to make it clear how much influence the Rhodian peace-makers had succeeded in exerting, he began to hold consultations as to the plan of campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t Some, especially the younger, wished to force a way through the bank of the Elpes and the fortifications;\n\t\t\t\t\t a solid formation, they said, attacking in single column would be irresistible to the Macedonians, who had the previous year been driven out of so many forts, rather higher and better fortified and held with strong garrisons.\n\t\t\t\t\t Others advised that Octavius with his fleet should make for Thessalonica and by ravaging the coastal area create a diversion of the king's forces, so that on the appearance of another attack in his rear the king would be pulled about to guard the inner part of his kingdom and be compelled to open a crossing somewhere over the Elpes. The consul himself regarded the riverbank as impregnable by nature and by fortification and, besides the fact that artillery had been placed everywhere, he had heard that the enemy employed missile weapons better and with more deadly aim.\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole thought of the Roman commander inclined in a different direction;\n\t\t\t\t\t and dismissing his council, he summoned the Perrhaebian merchants Coenus and Menophilus, men already known to him for loyalty and wisdom, and secretly inquired what the passes into Perrhaebia were like.\n\t\t\t\t\t When they said that the terrain was not difficult, but was blocked by the king's guard-forces, the consul conceived the hope that the guards could be dislodged if he attacked suddenly by night with a strong force and surprised them; for, he argued, javelins, arrows, and other missiles are useless in the dark when the target cannot be sighted at a distance;\n\t\t\t\t\t the sword is the weapon used at close quarters in a confused throng, and with that weapon the Roman soldier would win. Planning to use the abovementioned merchants as guides, the consul summoned the praetor Octavius, explained his plans, and ordered him to sail for Heracleum with the fleet and have ten days' cooked rations for a thousand men.\n\t\t\t\t\t For his own part, he sent Publius Scipio Nasica and his own son Quintus Fabius Maximus with five thousand picked\n\t\t\t\t\t men to Heracleum, in order to feign an embarkation for the purpose of the plan mentioned in the council, namely, of ravaging the coastal area of inner Macedonia. Scipio and Fabius were privately informed that food was ready for them at the fleet, so that they would not be\n\t\t\t\t\t delayed. Next, the guides were instructed to arrange the stages of the journey so that they could attack Pythos in the fourth watch of the third day. Next day at dawn the consul himself, in order to keep the king from investigating the other projects, joined battle with the enemy's outposts in the middle of the\n\t\t\t\t\t river-bed. The fight was conducted with light-armed troops on both sides. It was impossible to fight with heavier troops in so rough a stream-bed. The slope of either bank to the bottom was about three hundred paces; between the banks, a space of a little over a mile lay open where the torrent had hollowed it out in varying degrees from place to\n\t\t\t\t\t place. There the fight took place in sight of the watchers from the walls of both camps, the king on one side, the consul and his legions on the\n\t\t\t\t\t other. The king's light troops fought better at long range with missiles; at close quarters the Romans were steadier, and better protected by either the cavalry targe or the Ligurian rectangular\n\t\t\t\t\t shield. About noon the consul ordered the recall to be sounded for his\n\t\t\t\t\t men. So that day the fight was broken off with no small losses to both sides. At sunrise the next day an even sharper fight took place, since their spirits had been roused by the\n\t\t\t\t\t combat. But the Romans received a great many wounds not only from those with whom the fight had been joined, but much more from the large numbers posted on the towers with all sorts of missile weapons and stones. As they came nearer to the enemy's bank, the shots from the engines reached even the rear ranks. After far more severe losses that day, the consul recalled his men somewhat\n\t\t\t\t\t later. On the third day, he desisted from battle and went down to the lower side of the camp as if he were going to attempt the crossing through the spur of the fortifications which ran down to the\n\t\t\t\t\t sea.

C.I.L. 5, i, 3233 (Verona): IUN(oni) LUN(ae)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tREG(inae) SACR.-a dedication of a freedman, of\n\t\t\t\t\t\timperial date). Intercalations were accordingly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tomitted till  (cf. Macrobius I. 14, ), but the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnovelty of adding ten days to the standard year\n\t\t\t\t\t\twas also omitted after its first occurrence. We must\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassume that a cycle-end fell within the period of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfourteen years, so that one intercalation would\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnormally have been omitted, leaving six which were\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdropped because of the new arrangement. Six\n\t\t\t\t\t\tintercalations = 135 days, less ten extra days in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t = 125 days lost from account. In \n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe consul Acilius Glabrio sponsored a law which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgave the pontiffs a free hand to regulate intercalation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(Macrobius I. 13. 21), probably to secure the gradual\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcorrection of the error. The intercalation of the year\n\t\t\t\t\t\t169 may well have been an extraordinary one, as\n\t\t\t\t\t\twell as that of  (XLV. xliv. 3), thus arousing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe special interest reflected by Livy's mention of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthese events, for he does not mention all the intercalations which must have occurred.
