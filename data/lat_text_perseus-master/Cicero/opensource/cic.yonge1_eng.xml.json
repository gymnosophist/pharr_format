And yet it\n            would not seem so disastrous for us that these things should exist in the highest degree\n            in the other party, if they existed also to a moderate extent in us; but the fact is,\n            that I, who have neither sufficient experience nor much ability, am brought into\n            comparison with a most eloquent advocate; and that Publius Quinctius, who has but small\n            influence, no riches, and few friends, is contending with a most influential adversary.\n               And, moreover, we have this additional disadvantage,\n            that Marcus Junius, who has several times pleaded this cause before you, O Aquillius, a\n            man practised in the conduct of other causes also, and much and frequently concerned in\n            this particular one, is at this moment absent, being engaged on his new commission;\n               and so they have had recourse to me, who, even if I had all other\n            requisite qualifications in ever so high a degree, have certainly scarcely had time\n            enough to be able to understand so important a business, having so many points of\n            dispute involved in it so that also, which has been\n            used to be an assistance to me in other causes, is wanting to me in this one; for in\n            proportion to my want of ability, have I endeavoured to make amends for that want by\n            industry, and unless time and space be given to one, it cannot be seen how great his\n            industry is. But the greater our disadvantages, O Caius Aquillius, are, with so much the\n            more favourable a disposition ought you, and those who are your colleagues in this\n            trial, to listen to our words, that the truth, though weakened by many disadvantages,\n            may be at last reestablished by the equity of such men as you.

What then? In the first place, the magnitude of the danger\n            causes a man the greatest fear, because he is staking all his fortunes on one trial; and\n            while he is thinking of this, the recollection of your power does not occur to his mind\n            less frequently than that of your justice; because all men whose lives are in another's\n            hand more frequently think of what he, in whose power and under whose dominion they are,\n            can do, than of what he ought to do,\n            Secondly, Publius Quinctius has for his adversary, in name indeed, Sextus Naevius, but\n            in reality, the most eloquent, the most gallant, the most accomplished men of our state,\n            who are defending Sextus Naevius with one common zeal, and with all their power: if,\n            indeed, defending means so to comply with the desire of another, that he may the more\n            easily be able to overwhelm whomsoever he chooses by an unjust trial;  for what, O Caius Aquillius, can be mentioned or spoken of more\n            unjust or more unworthy than this, that I who am defending the liberties,  the fame, and fortunes of another\n            should be compelled to open the cause, especially when Quintus Hortensius, who in this\n            trial fills the part of the accuser, is to speak against me; a man to whom nature has\n            given the greatest possible fluency and energy in speaking? Matters are so managed, that\n            I, who ought rather to ward off the darts of our adversary and to heal the wounds he has\n            inflicted, am compelled to do so now, even when the adversary has cast no dart; and that\n            that time is given to them to attack us when the power of avoiding their attacks is to\n            be taken from us; and if in any particular they should (as they are well prepared to do)\n            cast any false accusation like a poisoned arrow at us, there will be no opportunity for\n            applying a remedy.  That has happened through the\n            injustice and wrong-doing of the praetor; first, because, contrary to universal custom,\n            he has chosen that the trial as to honour or infamy  should take place before the one\n            concerning the fact; secondly, because he has so arranged this very trial, that the\n            defendant is compelled to plead his cause before he has heard a word of the accuser's;\n            and this has been done because of the influence and power of those men who indulge the\n            violence and covetousness of Sextus Naevius as eagerly as if their own property or\n            honour were at stake, and who make experiment of their influence in such matters as\n            this, in which the more weight they have through their virtue and nobility, the less\n            they ought to make a parade of what influence they have.  Since Publius Quinctius, involved in and overwhelmed by such numerous\n            and great difficulties, has taken refuge, O Caius Aquillius, in your good faith, in your\n            truth, in your compassion; when, up to this time , owing to the might of his\n            adversaries, no equal law could be found for him, no equal liberty of pleading, no just\n            magistrate, when, through the greatest injustice, everything was unfavourable and\n            hostile to him; he now prays and entreats you, O Caius Aquillius, and all of you who are\n            present as assessors, to allow justice, which has been tossed about and agitated by many\n            injuries, at length to find rest and a firm footing in this place."}, {"note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "praeco"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "praecones"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "decuriones"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "municipia"}], "#text": "The office of  was so little reputable that before Cicero's death a law was\n              passed to prevent all persons who had been  from\n              becoming  in the .

Caius Quinctius was the brother of this\n            Publius Quinctius; in other respects a sufficiently prudent and attentive head of a\n            family, but in one matter a little less wise, inasmuch as he formed a partnership with\n            Sextus Naevius, a respectable man, but one who had not been brought up so as to be\n            acquainted with the rights of partnership, or with the duties of a head of an\n            established family. \n            Not that he was wanting in abilities; for Sextus Naevius as a buffoon was never\n            considered without wit, nor as a crier was he reckoned unmannerly. What followed? As\n            nature had given him nothing better than a voice, and his father had left him nothing\n            besides his freedom, he made gain of his voice, and used his freedom for the object of\n            being loquacious with impunity.  So there was no\n            reason in the world for your taking him as a partner, except that he might learn with\n            your money what a harvest money can produce. Nevertheless, induced by acquaintance and\n            intimacy with the man, Quinctius, as I have said, entered into a partnership with him as\n            to those articles which were procured in .\n            He had considerable property in cattle, and a well-cultivated and productive farm.\n            Naevius is carried off from the halls of Licinius,  and from the gang of criers, into\n               and across the ; there is a great change in his situation,  none in his disposition; for he who from his boyhood had been\n            proposing to himself gain without any outlay, as soon as he spent anything himself and\n            brought it to the common stock, could not be content with a moderate profit.  Nor is it any wonder if he, who had his voice for sale,\n            thought that those things which he had acquired by his voice would be a great profit to\n            him; so that without much moderation, he carried off whatever he could from the common\n            stock to his private house for himself. And in this he was as industrious as if all who\n            behaved in a partnership with exact good faith, were usually condemned in a trial before\n            an arbitrator.  But concerning\n            these matters I do not consider it necessary to say what Publius Quinctius wishes me to\n            mention; although the cause calls for it: yet as it only calls for it, and does not\n            absolutely require it,  I will pass it over."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}, {"@key": "tgn,7008368", "#text": "Narbonne"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "15", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "16", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "17", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "5", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "18", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "ad Castoris"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "a quaestoribus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "rat"}], "quote": {"@lang": "la", "l": ["rat multus in arca", "Fiscus et ad vigilem ponendi Castora nummi."]}, "bibl": {"@n": "Juv. 14.260", "#text": "Juv. xiv. 260."}, "#text": "Some have wished to alter  here to ; but the temple of Castor was a place where much\n              money was kept:\n               and the precincts were\n              accordingly much frequented by men skillful in computing accounts, and the exchange of\n              money."}, "#text": "When this partnership had now subsisted many years, and when Naevius had often been\n            suspected by Quinctius, and was not able conveniently to give an account of the\n            transactions which he had carried on according to his caprice, and not on any system,\n            Quinctius dies in , when Naevius was there\n            too, and dies suddenly. By his will he left this Publius Quinctius his heir, in order\n            that, as great grief would come to him by his death, great honour should also accrue to\n            him.  When he was dead, Publius Quinctius soon after\n            goes into . There he lives on terms of\n            intimacy with that fellow Naevius. There they are together nearly a year, during which\n            they had many communications with one another about their partnership, and about the\n            whole of their accounts and their estate in ; nor during that time did Naevius utter one single word about either\n            the partnership owing him anything, or about Quinctius having owed him anything on his\n            private account.

On this, this\n            excellent man, Sextus Naevius, dissuades the man by many speeches from putting the\n            things up to auction, saying that he would not be able at that time to sell so\n            conveniently what he had advertised. That he had a sum of money at , which if Quinctius were wise he would consider\n            their common property, from their brotherly intimacy, and also from his relationship\n            with himself; for Naevius has married the cousin of Publius Quinctius, and has children\n            by her. Because Naevius was saying just what a good man ought, Quinctius believed that\n            he who imitated the language of good men, would imitate also their actions.

He preferred submitting to your decision in this matter, because, on account\n            of the difference in the exchange, it was not sufficient to look in his books and see\n            how much was owed, unless he had inquired at the temple of Castor  how much was to be paid in Roman money.

He\n            arranged, therefore, that he would pay the Scapulae as if he had the money at home.

Lucius Albius the son of Sextus of the Quirine tribe, a good\n            man and of the highest reputation for honour, set out with him. When they had come to\n            the place called the fords of Volaterra, they see a great friend of Naevius, who was\n            bringing him some slaves from  to be sold,\n            Lucius Publicius by name, who when he arrived in  told Naevius in what place he had seen Quinctius; and unless this\n            had been told Naevius by Publicius, the matter would not so soon have come to trial.\n               Then Naevius sends his slaves round to his friends;\n            he summons himself all his associates from the halls of Licinius and from the jaws of\n            the shambles, and entreats them to come to the booth of Sextus by the second hour of the\n            next day. They come in crowds; he makes oath that Publius Quinctius has not appeared to\n            his bail, and that he has appeared to his. A long protest to this effect is sealed with\n            the seals of noble men. They depart: Naevius demands of Burrienus the praetor, that by\n            his edict he may take possession of Quinctius's goods.  He urged the confiscation of the property of that man with\n            whom he had had intimacy, with whom he actually was in partnership, between whom and\n            himself there was a relationship, which while his children lived could not possibly be\n            annulled.  From which act it could easily be perceived\n            that there is no bond so holy and solemn, that avarice is not in the habit of weakening\n            and violating it. In truth, if friendship is kept up by truth, society by good faith,\n            relationship by affection, it is inevitable that he who has endeavoured to despoil his\n            friend, his partner, and his relation of fame and fortune, should confess himself\n            worthless and perfidious and impious.  Sextus\n            Alphenus, the agent of Publius Quinctius, the intimate friend and relation of Sextus\n            Naevius, tears down the bills; carries off one little slave whom Naevius had laid hold\n            of; gives notice that he is the agent, and that it is only fair that that fellow should\n            consult the fame and fortunes of Publius Quinctius, and await his arrival. But if he\n            would not do so, and believed that by such methods he could bring him into the\n            conditions which he proposed, then he asked nothing as a favour, and if Naevius chose to\n            go to law, he would defend him at the trial.  While\n            this is being done at , meantime\n            Quinctius, contrary to law and to custom, and to the edicts of the praetors, is driven\n            by force by the slaves which belonged to both him and Naevius, as partners, from their\n            common lands and estates."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "29", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "8", "@unit": "chapter"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "caput"}, "#text": "There is an allusion here to the fights of gladiators, in which the\n              people disapproved of that gladiator who aimed too constantly at the vital parts of\n              his adversary, so as to make the combat short.

If fortune deprived any one of money, or if the injustice of another took\n            it from him, still while his reputation is unimpeached, honour easily makes amends for\n            poverty. And some men, though stained with ignominy, or convicted in discreditable\n            trials, still enjoy their wealth; are not forced to dance attendance (which is the most\n            wretched of all states) on the power of another; and in their distresses they are\n            relieved by this support and comfort; but he whose goods have been sold, who has seen\n            not merely his ample estates, but even his necessary food and clothing put up under the\n            hammer, with great disgrace to himself; he is not only erased from the list of men, but\n            he is removed out of sight, if possible, even beneath the dead. An honourable  death forsooth often sets off even a base\n            life, but a dishonoured life leaves no room to hope for even an honourable death.\n               Therefore, in truth, when a man's goods are taken\n            possession of according to the praetor's edict, all his fame and reputation is seized at\n            the same time with his goods. A man about whom placards are posted in the most\n            frequented places, is not allowed even to perish in silence and obscurity; a man who has\n            assignees and trustees appointed to pronounce to him on what terms and conditions he is\n            to be ruined; a man about whom the voice of the crier makes proclamation and proclaims\n            his price,he has a most bitter funeral procession while he is alive, if that\n            may be considered a funeral in which men meet not as friends to do honour to his\n            obsequies, but purchasers of his goods as executioners, to tear to pieces and divide the\n            relics of his existence."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "52", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "53", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "17", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "54", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Therefore our ancestors determined that such a thing should seldom happen; the praetors\n            have taken care that it should only happen after deliberation; good men, even when fraud\n            is openly committed, when there is no opportunity of trying the case at law, still have\n            recourse to this measure timidly and hesitatingly; not till they are compelled by force\n            and necessity, unwillingly, when the recognizances have often been forfeited, when they\n            have been often deceived and outwitted.

But if, in a cause where the merits were\n            equal, he seemed to come off the worse, that would be in no small degree to be\n            complained of; but now, when he is in the right, he does not even demand to come off\n            best; he submits to be worsted, only with these limitations, that he is not to be given\n            up with his goods, his character, and all his fortunes, to the covetousness and cruelty\n            of Sextus Naevius."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "61", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "62", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "20", "@unit": "chapter"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "#text": "I have proved what I first promised to prove, O Caius Aquillius, that there was\n            absolutely no cause why he should make this demand; that neither was any money owed, and\n            that if it were owed ever so much, nothing had been done to excuse recourse being had to\n            such measures as these. Remark now, that the goods of Publius Quinctius could not\n            possibly have been taken possession of in accordance with the praetor's edict. Recite\n            the edict. He who for the sake of fraud has lain hid. That is not\n            Quinctius, unless they be hid who depart on their own business, leaving an agent behind\n            them. The man who has no heir. Even that is not he. The\n            man who leaves the country in exile. At what time, O Naevius, do you think\n            Quinctius ought to have been defended in his absence, or how? Then, when you were\n            demanding leave to take possession of his goods? No one was present, for no one could\n            guess that you were going to make such a demand; nor did it concern any one to object to\n            that which the praetor ordered not to be done absolutely, but to be done according to\n            his edict.  What was the first opportunity, then,\n            which was given to the agent of defending this absent man? When you were putting up the\n            placards. Then Sextus Alphenus was present: he did not permit it; he tore down the\n            notices. That which was the first step of duty was observed by the agent with the\n            greatest diligence. Let us see what followed on this. You arrest the servant of Publius\n            Quinctius in public: you attempt to take him away. Alphenus does not permit it; he takes\n            him from you by force; he takes care that he is led home to Quinctius. Here too is seen\n            in a high degree the attention of an illustrious agent. You say that Quinctius is in\n            your debt; his agent denies it. You wish security to he given; he promises it. You call\n            him into court; he follows you. You demand a trial; he does not object. What other could\n            be the conduct of one defending a man in his absence I do not understand.  But who was the agent? I suppose it was some insignificant\n            man, poor, litigious, worthless, who might be able to endure the daily abuse of a\n            wealthy buffoon. Nothing of the sort: he was a wealthy Roman knight; a man managing his\n            own affairs well: he was, in short, the man whom Naevius himself as often as he went\n            into , left as his agent at ."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "63", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "64", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "65", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "21", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "66", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Intercedo"}, "#text": "was the technical word for the\n              interposition of the tribunes."}, "#text": "And do you dare, O Sextus Naevius, to deny that Quinctius was defended in his absence,\n            when the same man defended him who used to defend you? and when he accepted the trial on\n            behalf of Quinctius, to whom when departing you used to recommend and entrust your own\n            property and character? Do you attempt to say that there was no one who defended\n            Quinctius at the trial?  I\n            demanded, says he, that security should be given. You\n            demanded it unjustly. The order was made. Alphenus objected.\n            He did, but the praetor made the decree. Therefore the tribunes\n            were appealed to. Here, said he, I have you: that is\n            not allowing a trial, nor defending a man at a trial, when you ask assistance from the\n            tribunes. When I consider how prudent Hortensius is, I do not think that he\n            will say this; but when I hear that he has said so before, and when I consider the cause\n            itself I do not see what else he can say; for he admits that Alphenus tore down the\n            bills, undertook to give security, did not object to go to trial in the very terms which\n            Naevius proposed; but on this condition, that according to custom and prescription, it\n            should be before that magistrate who was appointed in order to give assistance.\n               You must either say that these things are not so;\n            or that Caius Aquillius, being such a man as he is, on his oath, is to establish this\n            law in the state: that he whose agent does not object to every trial which any one\n            demands against him, whose agent dares to appeal from the praetor to the tribunes, is\n            not defended at all, and may rightly have his goods taken possession of; may properly,\n            while miserable, absent, and ignorant of it, have all the embellishments of his\n            fortunes, all the ornaments of his life, taken from him with the greatest disgrace and\n            ignominy. And this seems reasonable to no one.  This\n            certainly must be proved to the satisfaction of every one, that Quinctius while absent\n            was defended at the trial. And as that is the ease, his goods were not taken possession\n            of in accordance with the edict. But then, the tribunes of the people did not even hear\n            his cause. I admit, if that be the case, that the agent ought to have obeyed the decree\n            of the praetor. What; if Marcus Brutus openly said that he would intercede  unless some agreement was come to between\n            Alphenus himself and Naevius; does not the appeal to the tribunes seem to have been\n            interposed not for the sake of delay but of assistance?"}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "67", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "68", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "69", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "70", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "22", "@unit": "chapter"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "haereret"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "cederet"}], "#text": "The text is undoubtedly corrupt\n              here.

Quinctius does appear to his recognizances. The matter lies in dispute\n            while that fellow is spreading his calumnies for two years, until he could find out by\n            what means the affair might be diverted out of the common course of proceeding, and the\n            whole cause he confined to this single point to which it is now limited. What duty of an agent can possibly be mentioned, O Caius\n            Aquillius, which seems to have been overlooked by Alphenus? What reason is alleged why\n            it should be denied that Publius Quinctius was defended in his absence? Is it that which\n            I suppose Hortensius will allege, because he has lately mentioned it, and because\n            Naevius is always harping on it, that Naevius was not contending on equal terms with\n            Alphenus, at such a time, and with such magistrates? And if I were willing to admit\n            that, they will, I suppose, grant this, that it is not the case that no one was the\n            agent of Publius Quinctius, but that he had one who was popular. But it is quite\n            sufficient for me to prove that there was an agent, with whom he could have tried the\n            matter. What sort of man he was, as long as he defended the man in his absence,\n            according to law and before the proper magistrate, I think has nothing to do with the\n            matter.  For he was, says he,\n            a man of the opposite party. No doubt; a man who had been brought\n            up in your house, whom you from a youth had so trained up as not to favour any one of\n            eminence, not even a gladiator.  If Alphenus had the same wish as you always especially entertained, was\n            not the contest between you on equal terms in that matter? Oh,\n            says he, he was an intimate friend of Brutus, and therefore he\n            interposed. You on the other hand were an intimate friend of Burrienus, who\n            gave an unjust decision; and, in short, of all those men who at that time were both very\n            powerful with violence and wickedness, and who dared do all that they could. Did you\n            wish to overcome those men, who now are labouring with such zeal that you may be\n            victorious? Dare to say that, not openly, but to these very men whom you have brought\n            with you.  Although I am unwilling to bring that\n            matter up again by mentioning it, every recollection of which I think ought to be\n            entirely effaced and destroyed."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "71", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "72", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "73", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "23", "@unit": "chapter"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "de\n              probro"}, "#text": "Because the matter in dispute was really a money matter, but the praetor\n              ordered the trial to proceed .Hottoman."}, "#text": "This one thing I say, if Alphenus was an influential man because of his party zeal,\n            Naevius was most influential; if Alphenus, relying on his personal interest, made any\n            rather unjust demand; Naevius demanded, and obtained too, things much more unjust. Nor\n            was there, as I think, any difference between your zeal. In ability, in experience, in\n            cunning, you easily surpassed him. To say nothing of other things, this is sufficient:\n            Alphenus was ruined with those men, and for the sake of those men to whom he was\n            attached; you, after those men who were your friends could not get the better, took care\n            that those who did get the better should be your friends.

This really is what an unequal contest is; not that one in which you\n            were skirmishing against Alphenus. You did not leave him any place where he could make a\n            stand against you. You must therefore either prove that Alphenus denied he was his\n            agent, did not tear down the bills, and refused to go to trial; or, if all this was\n            done, you must admit that you did not take possession of the goods of Publius Quinctius\n            in accordance with the edict."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "74", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "75", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "24", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "76", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "If, indeed, you did take possession of the things according to the edict, I ask you why\n            they were not soldwhy the others who were his securities and creditors did\n            not meet together?

I said to Quintus Roscius\n            here, whose sister is the wife of Publius Quinctius, when he asked of me, and, with the\n            greatest earnestness, entreated me to defend his relation, that it was very difficult\n            for me, not only to sum up a cause against such orators, but even to attempt to speak at\n            all. When he pressed it more eagerly, I said to the man very familiarly, as our\n            friendship justified, that a man appeared to me to have a very brazen face, who, while\n            he was present, could attempt to use action in speaking, but those who contended with\n            him himself, even though before that they seemed to have any skill or elegance, lost it,\n            and that I was afraid lest something of the same sort would happen to me when I was\n            going to speak against so great an artist."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "79", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "80", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "26", "@unit": "chapter"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,2066659", "#text": "Alps"}], "#text": "Then Roscius said many other things with a view to encourage me, and in truth, if he\n            were to say nothing he would still move any one by the very silent affection and zeal\n            which he felt for his relation.

None, I\n            imagine. Let us refer to the edict.They who in accordance with my\n            edict have come into possession. He is speaking of you, Naevius, as you\n            think; for you say that you came into possession according to the edict.

And that even if he did appeal to the\n            tribunes, he was not on that account the less prepared to submit to a trial; and that\n            Naevius had not had his rights wrested from him by the powerful interest of the agent;\n            that on the other hand he was so much superior to us in interest that he now scarcely\n            gives us the liberty of breathing."}, {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Intentio"}, "#text": "was the technical legal term for the claim made by the\n              plaintiff."}, "milestone": [{"@n": "89", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "90", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "30", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "91", "@unit": "section"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000070", "#text": "Gaul"}], "#text": "I asked what the reason was why the goods had not been sold, since they had been taken\n            possession of according to the edict.

Especially when in such a\n            trial the testimonies of creditors are thought exceedingly material. After that, I\n            employed the testimony of the adversary, who lately entered as his partner the man who,\n            according to the language of his present claim,  he demonstrates was at that time not even in the number of living\n            men. Then I mentioned that incredible rapidity, or rather audacity of his. I showed that\n            it was inevitable, either that seven hundred miles had been run over in two days, or\n            that Sextus Naevius had sent men to take possession many days before he demanded leave\n            so to seize his goods.  After that I recited the\n            edict, which expressly forbade the owner to be driven off his by which it was plain that\n            Naevius had not taken possession according to the edict, as he confessed that Quinctius\n            had been driven off his farm by force. But I thoroughly proved that the goods had\n            actually not been taken possession of, because such a seizure of goods is looked at not\n            as to part but with respect to everything which can be seized or taken possession of.

What then shall be done?  They have not so much more influence, that those who, having\n            abandoned the strict discipline of virtuous men, have chosen rather to follow the gains\n            and extravagance of Gallonius, and\n            have even spent their liven in audacity and perfidy which were no part of his character,\n            should have absolute dominion over the lives and fortunes of honourable men.

Doubt now, O judges, if you can, by whom Sextus Roscius was\n            murdered; whether by him, who, on account of his death, is exposed to poverty and\n            treachery, who has not even opportunity allowed him of making inquiry into his father's\n            death; or by those who shun investigation, who are in possession of his property, who\n            live amid murder, and by murder. Everything in this cause, O judges, is lamentable and\n            scandalous; but there is nothing which can be mentioned more bitter or more iniquitous\n            than this. The son is not allowed to put his father's slaves to the question concerning\n            his father's death. He is not to be master of his own slaves so long as to put them to\n            the question concerning his father's death. I will come again, and that speedily, to\n            this topic.

You must inevitably agree with me, if he is really\n            implicated in this crime, that he either committed it with his own hand, which you deny,\n            or by means of some other men, either freemen or slaves. Were they freemen? You can\n            neither show that he had any opportunity of meeting them, nor by what means he could\n            persuade them, nor where he saw them, nor by what agency he trafficked with them, nor by\n            what hope, or what bribe he persuaded them. I show, on the other hand, not only that\n            Sextus Roscius did nothing of all this, but that he was not even able to do anything,\n            because he had neither been at  for many\n            years, nor did he ever leave his farm without some object.

What is it, then? Whither has the accuser betaken himself in\n            his dearth of arguments?

What do you say? Men were constantly being\n            killed? By whose agency? and by whom? Do you not perceive that you have been brought\n            here by brokers? What next? Are we ignorant that in these times the same men were\n            brokers of men's lives as well as of their possessions?  Shall those men then, who at that time used to run about armed night and day, who\n            spent all their time in rapine and murder, object to Sextus Roscius the bitterness and\n            iniquity of that time? and will they think that troops of assassins, among whom they\n            themselves were leaders and chiefs, can be made a ground of accusation against him? who\n            not only was not at , but who was utterly\n            ignorant of everything that was being done at , because he was continually in the country, as you yourself admit.\n               I fear that I may be wearisome to you, O judges, or\n            that I may seem to distrust your capacity, if I dwell longer on matters which are so\n            evident. The whole accusation of Erucius, as I think, is at an end; unless perhaps you\n            expect me to refute the charges which he has brought against us of peculation and of\n            other imaginary crimes of that sort; charges unheard of by us before this time, and\n            quite novel; which he appeared to me to be spouting out of some other speech which he\n            was composing against some other criminal; so wholly were they unconnected with either\n            the crime of parricide, or the man who is now on his trial. But as he accuses us of\n            these things with his bare word, it is sufficient to deny them with our bare word.

We have seen many men slain, not at Thrasymenus, but at Servilius.\n              \n             I need not enumerate all,the Curtii, the Marii, the Mamerci, whom\n            age now exempted from battles; and, lastly, the aged Priam himself, Antistius,  whom not only his age, but even the laws excused from\n            going to battle.

But, as is\n            often the case, the violence and tumultuous nature of war brings many things to pass\n            without the knowledge of the generals. While he who was administering the main\n            government was occupied in other matters, there were men who in the meantime were curing\n            their own wounds; who rushed about in the darkness and threw everything into confusion\n            as if eternal night had enveloped the whole Republic. And by such men as these I wonder\n            that the courts of justice were not burnt, that there might be no trace left of any\n            judicial proceedings; for they did destroy both judges and accusers. There is this\n            advantage, that they lived in such a manner that even if they wished it, they could not\n            put to death all the witnesses; for as long as the race of men exists, there will not be\n            wanting men to accuse them: as long as the state lasts, trials will take place. But as I\n            began to say, both Erucius, if he had these arguments to use which I have mentioned, in\n            any cause Of his, would be able to speak on them as long as he pleased, and I can do the\n            same.

Therefore it was established\n            by the custom of our ancestors, that even in the most insignificant matters, the most\n            honourable men should not be allowed to give evidence in their own cause.  Africanus, who declares by his surname that he subdued a\n            third part of the whole world, still, if a case of his own were being tried, would not\n            give evidence.

Is it not evident that it was the same man who sent the news to Ameria?\n            Chrysogonus takes care that his goods shall be immediately sold; he who had neither his\n            own the man nor his estate. But how did it occur to him to wish for the farms of a man\n            who was unknown to him, whom he had never seen in his life? You are accustomed, O\n            judges, when you hear anything of this sort to say at once, some fellow-citizen or\n            neighbour must have told him; they generally tell these things; most men are betrayed by\n            such. Here there is no ground for your entertaining this suspicion.  I will not argue thus. It is probable that the Roscii gave\n            information of that matter to Chrysogonus, for there was of old, friendship between them\n            and Chrysogonus; for though the Roscii had many ancient patrons and friends hereditarily\n            connected with them, they ceased to pay any attention and respect to them, and betook\n            themselves to the protection and support of Chrysogonus.  I can say all this with truth; for in this case I have no need to\n            rely on conjecture. I know to a certainty that they themselves do not deny that\n            Chrysogonus made the attack on this property at their instigation. If you see with your\n            own eyes who has received a part of the reward for the information, can you possibly\n            doubt, O judges, who gave the information?

Is there then any doubt that they put this plunder in\n            Chrysogonus's way, who have received from him a share of the plunder?  Come now let us consider the action of the Roscii by the judgment of\n            Chrysogonus himself. If in that contest the Roscii had done nothing which was worth\n            speaking of, on what account were they presented with such rewards by Chrysogonus? If\n            they did nothing more than inform him of the fact, was it not enough for him to thank\n            them? Why are these farms of such value immediately given to ? Why does that fellow Roscius possess all the\n            rest in common property with Chrysogonus?

He is the hindrance to Sulla's being informed of this affair; he\n            betrays the plans and intentions of the other deputies to Chrysogonus; he gives him\n            warning to take care that the affair be not conducted openly; he points out to him, that\n            if the sale of the property be prevented, he will lose a large sum of money, and that he\n            himself will be in danger of his life. He proceeds to spur him on, to deceive those who\n            were joined in the commission with him; to warn him continually to take care; to hold\n            out treacherously false hopes to the others; in concert with him to devise plans against\n            them, to betray their counsels to him; with him to bargain for his share in the plunder,\n            and, relying constantly on some delay or other, to cut off from his colleagues all\n            access to Sulla. Lastly, owing to his being the prompter, the adviser, the go-between,\n            the deputies did not see Sulla; deceived by his faith, or rather by his perfidy, as you\n            may know from themselves, if the accuser is willing to produce them  as witnesses, they brought back home with a false\n            hope instead of a reality.  In private affairs if any\n            one had managed a business entrusted to him, I will not say maliciously for the sake of\n            his own gain and advantage, but even carelessly, our ancestors thought that he had\n            incurred the greatest disgrace.

And rightly; because he who has communicated an affair to another\n            thinks that he has procured assistance for himself. To whose good faith, then, shall a\n            man have recourse who is injured by the want of faith in the man whom he has trusted?\n            But these offences are to be punished with the greatest severity which are guarded\n            against with the greatest difficulty. We can be reserved towards strangers; intimate\n            friends must see many things more openly; but how can we guard against a companion? for\n            even to be afraid of him is to do violence to the rights of duty. Our ancestors\n            therefore rightly thought that he who had deceived his companion ought not to be\n            considered in the number of good men.  But Titus\n            Roscius did not deceive one friend alone in a money matter, (which, although it be a\n            grave offence, still appears possible in some degree to be borne) but he led on,\n            cajoled, and deserted nine most honourable men, betrayed them to their adversaries, and\n            deceived them with every circumstance of fraud and perfidy. They who could suspect\n            nothing of his wickedness, ought not to have been afraid of the partner of their duties;\n            they did not see his malice, they trusted his false speech. Therefore these most\n            honourable men are now, on account of his treachery, thought to have been incautious and\n            improvident He who was at the beginning a traitor, then a deserterwho at\n            first reported the counsels of his companions to their adversaries, and then entered\n            into a confederacy with the adversaries themselves, even now terrifies us, and threatens\n            us, adorned with his three farms, that is, with the prizes of his wickedness.

What\n            then, I ask, shall we say, O judges?

The most\n            noble and respectable men of our state, whom I have named before, made the request, who\n            have lived in such a manner, and are so esteemed by the Roman people, that there is no\n            one who would not think whatever they said reasonable.

When Sextus Roscius was\n            murdered they were there. The slaves themselves, as far as I am concerned, I neither\n            accuse nor acquit; but the point which I see you contending for, namely, that they be\n            not submitted to the question, is full of suspicion. But the reason of their being held\n            in such horror by you, must be that they know something, which, if they were to tell,\n            will be pernicious to you. Oh, say you, it is unjust to put questions to slaves against\n            their masters. Is any such question meant to be put? For Sextus Roscius is the\n            defendant, and when inquiry is being made into his conduct, you do not say that you are\n            their masters. Oh, they are with Chrysogonus. I suppose so; Chrysogonus is so taken with\n            their learning and accomplishments, that be wishes these menmen little better\n            than labourers from the training of a rustic master of a family at Ameria, to mingle\n            with his elegant youths, masters of every art and every refinementyouths\n            picked out of many of the politest households.  That\n            cannot be the truth, O judges; it is not probable that Chrysogonus has taken a fancy to\n            their learning or their politeness, or that he should be acquainted with their industry\n            and fidelity in the business of a household.

As far as I am concerned, I have no\n            suspicion of the sort respecting Chrysogonus, and this is not the first time that it has\n            occurred to me to say so. You recollect that I so divided the cause at the beginning;\n            into the accusation, the whole arguing of which was entrusted to Erucius; and into\n            audacity, the business of which was assigned to the Roscii;whatever crime,\n            whatever wickedness, whatever bloodshed there is, all that is the business of the\n            Roscii.

For\n            this cause is, in truth, a novel and an extraordinary cause. Chrysogonus is the\n            purchaser of the property of Sextus Roscius.  Let us\n            see this first, on what pretence the property of that man was sold, or how they could be\n            sold. And I will not put this question, O judges, so as to imply that it is a scandalous\n            thing for the property of an innocent man to be sold at all.

While there, were any garrisons, he was in the garrisons of\n            Sulla; after they laid down their arms, returning from supper, he was slain at\n               in a time of perfect peace. If he was\n            slain by law, I admit that his property was sold by law too; but if it is evident that\n            he was slain contrary to all laws, not merely to old laws, but to the new ones also,\n            then I ask by what right, or in what manner, or by what law they were sold?"}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "128", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "129", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "45", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "130", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "You ask, against whom do I say this, O Erucius.

I say that Chrysogonus did all this in order\n            to tell lies; in order to make out Roscius to have been a bad citizen; in order to\n            represent him as slain among the opposite party; in order to prevent Lucius Sulla from\n            being rightly informed of these matters by the deputies from Ameria.

For I think it\n            is set down in the law on what day these proscriptions and sales shall take place,\n            forsooth on the first of January.

I am aware, O judges, that I am investigating this point prematurely, and that I am\n            erring as greatly as if, while I ought to be curing a mortal sickness of Sextus Roscius,\n            I were mending a whitlow; for he is not anxious about his money; he has no regard to any\n            pecuniary advantage; he thinks he can easily endure his poverty, if he is released from\n            this unworthy suspicion, from this false accusation. \n            But I entreat you, O judges, to listen to the few things I have still to say, under the\n            idea that I am speaking partly for myself, and party for Sextus Roscius.

One demand is important and odious, the other is more trifling and easy to\n            be got rid of. Is it a sum which is owing from the partnership? What are you saying?\n            This is neither to be borne lightly nor to be defended carelessly. For if there are any\n            private actions of the greatest, I may almost say, of capital importance, they are these\n            threethe actions about trust, about guardianship, and about partnership.

And as\n            this is the case, let us consider who. it is who in this instance has deceived and\n            cheated his partner. For his past life shall silently give us a trustworthy and\n            important testimony one way or other. Is it Quintus Roscius? What do you say? Does not,\n            as fire dropped upon water is immediately extinguished and cooled, so, does not, I say,\n            a false accusation, when brought in contact with a most pure and holy life, instantly\n            fall and become extinguished? Has Roscius cheated his partner? Can this guilt belong to\n            this man? who, in truth, (I say it boldly,) has more honesty than skill, more truth than\n            learning; whom the Roman people think even a better man than he is an actor; who is as\n            worthy of the stage because of his skill, as he is wholly of the senate on account of\n            his moderation.  But why am I so foolish as to say\n            anything about Roscius to Piso? I suppose I am recommending an unknown man in many\n            words. Is there any man in the whole world of whom you have a better opinion? Is there\n            any man who appears to you more pure, more modest, more humane, more regardful of his\n            duty, more liberal? Have even you, O Saturius, who appear against him, have you a\n            different opinion? Is it not true that as often as you have mentioned his name in the\n            cause, you have said that he was a good man, and have spoken of him with expressions of\n            respect? which no one is in the habit of doing except in the case of either a most\n            honorable man, or of a most dear friend.  While doing\n            so, in truth, you appeared to me ridiculously inconstant in both injuring and praising\n            the same man; in calling him at the same time a most excellent man and a most dishonest\n            man. You were speaking of the man with respect, and calling him a most exemplary man,\n            and at the same time you were accusing him of having cheated his partner. But I imagine\n            the truth is, your praise was prompted by truth; the accusation by your duty to your\n            client. You were speaking of Roscius as you really thought; you were conducting the\n            cause according to the will of Chaerea.

But let us see whom he has\n            cheated. Roscius has cheated Caius Fannius Chaerea.

Does he not from his toe-nails to\n            his head, if the voiceless figure of a man's person can enable men to conjecture his\n            character, seem wholly made up of fraud, and cheating, and lies? He who has his head and\n            eyebrows always shaved that he may not be said to have one hair of an honest man about\n            him. And Roscius has been accustomed to represent his figure admirably on the stage, and\n            yet he does no meet with the gratitude due to such kindness. For when he acts Ballio,\n            that most worthless and perjured pimp, he represents Chaerea. That foul, and impure, and\n            detestable character is represented in this man's manners, and nature, and life. And why\n            he should have thought Roscius like himself in dishonesty and wickedness, I do not know;\n            unless, perhaps, because he observed that he imitated himself admirably in the character\n            of the pimp.  Wherefore consider over and over again,\n            O Caius Piso, who is said to have cheated, and who to have been cheated. Roscius is said\n            to have cheated Fannius? What is that? The honest man is said to have cheated the rogue;\n            the modest man, the shameless one; the chaste man, the perjurer; the unpractised man,\n            the cunning one; the liberal man is said to have cheated the covetous one. It is\n            incredible how, if Fannius were said to have cheated Roscius, each fact would appear\n            probable from the character of each man; both that Fannius had acted wickedly, and that\n            Roscius had been cheated by his imprudence. So when Roscius is accused of having cheated\n            Fannius, both parts of the story are incredible, both that Roscius should have sought\n            anything covetously, and that Fannius should have lost anything by his good-nature."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "23", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "24", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "9", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "25", "@unit": "section"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "Dionysia was a celebrated dancer."}, {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "formulae"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "formulae"}], "bibl": ["Cic. pro Rosc.

He says, for the sake of the fifty thousand\n              . I see; but yet I ask why he was so exceedingly\n            desirous of this particular fifty thousand ? For\n            certainly, O Marcus Perperna and Caius Piso, they would not have been of such\n            consequence to either of you, as to make you cheat your partner. I ask, then, why they\n            were of such consequence to Roscius! Was he in want of money? No, he was even a rich\n            man. Was he in debt? On the contrary, he was living within his income. Was he\n            avaricious? far from it; even before he was a rich man he was always most liberal and\n            munificent.  Oh, in the name of good faith, of gods,\n            and men! he who once refused to make a gain of three hundred thousand for he certainly both could and would have earned three\n            hundred thousand  if Dionysia  can earn two hundred thousand,did\n            he seek to acquire fifty thousand by the greatest dishonesty, and wickedness and\n            treachery? And that sum was immense, this trifling; that was honourable, this sordid;\n            that was pleasant, this bitter; that would have been his own, this must have been stated\n            on an action and a trial. In these last ten years he might have earned six millions of\n               most honourably. He would not; he undertook the\n            labour entitled to gain, but refused the gain of his labour. He did not yet desist from\n            serving the Roman people; he has long since ceased to benefit himself.  Would you even do this, O Fannius? And if you were able to receive\n            such profits, would you not act with all your gestures, and even at the risk of your\n            life? Say now that you have been cheated of fifty thousand  by Roscius, who has refused such enormous sums, not because he\n            was too indolent to labour for them, but out of a magnificence of liberality. What now\n            shall I say of these things which I know to a certainty occur to your minds, O judges?\n            Roscius cheated you in a partnership. There are laws, there are formularies  established for\n            every case, that no one may make a blunder, either as to the legal description of injury\n            which he has suffered, or as to the sort of action he should bring; for public formulae\n            have been given by the praetor to suit every evil, or vexation, or inconvenience, or\n            calamity, or injury which any one can suffer and to them each private action is adapted."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "26", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "10", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "And as this is the case, I ask why you have not Roscius as your partner before an\n            arbitrator?

Oh, the matter was\n            evident, the theft was undeniable. A theft of what?

He\n            who settles his own demand only, leaves to the rest their right of action unimpaired; he\n            who acts for his partners, gives security that none of them shall afterwards make any\n            demand. Why did it not occur to Flavius to take this precaution for himself? Was he,\n            forsooth, not aware that Panurgus belonged to a partnership. He knew that. Was he not\n            aware that Fannius was Roscius' partner? Thoroughly; for he himself had a law-suit\n            commenced with him.  Why then does he settle this\n            action, and not exact an agreement that no one shall make any further demand on him? Why\n            does he lose the farm, and yet get no release from this action? Why does he act in so\n            inexperienced a manner, as neither to bind Roscius by any stipulation, nor on the other\n            hand to get a release from Fannius' action?  This\n            first argument, drawn both from the rules of civil rights, and from the customs\n            prevailing with respect to such security, is a most important and powerful one, which I\n            would press at greater length, if I had not other more undeniable and manifest proofs in\n            the cause."}, {"persName": [{"surname": "Piso"}, {"surname": "Piso"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "38", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "39", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "14", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "40", "@unit": "section"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}], "#text": "And that you may not say I have promised this on insufficient grounds, I will call\n            youyou, I say, Fanniusfrom your seat as a witness against\n            yourself.What is your charge?

For who\n            is influenced by just a mention of the gods in the way of deprecating their anger, and\n            not by the influence of conscience? Because the same punishment which is appointed by\n            the immortal gods for a perjurer is appointed also for a liar.

Truth itself lays its hand upon me, and compels me to stop, and\n            dwell on this point for a short time. Whence was all this lie drawn, and where was it\n            forged? Roscius, forsooth, is a deep and crafty man. He began to think of this from the\n            first. Since, said he to himself, Fannius claims fifty thousand  from me, I will ask Caius Cluvius, a Roman knight, a most\n            accomplished man, to tell a lie for my sake; to say that a settlement was made which was\n            not made; that a hundred thousand  were given by\n            Flavius to Fannius, which were not given. This is the first idea of a wicked mind, of a\n            miserable disposition, of a man of no sense. What came next?  After he had thoroughly made up his mind, he came to Cluvius. What\n            sort of a man was he? an insignificant man? No, a most influential one. A fickle man? A\n            most consistent one. An intimate friend of his? A perfect stranger.

Or would Cluvius have granted it to Roscius at his request, even if\n            he had been to be a sharer in the whole booty? I scarcely, by the gods, think that you,\n            O Fannius, would dare to make this request to Ballio, or to any one like him; and that\n            you would be able to succeed in a matter not only false, but in its nature incredible.\n            For I say nothing about Roscius and Cluvius being excellent men. I imagine them for this\n            occasion to be worthless.  Roscius, then, suborned\n            Cluvius as a false witness. Why did he do it so late? Why did he do so when the second\n            payment was to be made, not when the first was? for already he had paid fifty thousand\n            sesterce. Secondly; if Cluvius was, by this time, persuaded to tell lies, why did he say\n            that a hundred thousand  had been given to Fannius\n            by Flavius, rather than three hundred thousand; when, according to the mutual agreement,\n            a half-share of it belonged to Roscius.

When\n            Saturius perceives that this is proved, he does not dare to resist and struggle against\n            the truth. He finds another subterfuge of dishonesty and treachery in the same track.\n               I admit, says he,\n            that Roscius demanded his own share from Flavius; I admit that he left\n            Fannius's right to make a similar demand entire and unimpaired; but I contend that what\n            he got for himself became the common property of the partnership than which\n            nothing more tricky or more scandalous can be said. For I ask whether Roscius had the\n            power to demand his share from the partnership, or not? If he could not, how did he get\n            it? If he could, how was it that he did not demand it for himself? For that which is\n            demanded for one's self, is certainly not exacted for another.  Is it so? If he had made a demand of what belonged to the entire\n            partnership, all would equally have shared what then came in. Now, when he demanded what\n            was a part of his own share, did he not demand for himself alone what he got?"}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "54", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "55", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "56", "@unit": "section"}], "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, "#text": "What is the difference between him who goes to law for himself, and him who is assigned\n            as agent for another? He who commences an action for himself, makes his demand for\n            himself alone. No one can prefer a claim for another except him who is constituted his\n            agent. Is it not so? If her had been your agent, you would get your own, because he had\n            gained the action. But he preferred this claim in his own name; so what he got he got\n            for himself, and not for you.  But if any one can make\n            a claim on behalf of another, who is not appointed his agent, I ask why then, when\n            Panurgus was slain, and an action was commenced against Fannius on the plea of injury\n            sustained by the loss, you were made the agent of Roscius for that action? especially\n            when, according to what you now say, whatever claim you made for yourself you made for\n            him; whatever recompense you exacted for yourself, would belong to the partnership. But\n            if nothing would have come to Roscius which you had got from Flavius, unless he had\n            appointed you agent for his action, so nothing ought to come to you which Roscius has\n            exacted for his share, since he was not appointed your agent.  For what answer can you make to this case, O Fannius? When Roscius\n            settled with Flavius for his own share, did he leave you your right of action, or not?\n            If he did not leave it you, how was it that you afterwards exacted a hundred thousand\n               from him? If he did leave it, why do you claim\n            from him what you ought to demand and follow up yourself? For partnership is very like\n            inheritance, and, as it were, its twin sister. As a partner has a share in a\n            partnership, so an heir has a share in an inheritance. As an heir prefers a claim for\n            himself alone, and not for his co-heirs, so a partner prefers a claim for himself alone,\n            and not for his partners. And as each prefers a claim for his own share, so he makes\n            payments for his share alone; the heir, out of the share which he has received of the\n            inheritance the partner, out of that property with which he entered into the\n            partnership.  As Roscius could have executed a release\n            to Flavius in his own name, so as to prevent you from preferring any claim; so, as he\n            only exacted his own share, and left you your right to prefer a claim unimpaired, he\n            ought not to share what he got with youunless, indeed, you, by a perversion\n            of all justice, are able to rob him of what is his, though you are not able to extort\n            your own rights from another.

But if that be true, how\n            great (plague take it!) was the folly of Roscius, who, by the advice and influence of\n            lawyers, made a mutual agreement with Fannius, very carefully, that he should pay him\n            half of whatever he got from Flavius; if indeed, without any security or mutual\n            agreement, nevertheless, Fannius owed it to the partnership; that is to say, to Roscius\n            [The rest of this speech is lost.]"}]}}, {"@n": "Div.

Cicero replies to this\n              with many reasons why the conduct of the prosecution should be committed to him,\n              especially because he did not volunteer to take it up, but is urged by a sense of\n              duty, being begged to do so by all the Sicilians; and also because he is in ever,\n              respect well able to conduct it, from his acquaintance with the count and with the\n              Sicilians."}, {"foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Divinatio"}, "#text": "There is some question why this speech is called , and different reasons have been alleged for it; some saying\n              that it is because it refers to what is to be done, not to what has been done: others,\n              that it is so called because no witnesses and no documents are produced, and the\n              judges, having to decide on the arguments of the speakers alone, are forced to guess\n              their way.

Caius Verres is said for three\n            years to have depopulated the province of , to have desolated the cities of the Sicilians, to have made the\n            houses empty, to have plundered the temples. The whole nation of the Sicilians is\n            present, and complains of this. They fly for protection to my good faith, which they\n            have proved and long known; they entreat assistance for themselves from you and from the\n            laws of the Roman people through my instrumentality; they desire me to be their defender\n            in these their calamities; they desire me to be the avenger of their injuries, the\n            advocate of their rights, and the pleader of their whole cause.  Will you, O Quintus Caecilius, say this, that I have not approached\n            the cause at the request of the Sicilians? or that the desire of those most excellent\n            and most faithful allies ought not to be of great influence with these judges? If you\n            dare to say that which Caius Verres, whose enemy you are pretending to be, wishes\n            especially to be believed,that the Sicilians did not make this request to\n            me,you will in the first place be supporting the cause of your enemy, against\n            whom it is considered that no vague presumption, but that an actual decision has been\n            come to, in the fact that has become notorious, that all the Sicilians have begged for\n            me as their advocate against his injuries.  If you,\n            his enemy, deny that this is the case, which he himself to whom the fact is most\n            injurious does not dare to deny, take care lest you seem to carry on your enmity in too\n            friendly a manner. In the second place, there are witnesses, the most illustrious men of\n            our state, all of whom it is not necessary that I should name, those who are present I\n            will appeal to; while, if I were speaking falsely, they are the men whom I should least\n            wish to be witnesses of my impudence. He, who is one of the assessors on this bid, Caius\n            Marcellus, knows it; he, whom I see here present, Cnaeus Lentulus Marcellinus, knows it;\n            on whose good faith and protection the Sicilians principally depend, because the whole\n            of that province is inalienably connected with the name of the Marcelli.  These men know that this request was not only made to me, but\n            that it was made so frequently and with such earnestness, that I had no alternative\n            except either to undertake the cause, or to repudiate the duty of friendship. But why do\n            I cite these men as witnesses, as if the matter were doubtful or unknown? Most noble men\n            are present here from the whole province, who being present, beg and entreat you, O\n            judges, not to let your judgment differ from their judgment in selecting an advocate for\n            their cause. Deputations from every city in the whole of , except two,  are present; and if deputations from\n            those two were present also, two of the very most serious of the crimes would be\n            lessened in which these cities are implicated with Caius Verres.  But why have they entreated this protection from me above all men? If\n            it were doubtful whether they had entreated it from me or not, I could tell why they had\n            entreated it; but now, when it is so evident that you can see it with your eyes, I know\n            not why it should be any injury to me to have it imputed to me that I was selected above\n            all men.  But I do not arrogate any such thing to\n            myself, and I not only do not say it, but I do not wish even to leave any one to believe\n            that I have been preferred to every possible advocate. That is not the fact but a\n            consideration of the opportunities of each individual and of his health, and of his\n            aptitude for conducting this cause, has been taken into account. My desire and\n            sentiments on this matter have always been these, that I would rather that any one of\n            those who are fit for it should undertake it than I; but I had rather that I should\n            undertake it myself than that no one should."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "18", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "19", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "20", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "6", "@unit": "chapter"}], "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, "#text": "The next thing is, since it is evident that the Sicilians have demanded this of me, for\n            us to inquire whether it is right that this fact should have any influence on you and on\n            your judgments; whether the allies of the Roman people, your suppliants, ought to have\n            any weight with you in a matter of extortion committed on themselves.

In trials like this between Cicero and\n              Caecilius it is probable that the two tabellae had the names of the different\n              candidates inscribed on them. The circumstance alluded to in the text was that a short\n              time before this Terentius Varro had been accused of extortion and defended by\n              Hortensius, who bribed the judges, and then in order to be sure that they voted as\n              they had promised, caused tablets to be given to them smeared with coloured wax, so\n              that he could easily recognize their votes in the balloting urn."}], "#text": "But this is a well established fact, that the Sicilians especially desire to have me\n            for their counsel; the other point, no doubt, is less clear,namely, by whom\n            Verres would least like to be prosecuted! Did any one ever strive so openly for any\n            honour, or so earnestly for his own safety, as that man and his friends have striven to\n            prevent this prosecution from being entrusted to me? There are many qualities which\n            Verres believes to be in me, and which he knows, O Quintus Caecilius, do not exist in\n            you: and what qualities each of us have I will mention presently;  at this moment I will only say this, which you must silently agree\n            to, that there is no quality in me which he can despise, and none in you which he can\n            fear. Therefore, that great defender  and friend\n            of his votes for you and opposes me; he openly solicits the judges to have you preferred\n            to me; and he says that he does this honestly, without any envy of me, and without any\n            dislike to me. For, says he, I am now asking for that\n            which I usually obtain when I strive for it earnestly. I am not asking to have the\n            defendant acquitted; but I am asking this, that he may be accused by the one man rather\n            than by the other. Grant me this; grant that which is easy to grant, and honourable, and\n            by no means invidious; and when you have granted that, you will, without any risk to\n            yourself, and without any discredit, have granted that he shall be acquitted in whose\n            cause I am labouring.  He says also, in\n            order that some alarm may be mingled with the exertion of his influence, that there are\n            certain men on the bench to whom he wishes their tablets to be shown, and that that is\n            very easy, for that they do not give their votes separately, but that all vote together;\n            and that a tablet,  covered with\n            the proper wax, and not with that illegal wax which has given so much scandal, is given\n            to every one. And he does not give himself all this trouble so much for the sake of\n            Verres, as because he disapproves of the whole affair. For he sees that, if the power of\n            prosecuting is taken away from the high-born boys whom he has hitherto played with, and\n            from the public informers, whom he has always despised and thought insignificant (not\n            without good reason), and to be transferred to fearless men of well-proved constancy, he\n            will no longer be able to domineer over the courts of law as he pleases."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "26", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "9", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "I now beforehand give this man notice, that if you determine that this cause shall be\n            conducted by me, his whole plan of defence must be altered, and must be altered in such\n            a manner as to be carried on in a more honest and honourable way than he likes; that he\n            must imitate those most illustrious men whom he himself has seen, Lucius Crassus and\n            Marcus Antonius; who thought that they had no right to bring anything to the trials and\n            causes in which their friends were concerned, except good faith and ability.

First of all, he must have a singular integrity and\n            innocence. For there is nothing which is less tolerable than for him to demand an\n            account of his life from another who cannot give an account of his own. Here I will not\n            say any more of yourself.  This one thing, I think,\n            all may observe, that up to this time you had no opportunity of becoming known to any\n            people except to the Sicilians; and that the Sicilians say this, that even though they\n            are exasperated against the same man, whose enemy you say that you are, still, if you\n            are the advocate, they will not appear on the trial. Why they refuse to, you will not\n            hear from me. Allow these judges to suspect what it is inevitable that they must. The\n            Sicilians, indeed, being a race of men over-acute, and too much inclined to\n            suspiciousness, suspect that you do not wish to bring documents from  against Verres; but, as both his praetorship and\n            your quaestorship are recorded in the same documents, they suspect that you wish to\n            remove  them out of .  In the second place, an\n            accuser must be trustworthy and veracious. Even if I were to think that you were\n            desirous of being so, I easily see that you are not able to be so. Nor do I speak of\n            these things, which, if I were to mention, you would not be able to invalidate, namely\n            that you, before you departed from , had\n            become reconciled to Verres; that Potamo, your secretary and intimate friend, was\n            retained by Verres in the province when you left it; that Marcus Caecilius, your\n            brother, a most exemplary and accomplished young man, is not only not present here and\n            does not stand by you while prosecuting your alleged injuries, but that he is with\n            Verres, and is living on terms of the closest friendship and intimacy with him. These,\n            and other things belonging to you, are many signs of a false accuser; but these I do not\n            now avail myself of. I say this, that you, if you were to wish it ever so much, still\n            cannot be a faithful accuser.

Will\n            you pass over this serious accusation, or will you bring it forward? If you bring it\n            forward, will you charge that as a crime against another, which you did yourself at the\n            same time in the same province? Will you dare so to accuse another, that you cannot\n            avoid at the same time condemning yourself? If you omit the charge, what sort of a\n            prosecution will yours be, which from fear of danger to yourself, is afraid not only to\n            create a suspicion of a most certain and enormous crime, but even to make the least\n            mention of it? Corn was bought, on the authority of a decree of the senate, of the\n            Sicilians while Verres was praetor;  for which corn\n            all the money was not paid. This is a grave charge against Verres; a grave one if I\n            plead the cause, but, if you are the prosecutor, no charge at all. For you were the\n            quaestor, you had the handling of the public money; and, even if the praetor desired it\n            ever so much, yet it was to a great extent in your power to prevent anything being taken\n            from it. Of this crime, therefore, if you are the prosecutor, no mention will be made.\n            And so during the whole trial nothing will be said of his most enormous and most\n            notorious thefts and injuries. Believe me, O Caecilius, he who is connected with the\n            criminal in a partnership of iniquity, cannot really defend his associates while\n            accusing him.  The contractors exacted money from the\n            cities instead of corn. Well! was this never done except in the praetorship of Verres? I\n            do not say that, but it was done while Caecilius was quaestor. What then will you do?\n            Will you urge against this man as a charge, what you both could and ought to have\n            prevented from being done? or will you leave out the whole of it? Verres, then, at his\n            trial will absolutely never hear at all of those things, which, when he was doing them,\n            he did not know how he should be able to defend."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "34", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "35", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "36", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "12", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "37", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "And I am mentioning those matters which lie on the surface.

So that if you demand to be allowed to give\n            information of the crimes which Verres has committed in conjunction with you, I have no\n            objection, if it is allowed by the law.

For I do not ask what you will say yourself, I see that it is\n            not you who will answer me, but this book which your prompter has in his hand; who, if\n            he be inclined to prompt you rightly, will advise you to depart from this place and not\n            to answer me one word. For what can you say? That which you are constantly repeating,\n            that Verres has done you an injury? I have no doubt he has, for it would not be\n            probable, when he was doing injuries to all the Sicilians, that you alone should be so\n            important in his eyes that he should take care of your interests.  But the rest of the Sicilians have found an avenger of their\n            injuries; you, while you are endeavouring to exact vengeance for your injuries by your\n            own means, (which you will not be able to effect,) are acting in a way to leave the\n            injuries of all the rest unpunished and unavenged. And you do not see that it ought not\n            alone to be considered who is a proper person to exact vengeance, but also who is a\n            person capable of doing so,that if there be a man in whom both these\n            qualifications exist, he is the best man.  But if a\n            man has only one of them, then the question usually asked is, not what he is inclined to\n            do, but what he is able to do. And if you think that the office of prosecutor ought to\n            be entrusted to him above all other men, to whom Caius Verres has done the greatest\n            injury, which do you think the judges ought to be most indignant at,at your\n            having been injured by him, or at the whole province of  having been harassed and ruined by him? I think you must grant\n            that this both is the worst thing of the two, and that it ought to be considered the\n            worst by every one.

Allow me to relate\n            it. For he indeed, unless he is wholly destitute of sense, will never say what it is.\n            There is a woman of the name of Agonis, a Lilybaean, a freedwoman of Venus Erycina; a\n            woman who before this man was quaestor was notoriously well off and rich. From her some\n            prefect of Antonius's  carried off\n            some musical slaves whom he said he wished to use in his fleet. Then she, as is the\n            custom in  for all the slaves of\n            , and all those who have procured their\n            emancipation from her, in order to hinder the designs of the prefect, by the scruples\n            which the name of  would raise, said that\n            she and all her property belonged to Venus.  When this\n            was reported to Caecilius, that most excellent and upright man, he ordered Agonis to be\n            summoned before him; he immediately orders a trial to ascertain if it\n            appeared that she had said that she and all her property belonged to Venus.\n            The recuperators  decide all that was necessary, and indeed there was no\n            doubt at all that she had said so. He sends men to take possession of the woman's\n            property. He adjudges her herself to be again a slave of Venus; then he sells her\n            property and confiscates the money. So while Agonis wishes to keep a few slaves under\n            the name and religious protection of Venus, she loses all her fortunes and her own\n            liberty by the wrong doing of that man. After that, Verres comes to ; he takes cognisance of the affair; he\n            disapproves of the act; he compels his quaestor to pay back and restore to its owner all\n            the money which he had confiscated, having been received for the property of Agonis.\n               He is here, and you may well admire it, no longer\n            Verres, but Quintus Mucius.  For\n            what could he do more delicate to obtain a high character among men? what more just to\n            relieve the distress of the women? what more severe to repress the licentiousness of his\n            quaestor? All this appears to me most exceedingly praiseworthy. But at the very next\n            step, in a moment, as if he had drank of some Circaean cup, having been a man, he\n            becomes Verres again; he returns to himself and to his old habits.

Secondly,\n            I say that of the injury which was done to you no one of us ought to be a more severe\n            avenger than you yourself, to whom it is said to have been done.

What shall I say if even the pretext of that injury which was done to\n            you by him no longer remains? What have you then to say why you should be preferred, I\n            will not say to me, but to any one? except that which I hear you intend to say, that you\n            were his quaestor: which indeed would be an important allegation if you were contending\n            with me as to which of us ought to be the most friendly to him; but in a contention as\n            to which is to take up a quarrel against him, it is ridiculous to suppose that an\n            intimate connection with him can be a just reason for bringing him into danger.\n               In truth, if you had received ever so many injuries\n            from your praetor, still you would deserve greater credit by bearing them than by\n            revenging them; but when nothing in his life was ever done more rightly than that which\n            you call an injury, shall these judges determine that this cause, which they would not\n            even tolerate in any one else, shall appear in your case to be a reasonable one to\n            justify the violation of your ancient connection?

But if no injury has been done you at all, you cannot\n            accuse him without wickedness; and as it is very uncertain whether any injury has been\n            done you, do you think that there is any one of these men who would not prefer that you\n            should depart without incurring blame rather than after having committed wickedness?"}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "62", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "63", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "20", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "64", "@unit": "section"}], "persName": {"surname": "Julius"}, "#text": "And just think how great is the difference between my opinion and yours. You, though\n            you are in every respect inferior to me, still think that you ought to be preferred to\n            me for this one reason, because you were his quaestor. I think, that if you were my\n            superior in every other qualification, still that for this one cause alone you ought to\n            be rejected as the prosecutor. For this is the principle which has been handed down to\n            us from our ancestors, that a praetor ought to be in the place of a parent to his\n            quaestor; that no more reasonable nor more important cause of intimate friendship can be\n            imagined than a connection arising from drawing the same lot, having the same province,\n            and being associated in the discharge of the same public duty and office.  Wherefore, even if you could accuse him without violating\n            strict right, still, as he had been in the place of a parent to you, you could not do so\n            without violating every principle of piety. But as you have not received any injury, and\n            would yet be creating danger for your praetor, you must admit that you are endeavouring\n            to wage an unjust and impious war against him. In truth, your quaestorship is an\n            argument of so strong a nature, that you would have to take a great deal of pains to\n            find an excuse for accusing him to whom you had acted as quaestor, and can never be a\n            reason why you should claim on that account to have the office of prosecuting him\n            entrusted to you above all men. Nor indeed, did any one who had acted as quaestor to\n            another, ever contest the point of being allowed to accuse him without being rejected.\n               And therefore, neither was permission given to\n            Lucius Philo to bring forward an accusation against Caius Servilius, nor to Marcus\n            Aurelius Scaurus to prosecute Lucius Flaccus, nor to Cnaeus Pompeius to accuse Titus\n            Albucius; not one of whom was refused this, permission because of any personal\n            unworthiness, but in order that the desire to violate such an intimate connection might\n            not be sanctioned by the authority of the judges. And that great man Cnaeus Pompeius\n            contended about that matter with Caius ,\n            just as you are contending with me. For he had been the quaestor of Albucius, just as\n            you were of Verres: Julius had on his side this reason for conducting the prosecution,\n            that, just as we have now been entreated by the Sicilians, so he had then been entreated\n            by the Sardinians, to espouse their cause. And this argument has always had the greatest\n            influence; this has always been the most honourable cause for acting as accuser, that by\n            so doing one is bringing enmity on oneself in behalf of allies, for the sake of the\n            safety of a province, for the advantage of foreign nationsthat one is for\n            their sakes incurring danger, and spending much care and anxiety and labour."}, {"persName": [{"surname": "Piso"}, {"surname": "Piso"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "65", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "66", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "21", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "Even if the cause of those men who wish to revenge their own injuries be ever so\n            strong, in which matter they are only obeying their own feelings of indignation, not\n            consulting the advantage of the republic: how much more honourable is that cause, which\n            is not only reasonable, but which ought to be acceptable to all,that a man,\n            without having received any private injury to himself, should be influenced by the\n            sufferings and injuries of the allies and friends of the Roman people!

They think that, if this custom begins gradually to creep\n            on and advance, the laws will be put in execution, and actions will be conducted by\n            honourable and fearless men, and not by unskillful youths, or informers of this sort.\n               Of which custom and principle our fathers and\n            ancestors did not repent when Publius Lentulus, he who was chief of the Senate,\n            prosecuted Marcus Aquillius, having Caius Rutilius Rufus backing the accusation; or when\n            Publius Africanus, a man most eminent for valour, for good fortune, for renown, and for\n            exploits, after he had been twice consul and had been censor brought Lucius Cotta to\n            trial Then the name of the Roman people was rightly held in high honour; rightly was the\n            authority of this empire and the majesty of the state considered illustrious. Nobody\n            marveled in the case of that great man Africanus, as they now pretend to marvel with\n            respect to me, a man endowed with but moderate influence and moderate talents, just\n            because they are annoyed at me;  What can\n            he be meaning? does he want to be considered a prosecutor who hitherto has been\n            accustomed to defend people? and especially now at the age when he is seeking the\n            aedileship? But I think it becomes not my age only, but even a much greater\n            age, and I think it an action consistent with the highest dignity to accuse the wicked,\n            and to defend the miserable and distressed. And in truth, either this is a remedy for a\n            republic diseased and in an almost desperate condition, and for tribunals corrupted and\n            contaminated by the vices and baseness of a few, for men of the greatest possible honour\n            and uprightness and modesty to undertake to uphold the stability of the laws, and the\n            authority of the courts of justice; or else, if this is of no advantage, no medicine\n            whatever will ever be found for such terrible and numerous evils as these.

What would you do for an innocent man or\n                for a relation, when for the sake of a most guilty man, entirely unconnected with\n                you, you depart from your duty and your dignity, and allow what he is constantly\n                saying to appear true to any one who is not acquainted with you?  For they said that Verres said, that you had not been made consul\n                by destiny, as the rest of your family had been, but by his assistance. Two consuls,\n                therefore, and the judge are to be such because of his will. We shall not only, says\n                he, avoid having a man too scrupulous in investigating, too subservient to the\n                opinion of the people, Marcus Glabrio, but we shall have this advantage\n                also:Marcus Caesonius is the judge, the colleague of our accuser a man of\n                tried and proved experience in the decision of actions. It will never do for us to\n                have such a man as that on the bench, which we are endeavouring to corrupt by some\n                means or other; for before, when he was one of the Judges on the tribunal of which\n                Junius  was president, he was not only very indignant at that shameful\n                transaction, but he even betrayed and denounced it. After the first of January we\n                shall not have this man for our judge,\n                we shall not have Quintus Manlius and Quintus Cornificius, two most severe and\n                upright judges, for judges, because they will then be tribunes of the people.\n                Publius Sulpicius, a solemn and upright judge, must enter on his magistracy on the\n                fifth of November.

O splendid reputation of our order! when the allies\n                of the Roman people are unwilling that trials for extortion should take place, which\n                were instituted by our ancestors for the sake of the allies. Would that man ever\n                have had a favourable hope of his own safety, if he had not conceived in his mind a\n                bad opinion of you? on which account, he ought, if possible, to be still more hated\n                by you than he is by the Roman people, because he considers you like himself in\n                avarice and wickedness and perjury."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "44", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "45", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "16", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "46", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "And I beg you, in the name of the immortal gods, O judges, think of and guard\n                against this; I warn you, I give notice to you, of what I am well assured, that this\n                most seasonable opportunity has been given to you by the favour of the gods, for the\n                purpose of delivering your whole order from hatred, from unpopularity, from infamy,\n                and from disgrace.

Moreover, he is a\n                criminal of such a sort, that there is absolutely nothing whatever in him except the\n                greatest crimes, and excessive riches; so that if he be acquitted, no other opinion\n                can be formed of the matter except that which is the most discreditable possible.\n                Such numerous and enormous vices as his will not be considered to have been canceled\n                by influence, by family connection, by some things which may have been done well, or\n                even by the minor vices of flattery and subservience.  In short, I will conduct the cause in this manner; I will bring\n                forward things of such a sort, so well known, so proved by evidence, so important,\n                and so undeniable, that no one shall venture to use his influence to obtain from you\n                the acquittal of that man; for I have a sure path and method by which I can\n                investigate and become acquainted with all their endeavours. The matter will be so\n                managed by me that not only the ears but even the eyes of the Roman people shall\n                seem to be present at all their counsels.  You\n                have in your power to remove and to eradicate the disgrace and infamy which has now\n                for many years attached to your order. It is evident to all men, that since these\n                tribunals have been established which we now have, there has never been a bench of\n                judges of the same splendour and dignity as this.  If anything is done wrongly in this case, all men\n                will think not that other more capable judges should be appointed of the same order\n                of men, which is not possible; but that another order must be sought for, from which\n                to select the judges for the future."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "51", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "52", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "18", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "53", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Lex Acilia"}, "#text": "The  was carried by Marcus\n                  Acilius Glabrio, the father of this Glabrio, when tribune of the people; it\n                  abridged the proceedings in trials for extortion, and did not allow of the\n                  adjournment and delays which were permitted by previously existing laws."}, "#text": "On which account, in the first place, I beg this of the immortal gods, which I seem\n                to myself to have hopes of too, that in this trial no one may be found to be wicked\n                except him who has long since been found to be such; secondly, if there are many\n                wicked men, I promise this to you, O judges, I promise this to the Roman people,\n                that my life shall fail rather than my vigour and perseverance in prosecuting their\n                iniquity.

And\n                this credit that fellow says that he shares in common with me; since when he\n                rejected Publius Galba as judge, he retained Marcus Lucretius; and when, upon this,\n                his patron asked him why he had allowed his most intimate friends Sextus Paeduceus,\n                Quintus Considius, and Quintus Junius, to be objected to, he answered, because he\n                knew them to be too much attached to their own ideas and opinions in coming to a\n                decision.

Judges, consider and deliberate what becomes your fame, your reputation, and the\n                common safety? Your eminence prevents your being able to make any mistake without\n                the greatest injury and danger to the republic. For the Roman people cannot hope\n                that there are any other men in the senate who can judge uprightly, if you cannot.\n                It is inevitable that, when it has learnt to despair of the whole order, it should\n                look for another class of men and another system of judicial proceedings. If this\n                seems to you at all a trifling matter, because you think the being judges a grave\n                and inconvenient burden, you ought to be aware, in the first place, that it makes a\n                difference whether you throw off that burden yourselves, of your own accord, or\n                whether the power of sitting as judges is taken away from you because you have been\n                unable to convince the Roman people of your good faith and scrupulous honesty. In\n                the second place, consider this also, with what great danger we shall come before\n                those judges whom the Roman people, by reason of its hatred to you, has willed shall\n                judge concerning you.

It is not my fear for your\n                good faith, O judges, which has urged me to lay these considerations before you at\n                some length, but the new hopes which those men are entertaining; for when those\n                hopes had brought Verres suddenly back from the gates of the city to this court,\n                some men suspected that his intention had not been changed so suddenly without a\n                cause."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "25", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "26", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "10", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Now, in order that Hortensius may not be able to employ any new sort of complaint,\n                and to say that a defendant is oppressed if the accuser says nothing about him; that\n                nothing is so dangerous to the fortunes of an innocent man as for his adversaries to\n                keep silence; and in order that he may not praise my abilities in a way which I do\n                not like, when he says that, if I had said much, I should have relieved him against\n                whom I was speaking, and that I have undone him because I said nothing,I\n                will comply with his wishes, I shall employ one long unbroken speech: not because it\n                is necessary, but that I may try whether he will be most vexed at my having been\n                silent then or at my speaking now.

When Dio himself came forward, and the\n                others who had at that time been engaged in  on Dio's business, when, at the very time when Dio was\n                pleading his cause, he was proved to have borrowed money, to have galled in all that\n                was owing to him, to have sold farms; when the accounts of respectable men were\n                produced, when they who had supplied Dio with money said that they had heard at the\n                time that the money was taken on purpose to be given to Verres; when the friends,\n                and connections, and patrons of Dio, most honourable men, said that they had heard\n                the same thing.  Then, when this was going on, you\n                would, I suppose, attend as you did attend. Then the cause would seem to be going\n                on. Everything was managed by me in the former pleading so that among all the\n                charges there was not one in which any one of you desired an uninterrupted statement\n                of the case.

For you can easily avoid one who is openly an adversary, by\n                guarding against him; but this secret, internal, and domestic evil not only exists,\n                but even overwhelms you before you can foresee it or examine into it.

For as he proceeded\n                on his journey to the province, wherever he went his conduct was such, that it was\n                not some lieutenant of the Roman people, but rather some calamity that seemed to be\n                going through the country."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7002733", "#text": "Achaia"}, {"@key": "tgn,7002733", "#text": "Achaia"}, {"@key": "perseus,Athens", "#text": "Athens"}, {"@key": "perseus,Delos", "#text": "Delos"}, {"@key": "perseus,Delos", "#text": "Delos"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "45", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "46", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "18", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "In , (I will omit all minor things,\n                to some of which perhaps some one else may some time or other have done something\n                like; I will mention nothing except what is unprecedented, nothing except what would\n                appear incredible, if it were alleged against any other criminal,) he demanded money\n                from a Sicyonian magistrate.

For Servilius, as a\n                general of the Roman people, took \n                after you, as lieutenant of the quaestor in the same district, had taken care to\n                harass and plunder all the cities of our friends and allies even when they were at\n                peace.  The things which you carried off from the\n                holiest temples with wickedness, and like a robber, we cannot see, except in your\n                own houses, or in those of your friends. The statues and decorations which Publius\n                Servilius brought away from the cities of our enemies, taken by his courage and\n                valour, according to the laws of war and his own rights as commander-in-chief, he\n                brought home for the Roman people; he carried them in his triumph, and took care\n                that a description of them should be engraved on public tablets and hid up in the\n                treasury. You may learn from public documents the industry of that most honourable\n                man. ReadThe accounts delivered by Publius\n                Servilius. You see not only the number of the statues, but the size, the\n                figure, and the condition of each one among them accurately described in writing.\n                Certainly, the delight arising from virtue and from victory is much greater than\n                that pleasure which is derived from licentiousness and covetousness. I say that\n                Servilius took much more care to have the booty of the Roman people noted and\n                described, than you took to have your plunder catalogued."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "59", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "60", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "23", "@unit": "chapter"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,1000004", "#text": "Asia"}, {"@key": "tgn,7002733", "#text": "Achaia"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7002733", "#text": "Achaia"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000004", "#text": "Asia"}, {"@key": "tgn,7002611", "#text": "Pamphylia"}], "#text": "You will say that your statues and paintings were also an ornament to the city and\n                forum of the Roman people.

But the allies and foreign nations then\n                first abandoned the hope of saving any of their property and fortunes, because, as\n                it happened, there were at that time very many ambassadors from  and  at , who\n                worshipped in the forum the images of the gods which had been taken from their\n                temples.

Here I do not expect\n                that he will deny that he has many statues, and countless paintings.

The fellow, when he heard this, was so inflamed with desire for that which\n                he had not only not seen himself, but which even he from whom he heard of it had not\n                seen himself, that he said he should like to go to Philodamus immediately. Janitor,\n                his host, who suspected nothing, being afraid that he must have given him some\n                offence himself, endeavoured with all his might to detain him.

Verres, as he was hurried on by that one desire alone, disregarded all\n                his demands and allegations, and ordered Rubrius to be introduced by force into the\n                house of a man who had a right to refuse him admittance."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "66", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "67", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "68", "@unit": "section"}], "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7002579", "#text": "Lampsacus"}, "#text": "On this, Philodamus, when he could not preserve his rights, studied at least to\n                preserve his courtesy and affability.

He even sends his own son, a most excellent\n                youth, out to one of his relations to supper. \n                Rubrius invites Verres's companions; Verres informs them all what there was to be\n                done.

The host encourages them;\n                they demand wine in larger goblets; the banquet proceeds with the conversation and\n                joy of every one. When the business appeared to Rubrius to have got warm enough,\n                I would know of you, O Philodamus, says he, why you\n                do not bid your daughter to be invited in hither to us? The man, who was\n                both a most dignified man, and of mature age, and a parent, was amazed at the speech\n                of the rascal. Rubrius began to urge it. Then he, in order to give some answer, said\n                that it was not the custom of the Greeks for women to sit down at the banquets of\n                men.

And\n                immediately Rubrius orders his slaves to shut the door, and to stand at the doors\n                themselves.  But when Philodamus perceived that\n                what was intended and being prepared was, that violence should be offered to his\n                daughter, he calls his servants to him, he bids them disregard him and defend his\n                daughter, and orders some one to run out and bear the news to his son of this\n                overpowering domestic misfortune. Meantime an uproar arises throughout the whole\n                house; a fight takes place between the slaves of Rubrius and his host. That noble\n                and most honourable man is buffeted about in his own house; every one fights for his\n                own safety. At last Philodamus has a quantity of boiling water thrown over him by\n                Rubrius himself. When the news of this is brought to the son, half dead with alarm\n                he instantly hastens home to bring aid to save the life of his father and the\n                modesty of his sister. All the citizens of , with the same spirit, the moment they heard of it, because\n                both the worth of Philodamus and the enormity of the injury excited them, assembled\n                by night at his house. At this time Cornelius, the lictor of Verres, who had been\n                placed with his slaves by Rubrius, as if on guard, for the purpose of carrying off\n                the woman, is slain; some of the slaves are wounded; Rubrius himself is wounded in\n                the crowd.

No one was found whose opinion and speech was not to\n                this purpose:That it need not be feared, if the Lampsacenes\n                had avenged that man's atrocious wickedness by force and by the sword, that the\n                senate and Roman people would have thought they ought to chastise their city. And if\n                the lieutenants of the Roman people were to establish this law with respect to the\n                allies, and to foreign nations,that they were not to be allowed to\n                preserve the chastity of their children unpolluted by their lusts, it was better to\n                endure anything rather than to live in a state of such violence and\n                bitterness.  As all were of this\n                opinion, and as every one spoke in this tenor, as his own feelings and indignation\n                prompted each individual, all immediately proceeded towards the house where Verres\n                was staying. They began to beat the door with stones, to attack it with weapons, to\n                surround it with wood and faggots, and to apply fire to it. Then the Roman citizens\n                who were dwelling as traders at \n                run together to the spot; they entreat the citizens of  to allow the name of the lieutenancy to have more weight\n                with them than the insult of the lieutenant; they say that they were well aware that\n                he was an infamous and wicked man, but as he had not accomplished what he had\n                attempted, and as he was not going to be at  any longer, their error in sparing a wicked man would be\n                less than that of not sparing a lieutenant.  And\n                so that fellow, far more wicked and infamous than even the notorious Hadrian,  was a good deal more fortunate.\n                He, because Roman citizens could not tolerate his avarice, was burnt alive at\n                   in his own house; and that was\n                thought to have happened to him so deservedly, that all men rejoiced, and no\n                punishment was inflicted for the deed. This man, scorched indeed though he was by\n                the fire made by our allies, yet escaped from those flames and that danger; and has\n                not even yet been able to imagine what he had done, or what had happened to bring\n                him into such great danger. For he cannot say:When I was\n                trying to put down a sedition, when I was ordering corn, when I was collecting money\n                for the soldiers, when in short I was doing something or other for the sake of the\n                republic, because I gave some strict order, because I punished some one, because I\n                threatened some one, all this happened.

How\n                out of a million they became six hundred thousand; how the six hundred thousand\n                tallied so exactly with other accounts,that of the money belonging to\n                Cnaeus Carbo there was also a remainder of six hundred thousand ; and how it was that they were put down as paid to\n                Chrysogonus; why that name occurred on the bottom line of the page, and after an\n                erasure, you will judge.

I will pause on one article, for many are of the same sort.\n                Recite.

Therefore Marcus Scaurus, who accused Cnaeus Dolabella, held him\n                under his power and in subjection. Being a young man, when in prosecuting his\n                inquiries he ascertained the numerous robberies and iniquities of that man, he acted\n                skillfully and warily. He showed him a huge volume full of his exploits; he got from\n                the fellow all he wanted against Dolabella. He brought him forward as a witness; the\n                fellow said everything which he thought the accuser wished him to say.  And of that class of witnesses, men who were accomplices\n                in his robberies, I might have had a great plenty if I had chosen to employ them;\n                who offered of their own accord to go wherever I chose, in order to deliver\n                themselves from the danger of actions, and from a connection with his crimes.

But even if he had made such a\n                will as that, still, after his death no new law ought to have been enacted which\n                should have any effect on his will. I suppose the Voconian law pleased you greatly?\n                You should have imitated Quintus Voconius himself, who did not by his law take away\n                her inheritance from any female whether virgin or matron, but established a law for\n                the future, that no one who after the year of the existing censors should be\n                enrolled in the census, should make either virgin or matron his heir.  In the Voconian law, there is no has made or\n                shall have made.

And in these cases we\n                see that many things are established by law in such a way that things done\n                previously cannot be called in questionthe Cornelian law the law about\n                testaments, the law about money, and many others, in which no new law is established\n                in the nation, but it is established that what has always been an evil action shall\n                be liable to public prosecution up to a certain time.  But if any one establishes any new regulation on any points of\n                civil law, does he allow everything which has been previously done to remain\n                unaltered? Look at the Atinian law, at the Furian law, at the Voconian law itself,\n                as I said before; in short, at every law on the subject of civil rights; you will\n                find in all of them that regulations are established which are only to come into\n                operation after the passing of the law. Those who attribute the greatest importance\n                to the edict, say that the edict of the praetor is an annual law. You embrace more\n                in an edict than you can in a law. If the first of January puts an end to the edict\n                of the praetor, why does not the edict have its birth also on the first of January?\n                Or, is it the case that no one can advance forward by his edict into the year when\n                another man is to be praetor, but that he may retire back into the year when another\n                man has been praetor?

Why do you not guard against this, as it comes under the\n                same class? Because in your expressions you are not thinking of the interests of a\n                class, but of an individual; so that it is perfectly evident that you were\n                influenced by a desire for money. And if you had issued this edict with only a\n                prospective operation, it would have been less iniquitous; still it would have been\n                scandalous: but in that case, though it might have been blamed, it could not have\n                been doubted about, for no one would have broken it. Now it is an edict of such a\n                sort, that any one can see that it was written, not for the people, but for the\n                second heir of Publius Annius.  Therefore, though\n                that heading had been embellished by you with so many words, and with that mercenary\n                preamble, was any praetor found afterwards to draw up an edict in similar style? Not\n                only no one ever did publish such an edict, but no one was ever apprehensive even of\n                any one publishing such an edict. For after your praetorship many people made wills\n                in the same manner, and among them Annia did so lately. She, by the advice of many\n                of her relations, being a wealthy woman, because she was not included in the census,\n                by her will made her daughter her heiress. This, now, is great proof of men's\n                opinion of the singular wickedness of that fellow, that, though Verres had\n                established this of his own accord, yet no one was apprehensive that any one could\n                be found to adopt the rule which he had laid down.

You yourself\n                removed this clause from your Sicilian edict.

Shall the praetor be able, when we are dead, to take away our property and\n                our fortunes from those to whom we give them while alive? He says, I will\n                neither give any right of petition, nor possession. Will you, then, take\n                away from a young girl her purple-bordered robe?

The laws allow it: yet you\n                interpose your authority. He gives to her of his own property in such a manner as\n                not to infringe any law. What do you find to blame in that? Nothing, I think. But I\n                allow you to do so. Forbid it if you can; if you can find any one to listen to you;\n                if any one can possibly obey your order. Will you take away their will from the\n                dead,their property from the living,their rights from all men?\n                Would not the Roman people have avenged itself by force if it had not reserved you\n                for this occasion and for this trial? Since the establishment of the praetorian\n                power, we have always adopted this principle,that if no will was\n                produced, then possession was given to that person who would have had the best right\n                to be the heir, if the deceased had died intestate. Why this is the most righteous\n                principle it is easy to show; but in a matter so established by precedent it is\n                sufficient to point out that all men had previously laid down the law in this way,\n                and that this was the ancient and customary edict."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "116", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "117", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "46", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "118", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Listen to another new edict of the fellow in a case of frequent occurrence; and\n                then, while there is any place where civil law can be learnt, pray send all the\n                youths of  to his lectures. The genius\n                of the man is marvellous; his prudence is marvellous. A man of the name of Minucius\n                died while he was praetor. He left no will. By law his inheritance passed to the\n                Minucian family. If Verres had issued the edict which all praetors both before and\n                after him did issue, possession would have been given to the Minucian family. If any\n                thought himself heir by will, though no will was known, he might proceed by law to\n                put forward his claim to the inheritance; or if he had taken security for the claim,\n                and given security, he then proceeded to try an action for his inheritance. This is\n                the law which, as I imagine, both our ancestors and we ourselves have always been\n                accustomed to. See, now, how that fellow amended it.  He composes an edict;such language that any one can\n                perceive that it was written for the sake of one individual. He all but names the\n                man; he details his whole cause; he disregards right, custom, equity, the edicts of\n                all his predecessors. According to the edict of the city\n                praetor,if any doubt arises about an inheritance, if the possessor does\n                not give security.... What is it to the praetor which is the possessor?\n                Is not this the point which ought to be inquired into, who ought to be the\n                possessor? Therefore, because he is in possession, you do not remove him from the\n                possession. If he were not in possession, you would not give him possession. For you\n                nowhere say so; nor do you embrace anything else in your edict except that cause for\n                which you had received money. What follows is ridiculous.  If any doubt arises about an inheritance, and if\n                testamentary papers are produced before me, sealed with not fewer seals than are\n                required by law, I shall adjudge the inheritance as far as possible according to the\n                testamentary papers. So far is usual. This ought to follow next:\n                If testamentary papers are not produced.... What says he? That\n                he will adjudge it to him who says he is the heir. What, then, is the difference\n                whether testamentary papers are produced or not? If he produces them, though they\n                may have only one seal less than is required by law, you will not give him\n                possession; but if he produces no such papers at all, you will. What shall I say\n                now? That no one else ever issued a similar edict afterwards? A very marvellous\n                thing, truly, that there should have been no one who chose to be considered like\n                that fellow! He himself, in his Sicilian edict, has not this passage. No; for he had\n                received his payment for it. And so in the edict which I have mentioned before,\n                which he issued in , about giving\n                possession of inheritances, he laid down the same rules which all the praetors at\n                   had laid down besides himself.

Did you think those men who were living in\n                the province more worthy to enjoy just laws than we were? Or is one thing just in\n                   and another in ? For you cannot say in this place that there\n                are many things in the province which require to be regulated differently from what\n                they would if they existed at ; at all\n                events not in the case of taking possession of inheritances, or of the inheritances\n                of women. For in both these cases I see that nor only all other magistrates, but\n                that you yourself, have issued edicts word for word the same as those which are\n                accustomed to be issued at . The\n                clauses which, with great disgrace and for a great bribe, you had inserted in your\n                edict at , those alone, I see, you\n                omitted in your Sicilian edict, in order not to incur odium in the province for\n                nothing.  And as, while he was praetor elect, he\n                composed his whole edict at the pleasure of those who bought law of him to secure\n                their own advantage; so also, when he had entered on his office, he used to make\n                decrees contrary to his edict without the slightest scruple. Therefore, Lucius Piso\n                filled many books with the affairs in which he had interposed his authority, because\n                Verres had decreed in a manner contrary to his edict. And I think that you have not\n                forgotten what a multitude and what respectable citizens used to assemble before\n                Piso's seat while that man was praetor, and unless he had had him for a colleague,\n                he would have been stoned in the very forum. But his injuries at that time appeared\n                of less importance, because there was a refuge always ready in the justice and\n                prudence of Piso, whom men could apply to without any labour, or any trouble, or any\n                expense, and even without a patron to recommend them.  For, I entreat you, recall to your recollection, O judges, what\n                licence that fellow took in determining the law; how great a variation there was in\n                his decrees, what open buying and selling of justice; how empty the houses of all\n                those men who were accustomed to be consulted on points of civil law, how full and\n                crammed was the house of Chelidon. And when men had come from that woman to him, and\n                had whispered in his ear, at one time he would recall those between whom he had just\n                decided, and alter his decree; at another time he, without the least scruple, gave a\n                decision between other parties quite contrary to the last decision which he had\n                given only a little while before.  Hence it was\n                that men were found who were even ridiculous in their indignation; some of whom, as\n                you have heard, said that it was not strange that such piggish  justice should be\n                worthless. Others were colder; but still, because they were angry they seemed\n                ridiculous, while they execrated Sacerdos who had spared so worthless a boar. And I\n                should hardly mention these things, for they were not extraordinarily witty, nor are\n                they worthy of the gravity of the present subject, if I did not wish you to\n                recollect that his worthlessness and iniquity were constantly in the mouths of the\n                populace, and had become a common proverb."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7013962", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,2257061", "#text": "Cornelian"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "123", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "124", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "125", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "48", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "But shall I first speak of his arrogance towards the Roman people, or his cruelty?\n                Beyond all question, cruelty is the graver and more atrocious crime.

And indeed a\n                tribune of the people touched on that matter in the public assembly, when he\n                produced in the sight of the Roman people the man whom he had beaten with rods. And\n                I will give you the opportunity of taking cognisance of that business at its proper\n                time.  But who is ignorant with what arrogance he\n                behaved? how he disregarded every one of a low condition, how he despised them, how\n                he did not account the poor to be free men at all? Publius Trebonius made many\n                virtuous and honourable men his heirs; and among them his own freedman. He had had a\n                brother, Aulus Trebonius, a proscribed man. As he wished to make provision for him,\n                he put down in his will, that his heirs should take an oath to manage that not less\n                than half of each man's share should come to Aulus Trebonius, that proscribed\n                brother of his. The freedman takes the oath; the other heirs go to Verres, and point\n                out to him that they ought not to take such an oath; that they should be doing what\n                was contrary to the  law, which\n                forbids a proscribed man to be assisted. They obtain from him authority to refuse\n                the oath. He gives them possession; that I do not find fault with. Certainly it was\n                a scandalous thing for any part of his brother's property to be given to a man who\n                was proscribed and in want. But that freedman thought that he should be committing a\n                wickedness if he did not take the oath in obedience to the will of his patron.\n                   Therefore Verres declares that he will not\n                give him possession of his inheritance, in order that he may not be able to assist\n                his proscribed patron; and also in order that that might serve as a punishment for\n                having obeyed the will of his other patron. You give possession to him who did not\n                take the oath. I admit your right to do so; it is a privilege of the praetor. You\n                take it from him who has taken the oath. According to what precedent? He is aiding a\n                proscribed man. There is a law; there is a punishment established in such a case.\n                What is that to him who is determining the law? Do you blame him because he assisted\n                his patron, who was in distress at the time, or because he attended to the wishes of\n                his other patron, who was dead, from whom he had received the greatest of all\n                benefits? Which of these actions are you blaming? And then that most admirable man,\n                sitting on his curule chair, said this: Can a freedman be heir to a Roman\n                knight of such great wealth?

He died while Caius Sacerdos was\n                praetor. I don't know whether it was not before Verres had begun to announce himself\n                as a candidate for the praetorship. He made Marcus Octavius Ligur his heir. Ligur\n                thus entered upon his inheritance; he took possession while Sacerdos was praetor,\n                without any dispute. After Verres entered on his office, in accordance with his\n                edict, an edict such as Sacerdos had not issued, the daughter of the patron of\n                Sulpicius began to claim from Ligur a sixth part of the inheritance. Ligur was\n                absent. His brother  conducted his\n                cause; his friends and relations were present. That fellow Verres said that, unless\n                the business was settled with the woman, he should order her to take possession.\n                Lucius Gellius defended the cause of Ligur. He showed that his edict ought not to\n                prevail with respect to those inheritances which had accrued to the heirs before his\n                praetorship; that, if this edict had existed at that time, perhaps Ligur would not\n                have entered upon the inheritance at all. This just demand, and the highest\n                authority of influential men, was beaten down by money.  Ligur came to ; he\n                did not doubt that, if he himself had seen Verres, he should have been able to move\n                the man by the justice of his cause and by his own influence. He went to him to his\n                house; he explains the whole business; he points out to him how long ago it was that\n                the inheritance had come to him and, as it was easy for an able man to do in a most\n                just cause, he said many things which might have influenced any one. At last he\n                began to entreat him not to despise his influence and scorn his authority to such an\n                extent as to inflict such an injury upon him. The fellow began to accuse Ligur of\n                being so assiduous and so attentive in a business which was adventitious, and only\n                belonging to him by way of inheritance. He said that he ought to have a regard for\n                him also; that he required a great deal himself; that the dogs whom he kept about\n                him required a great deal. I cannot recount those things to you more plainly than\n                you have heard Ligur himself relate them in his evidence.  What are we to say, then, O Verres? Are we not to give credence\n                to even these men as witnesses? Are these things not material to the question before\n                us? Are we not to believe Marcus Octavius? Are we not to believe Lucius Ligur? Who\n                will believe us? Who shall we believe?

It is nothing less than the praetor of the city establishing this law\n                as long as he remains in office,that the praetor ought to be co-heir with\n                all those to whom an inheritance comes.

He died in the consulship of Lucius Sulla and\n                Quintus Metellus. He left behind him a young son under age. When Lucius Octavius and\n                Caius Aurelius the consuls had let out contracts for the holy temple, and were not\n                able to examine all the public buildings to see in what repair they were; nor could\n                the praetors to whom that business had been assigned, namely, Caius Sacerdos and\n                Marcus Caesius; a decree of the senate was passed that Caius Verres and Publius\n                Caelius, the praetors should examine into and decide about those public buildings as\n                to which no examination or decision had yet taken place. And after this power was\n                conferred on him, that man, as you have learnt from Caius Fannius and from Quintus\n                Tadius, as he had committed his robberies in every sort of affair without the least\n                disguise and with the greatest effrontery, wished to leave this as a most visible\n                record of his robberies, which we might, not occasionally hear of, but see every day\n                of our lives.  He inquired who was bound to\n                deliver up the temple of Castor in good repair. He knew that  himself was dead; he desired to know to whom\n                his property belonged. He hears that his son is under age. The fellow, who had been\n                in the habit of saying openly that boys and girls who were minors were the surest\n                prey for the praetors, said that the thing he had so long wished for had been\n                brought into his bosom. He thought that, in the care of a monument of such vast\n                size, of such laborious finish, however sound and in however thorough a state of\n                repair it might be, he should certainly find something to do, and some excuse for\n                plunder.  The temple of Castor ought to have been\n                entrusted to Lucius Rabonius. He by chance was the guardian of the young  by his father's will.

He ponders; he considers what he can do.\n                Some one of those dogs, of whom he himself had said to Ligur that there were a great\n                number about him, said to himYou, O Verres, have nothing which\n                you can do here, unless you like to try the pillars by a plumb-line. The\n                man, utterly ignorant of everything, asks what is the meaning of the expression,\n                by a plumb-line. They tell him that there is hardly any pillar\n                which is exactly perpendicular when tried by a plumb-line. By my\n                truth, says he, that is what we must do; let the pillars be\n                tested by a plumb-line.  Rabonius,\n                like a man who knew the law, in which law the number of the pillars only is set\n                down, but no mention made of a plumb-line, and who did not think it desirable for\n                himself to receive the temple on such terms, lest he should be hereafter expected to\n                hand it over under similar conditions, says that he is not to be treated in that\n                way, and that such an examination has no right to be made. Verres orders Rabonius to\n                be quiet, and at the same time holds out to him some hopes of a partnership with\n                himself in the business. He easily overpowers him, a moderate man, and not at all\n                obstinate in his opinions; and so he adheres to his determination of having the\n                pillars examined.  This unprecedented resolve,\n                and the unexpected calamity of the minor, is immediately reported to Caius Mustius,\n                the step-father of the youth, who is lately dead; to Marcus , his uncle, and to Publius Potitius, his\n                guardian, a most frugal man. They report the business to a man of the greatest\n                consideration, of the greatest benevolence and virtue, Marcus Marcellus, who was\n                also a guardian of the minor. Marcus Marcellus comes to Verres; he begs of him with\n                many arguments, in the name of his own good faith and diligence in his office, not\n                to endeavour to deprive  his ward of\n                his father's fortune by the greatest injustice. Verres, who had already in hope and\n                belief devoured that booty, was neither influenced by the justice of Marcus\n                Marcellus's argument, nor by his authority. And therefore he answered that he should\n                proceed with the examination, according to the orders which he had given.  As they found that or all applications to this man were\n                ineffectual, all access to him difficult, and almost impossible, being, as he was, a\n                man with whom neither right, nor equity, nor mercy, nor the arguments of a relation,\n                nor the wishes of a friend, nor the influence of any one had any weight, they\n                resolve that the best thing which they could do, as indeed might have occurred to\n                any one, was to beg Chelidon for her aid, who, while Verres was praetor, was not\n                only the real judge in all civil law, and in the disputes of all private\n                individuals, but who was supreme also in this affair of the repairs of the public\n                buildings."}, {"persName": {"surname": "Junius"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "138", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "53", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "Caius Mustius, a Roman knight, a farmer of the revenues, a man of the very highest\n                honour, came to Chelidon.

No one doubts that it is a much a better job to\n                make one new one.

Nor were the tears which were shed for him shed more by\n                the people than by us, and by yourself, O Hortensius, and by those who are to\n                pronounce sentence in this cause.

I will not say that which it is difficult\n                to prove; I will say thiswhich I will prove,that many men of\n                the first consequence heard you say that you ought to be pardoned for having\n                produced a false list, for that, unless you had guarded against it, you yourself\n                would also have been ruined by the same storm of unpopularity as that under which\n                Caius Junius fell.  In this way has that fellow\n                learnt to take care of himself and of his own safety, by entering both in his own\n                private registers and in the public documents what had never happened; by effacing\n                all mention of what had; and by continually taking away something, changing\n                something (taking care that no erasure was visible), interpolating something. For he\n                has come to such a pitch, that he cannot even find a defence for his crimes without\n                committing other grimes. That most senseless man thought that such a substitution of\n                his own judges also could be effected by the instrumentality of his comrade, Quintus\n                Curtius, who was to be principal judge; and unless I had prevented that by the power\n                of the people, and the outcries and reproaches of all men, the advantage of having\n                judges taken from this decuria  of our body, whose influence it was desirable for me\n                should be rendered as extensive an possible, while he was substituting others for\n                them without any reason, and placing on the bench those whom Verres had approved."}]}, {"@type": "Book", "@n": "2", "head": ["THE SECOND BOOK OF THE SECOND PLEADING AGAINST CAIUS VERRES.", "CONCERNING HIS MANNER OF DECIDING CAUSES AS JUDGE WHILE IN SICILY."], "argument": {"head": "The Argument.", "p": {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, "#text": "Cicero divides his accusation of Verres, on account of his conduct in , under four heads, of which the first is\n                  judicial corruption and extortion.

She was the first to be\n                called a province; and the provinces are a great ornament to the empire. She was the\n                first who taught our ancestors how glorious a thing it was to rule over foreign\n                nations. She alone has displayed such good faith and such good will towards the\n                Roman people, that the states of that island which have once come into our alliance\n                have never revolted afterwards, but many of them, and those the most illustrious of\n                them, have remained firm to our friendship for ever.

How great are these services, O judges, which perhaps we are\n                hardly aware we are receiving,that we have many wealthy citizens, that\n                they have a province with which they are connected, faithful and productive to which\n                they may easily make excursions, where they may be welcome to engage in traffic;\n                citizens, some of whom she dismisses with gain and profit by supplying them with\n                merchandise, some she retains, as they take a fancy to turn farmers, or graziers, or\n                traders in her land, or even to pitch in it their habitations and their homes. And\n                this is no trifling advantage to the Roman people, that so vast a number of Roman\n                citizens should be detained so near home by such a respectable and profitable\n                business.  And since our tributary nations and our\n                provinces are, as it were, farms belonging to the Roman people; just as one is most\n                pleased with those farms which are nearest to one, so too the suburban character of\n                this province is very acceptable to the Roman people. And as to the inhabitants\n                themselves, O judges, such is their patience their virtue, and their frugality, that\n                they appear to come very nearly up to the old-fashioned manners of our country, and\n                not to those which now prevail. There is nothing then like the rest of the Greeks;\n                no sloth, no luxury; on the contrary there is the greatest diligence in all public\n                and private affairs, the greatest economy, and the greatest vigilance. Moreover,\n                they are so fond of our nation that they are the only people where neither a\n                publican nor a money-changer is unpopular.  And\n                they have born the injuries of many of our magistrates with such a disposition, that\n                they have never till this time fled by any public resolution to the altar of our\n                laws and to your protection; although they endured the misery of that year which so\n                prostrated them that they could not have been preserved through it, if Caius\n                Marcellus had not come among them, by some special providence, as it were, in order\n                that the safety of  might be twice\n                secured by the same family.

Verres set up the accusers; Verres summoned the brother to appear before him;\n                Verres heard the cause; Verres gave sentence. A vast sum was paid; they who paid it\n                gained the cause; and you argue in defence that money was not paid to\n                Verres. I can help you; my witnesses too say the same thing; they say\n                they paid it to Volcatius.

Those chosen companions of yours were your hands; the prefects, the secretaries,\n                the surgeons, the attendants the soothsayers, the criers, were your hands. The more\n                each individual was connected with you by any relationship, or affinity, or\n                intimacy, the more he was considered one of your bands. The whole of that retinue of\n                yours, which caused more evil to \n                than a hundred troops of fugitive slaves would have caused, was beyond all question\n                your hand. Whatever was taken by any one of these men, that must be considered not\n                only as having been given to you, but as having been paid into your own hand. For if\n                you, O judges, admit this defence, He did not receive it\n                himself, you will put an end to all judicial proceedings for extortion.\n                For no criminal will be brought before you so guilty as not to be able to avail\n                himself of that plea?

If a Roman\n                citizen makes a claim on a Sicilian, a Sicilian judge is assigned; if a Sicilian\n                makes a claim on a Roman citizen, a Roman citizen is assigned as judge: in all other\n                matters judges are appointed selected from the body of Roman citizens dwelling in\n                the place. In law-suits between the farmers and the tax collectors, trials are\n                regulated by the law about corn, which they call .  All these rights were not\n                only thrown into disorder while that man was praetor, but indeed were openly taken\n                away from both the Sicilians and from the Roman citizens. First of all, their own\n                laws with reference to one another were disregarded. If a citizen had a dispute with\n                another citizen, he either assigned any one as judge whom it was convenient to\n                himself to assign, crier, soothsayer, or his own physician; or if a tribunal was\n                established by the laws, and the parties had come before one of their\n                fellow-citizens as the judge, that citizen was not allowed to decide without\n                control. For, listen to the edict issued by this man, by which edict he brought\n                every tribunal under his own authority: If any one had given a wrong\n                decision, he would examine into the matter himself; when he had examined, he would\n                punish. And when he did that, no one doubted that when the judge thought\n                that some one else was doing to sit in judgment on his decision, and that he should\n                be at the risk of his life in the matter, he would consider the inclination of the\n                man who he expected would presently be judging in a matter affecting his down\n                existence as a citizen.  Judges selected from the\n                Roman settlers there were none; none even of the traders in the cities were proposed\n                as judges. The crowd of judges which I am speaking of was the retinue, not of\n                Quintus Scaevola, (who, however, did not make practice of appointing judges from\n                among his own followers,) but of Caius Verres. And what sort of a retinue do you\n                suppose it was when such a man as he was its chief? You see announced in the edict,\n                If the senate gives an erroneous decision.... I will prove\n                that, if at any time a bench of judges was taken from the senate, that also gave its\n                decisions, through compulsion, on his part, contrary to their own opinions. There\n                never was any selection of the judges by lot, according to the Rupilian law, except\n                when he had no interest whatever in the case. The tribunals established in the case\n                of many disputes by the  were all\n                abolished by a single edict; no judges were appointed selected from the settlers or\n                from the traders.

An inheritance of at least three millions of  came to him by the will of his relation Heraclius;\n                the house was full of silver plate exquisitely carved, of abundance of embroidered\n                robes, and of most valuable slaves; things in which who is ignorant of the insane\n                cupidity of that man? The fact was a subject of common conversation, that a great\n                fortune had come to Heraclius that Heraclius would not only be rich, but that he\n                would be amply supplied with furniture, plate, robes and slaves.  Verres, too, hears this; and at first he tries by the tricks and\n                maneuvers which he is so fond of, to get him to lend things to him to look at, which\n                he means never to return. Afterwards he takes counsel from some Syracusans; and they\n                were relations of his, whose wives too were not believed to be entirely strangers to\n                him, by name Cleomenes and Aeschrio. What influence they had with him, and on what\n                disgraceful reasons it was founded, you may understand from the rest of the\n                accusation.

The\n                idea pleased Verres.  For he foresaw that, when\n                such an inheritance became disputed, and was claimed by process of law, it was quite\n                impossible for him not to get some plunder out of it before it was done with.

The province did not corrupt that man, as it has corrupted some;\n                he was the same man that he had been at . When Heraclius said, what all men well knew, that there was an\n                established form of law among the Sicilians by which causes between them were to be\n                tried; that there was the Rupilian law, which Publius Rupilius, the consul, had\n                enacted, with the advice of ten chosen commissioners; that every praetor and consul\n                in  had always observed this law.

Accordingly he flies from  that night. Verres the next day, early in the\n                morning,for he had got up much earlier than he ever did\n                before,orders the judges to be summoned. When he finds that Heraclius\n                does not appear, he begins to insist on their condemning Heraclius in his absence.\n                They expostulate with him, and beg him, if he pleases, to adhere to the rule he had\n                himself laid down, and not to compel them to decide against the absent party in\n                favour of the party who was present, before the tenth hour. He agrees.  In the meantime both Verres himself began to be uneasy,\n                and his friends and counselors began also to be a good deal vexed at Heraclius'\n                having fled. They thought that the condemnation of an absent man, especially in a\n                matter involving so large a sum of money, would be a far more odious measure than if\n                he had appeared in court, and had there been condemned. To this consideration was\n                added the fact, that because the judges had not been appointed in accordance with\n                the provisions of the Rupilian law, they saw that the affair would appear much more\n                base and more iniquitous. And so, while he endeavours to correct this error, his\n                covetousness and dishonesty are made more evident.

That which Heraclius the day before could not obtain from him, though\n                he begged and entreated it of him with many tears, occurred to him the next day of\n                his own accord, and he recollected that he ought to appoint judges according to the\n                Rupilian law. He draws the names of three out of the urn: he commands them to\n                condemn Heraclius in his absence. So they condemn him.  What was the meaning of that madness? Did you think that you\n                would never have to give an account of your actions? Did you think that such men as\n                these would never hear of these transactions? Is such an inheritance to be claimed\n                without the slightest grounds for such a claim, in order to become the plunder of\n                the praetor? is the name of the city to be introduced? is the base character of a\n                false accuser to be fixed upon an honourable state? And not this only, but is the\n                whole business to be conducted in such a matter that there is to be not even the\n                least appearance of justice kept up? For, in the name of the immortal gods, what\n                difference does it make whether the praetor commands and by force compels any one to\n                abandon all his property, or passed a sentence by which, without any trial, he must\n                lose all his fortune?"}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "45", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "46", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "19", "@unit": "chapter"}], "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, "#text": "In truth you cannot deny that you ought to have appointed judges according to the\n                provisions of the Rupilian law, especially when Heraclius demanded it.

You know the appearance of the man, you know his\n                audacity; yet at that moment he was much disquieted by the reports circulated among\n                the people, by their outcry, and by the impossibility of concealing the robbery of\n                so large a sum of money. When he came to himself, he summoned the Syracusans to him,\n                because he could not deny that money had been given him by them; he did not go to a\n                distance to look for some one, (in which case he would not have been able to prove\n                it,) but he took one of his nearest relations, a sort of second son,  and accused him of\n                having stolen the money. He declared that he would make him refund it; and he, after\n                he heard that, had a proper regard for his dignity, for his age, and for his noble\n                birth. He addressed the senate on the subject; he declared to them that he had\n                nothing to do with the business Of Verres he said what all saw to be true, and he\n                said it plainly enough.

There is a town called Bidis, an insignificant one\n                indeed, not far from . By far\n                the first man of that city is a man of the name of Epicrates. An inheritance of five\n                hundred thousand  had come to him from some\n                woman who was a relation of his, and so near a relation, that even if she had died\n                intestate, Epicrates must have been her heir according to the laws of Bidis. The\n                transaction at  which I have\n                just mentioned was fresh in men's memories,the affair I mean of Heraclius\n                the Syracusan, who would not have lost his property if an inheritance had not come\n                to him. To this Epicrates too an inheritance had come, as I have said.  His enemies began to consider that he too might be easily\n                turned out of his property by the same praetor as Heraclius had been stripped of his\n                by; they plan the affair secretly; they suggest it to Verres by his emissaries. The\n                cause is arranged, so that the people belonging to the palaestra at Bidis are to\n                claim his inheritance from Epicrates, just as the men of the Syracusan palaestra had\n                claimed his from Heraclius. You never saw a praetor so devoted to the interests of\n                the palaestra. But he defended the men of the palaestra in such a way that he\n                himself came off with his wheels all the better greased. In this instance Verres, as\n                soon as he foresaw what would happen, ordered eighty thousand  to be paid to one of his friends.  The matter could not be kept entirely secret. Epicrates is\n                informed of it by one of those who were concerned in it. At first he began to\n                disregard and despise it, because the claim made against him had actually nothing in\n                it about which a doubt could be raised. Afterwards when he thought of Heraclius, and\n                recollected the licentiousness of Verres, he thought it better to depart secretly\n                from the province.

The\n                men go to ; they go to Epicrates;\n                they point out to him, what indeed he knew, that they had paid eighty thousand\n                  ; they beg him to make up to them the money\n                they themselves were out of pocket; they tell him he may take any security from them\n                that he likes, that none of them will go to law with Epicrates about that\n                inheritance.  Epicrates reproaches the men at\n                great length and with great severity, and dismisses them.

He says he\n                wants to examine into that affair of the eighty thousand . He summons many people before him.

Volcatius with great\n                equanimity brings the money, like a man who was sure to lose nothing by it; he\n                returns it to them in the sight of many people; the men of Bidis carry the money\n                away.  Some one will say, What fault\n                then do you find with Verres in this, who not only is not a thief himself, but who\n                did not even allow any one else to be one? Listen a moment. Now you shall\n                see that this money which was just now seen to leave his house by the main road\n                returned back again by a by-path. What came next? Ought not the praetor, having\n                inquired into the case with the bench of judges, when he had found out that a\n                companion of his own, with the object of corruptly swaying the law, the sentence,\n                and the bench, (a matter in which the reputation of the praetor and even his\n                condition as a free citizen were at stake,) had received money, and that the men of\n                Bidis had given it, doing injury to the fair fame and fortune of the\n                praetor,ought he not, I say, to have punished both him who had taken the\n                money, and those who had given it? You who had determined to punish those who had\n                given an erroneous decision, which is often done out of ignorance, do you permit men\n                to escape with impunity who thought that money might be received or be paid for the\n                purpose of influencing your decree, your judicial decision?

For he showed that if any one made a demand of any thing from an absent\n                person, he would hear the cause, though without any precedent for so doing. The men\n                of Bidis appearthey claim the inheritance.

The adversaries did not dare to\n                say anything against this; no escape from it could be devised. They accuse the man\n                of having fled for the purpose of cheating them.

A man of the name of Letilius had come\n                to him two days before, a man not unversed in literature, so he constantly used him\n                as his secretary. He had brought him many letters, and, among them, one from home\n                which had changed the whole man. On a sudden he began to say that he wished to do\n                everything to please Verres; that he was connected with him by the ties of both\n                friendship and relationship. All men wondered that this should now at last have\n                occurred to him, after he had injured him by so many actions and so many decisions.\n                Some thought that Letilius had come as an ambassador from Verres, to put him in mind\n                of their mutual interests, their friendship, and their relationship. From that time\n                he began to solicit the cities for testimony in favour of Verres, and not only to\n                try to deter the witnesses against him by threats, but even to detain them by force.\n                And if I had not by my arrival checked his endeavours in some degree, and striven\n                among the Sicilians, by the help of Glabrio's letters and of the law, I should not\n                have been able to bring so many witnesses into this court."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}, {"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003897", "#text": "Messana"}], "#text": "But, as I began to say, remark the miseries of the Sicilians.

Out of many, which are all nearly alike, I will\n                select those which seem to go beyond all the others in rascality. There was a man of\n                Halicya, named Sopater, among the first men of his state for riches and high\n                character. He, having been accused by his enemies before Caius Sacerdos the praetor,\n                on a capital charge, was easily acquitted. The same enemies again accused this same\n                Sopater on the same charge before Caius Verres when he had come as successor to\n                Sacerdos. The matter appeared trifling to Sopater, both because he was innocent, and\n                because he thought that Verres would never dare to overturn the decision of\n                Sacerdos. The defendant is cited to appear. The cause is heard at . Those changes are brought forward by\n                the accusers which had been already previously extinguished, not only by the\n                defence, but also by the decision.  Quintus\n                Minucius, a Roman knight, among the first for a high and honourable reputation, and\n                not unknown to you, O judges, defended the cause of Sopater. There was nothing in\n                the cause which seemed possible to be feared, or even to be doubted about at all. In\n                the meantime that same Timarchides, that fellow's attendant and freedman, who is, as\n                you have learnt by many witnesses at the former hearing, his agent and manager in\n                all affairs of this sort, comes to Sopater, and advised him not to trust too much to\n                the decision of Sacerdos and the justice of his cause; he tells him that his\n                accusers and enemies have thoughts of giving money to the praetor, but that the\n                praetor would rather take it to acquit; and at the same time, that he had rather, if\n                it were possible, not rescind a decision of his predecessor. Sopater, as this\n                happened to him quite suddenly and unexpectedly, was greatly perplexed, and had no\n                answer ready to make to Timarchides, except that he would consider what he had best\n                do in such a case; and at the same time he told him that he was in great\n                difficulties respecting money matters. Afterwards he consulted with his friends; and\n                as they advised him to purchase an acquittal, he came to Timarchides. Having\n                explained his difficulties to him, he brings the man down to eighty thousand\n                  , and pays him that money."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "71", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "72", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "73", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "30", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "When the cause came to be heard, all who were defending Sopater were without any\n                fear or any anxiety. No crime had been committed; the matter had been decided;\n                Verres had received the money. Who could doubt how it would turn out? The matter is\n                not summed up that day; the court breaks up; Timarchides comes a second time to\n                Sopater. He says that his accusers were promising a much larger sum to the praetor\n                than what he had given, and that if he were wise he would consider what he had best\n                do. The man, though he was a Sicilian, and a defendantthat is to say,\n                though he had little chance of obtaining justiceand was in an unfortunate\n                position, still would not bear with or listen to Timarchides any longer. Do, said\n                he, whatever you please; I will not give any more And this, too, was the advice of\n                his friends and defenders; and so much the more, because Verres, however he might\n                conduct himself on the trial, still had with him on the bench some honourable men of\n                the Syracusan community, who had also been on the bench with Sacerdos when this same\n                Sopater had been acquitted. They considered that it was absolutely impossible for\n                the same men, who had formerly acquitted Sopater, to condemn him now on the same\n                charge, supported by the same witnesses. And so with this one hope they came before\n                the court.  And when they came thither, when the\n                same men came in numbers on the bench who were used to sit there, and when the whole\n                defence of Sopater rested on this hope, namely, on the number and dignity of the\n                bench of judges, and on the fact of their being, as I have said before, the same men\n                who had before acquitted Sopater of the same charge, mark the open rascality and\n                audacity of the man, not attempted to be disguised, I will not say under any reason,\n                but with even the least dissimulation. He orders Marcus Petilius, a Roman knight,\n                whom he had with him on the bench, to attend to a private cause in which he was\n                judge. Petilius refused, because Verres himself was detaining his friends whom he\n                had wished to have with him on the bench. He, liberal man, said that he did not wish\n                to detain any of the men who preferred being with Petilius. And so they all go; for\n                the rest also prevail upon him not to detain them, saying that they wished to appear\n                in favour of one or other of the parties who were concerned in that trial. And so he\n                is left alone with his most worthless retinue. \n                Minucius, who was defending Sopater, did not doubt that Verres, since he had\n                dismissed the whole bench, would not proceed with the investigation of his cause\n                that day; when all of a sudden he is ordered to state his case. He answers,\n                To whom? To me, says Verres,\n                if I appear to you of sufficient dignity to try the cause of a Sicilian,\n                a Greek. Certainly, says he, you are of\n                sufficient dignity, but I wish for the presence of those men who were present\n                before, and were acquainted with the case. State your\n                case, says he; they cannot be present.\n                For in truth, says Quintus Minucius, Petilius\n                begged me also to be with him on the bench; and at the same time he began\n                to leave his seat as counsel.  Verres, in a rage,\n                attacks him with pretty violent language, and even began to threaten him severely,\n                for bringing such a charge, and trying to excite such odium against him."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "74", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "75", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "31", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "76", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Minucius, who lived as a merchant at , in such a way as always to bear in mind his rights and his\n                dignity and who knew that it became him not to increase his property in the province\n                at the expense of any portion of his liberty, gave the man such answer as seemed\n                good to him, and as the occasion and the cause required. He said that he would not\n                speak in defence of his client when the bench of judges was sent away and dismissed.\n                And so he left the bar. And all the other friends and advocates of Sopater, except\n                the Sicilians, did the same.  Verres, though he is\n                a man of incredible effrontery and audacity, yet when he was thus suddenly left\n                alone got frightened and agitated.

So he was quite in a fever with\n                perplexity. He turned himself every way, not only as to his mind, but also as to his\n                body; so that all who were present could plainly see that fear and covetousness were\n                contending together in his heart.

Sopater began to implore him by the good faith of gods and\n                man, to hear the cause in company with the rest of the bench. He orders the\n                witnesses to be summoned instantly. One or two of them give their evidence briefly.\n                No questions are asked.

All the Sicilians will say the same; all the citizens\n                of Halicya will say the same; even the young son of Sopater will say the same, who\n                by that most cruel man has been deprived of his innocent father and of his father's\n                property.  But if I cannot make the case plain, as\n                far as the money is concerned, by evidence, can you deny this, or will you now deny,\n                that after you had dismissed the rest of the judges, after those excellent men who\n                had sat on the bench with Caius Sacerdos, and who were used to sit there with you,\n                had been got rid of, you by yourself decided a matter which had been decided\n                before?that the man, whom Caius Sacerdos, assisted by a bench of\n                colleagues, after an investigation of the case, acquitted, you, without any bench of\n                colleagues, without investigating the case, condemned? When you have confessed this,\n                which was done openly in the forum at , before the eyes of the whole province; then deny, if you\n                like, that you received money. You will be very likely to find a man, when he sees\n                these things which were done openly, to ask what you did secretly; or to doubt\n                whether he had better believe my witnesses or your defenders.  I have already said, O judges, that I shall not enumerate all\n                that fellow's actions which are of this sort; but that I shall select those which\n                are the most remarkable."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "83", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "84", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "85", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "35", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "86", "@unit": "section"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Delos", "#text": "Delos"}, {"@key": "perseus,Corinth", "#text": "Corinth"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000004", "#text": "Asia"}], "#text": "Listen now to another remarkable exploit of his, one that has already been\n                mentioned in many places, and one of such a sort that every possible crime seems to\n                be comprehended in that one.

Sthenius, the man who is sitting by us,\n                is a citizen of Thermae, long since known to many by his eminent virtue and his\n                illustrious birth, and now known to all men by his own misfortune and the unexampled\n                injuries he has received from that man. Verres having often enjoyed his hospitality,\n                and having not only stayed often with him at Thermae, but having almost dwelt with\n                him there, took away from him out of his house everything which could in any\n                uncommon degree delight the mind or eyes of any one. In truth, Sthenius from his\n                youth had collected such things as these with more than ordinary diligence; elegant\n                furniture of brass, made at  and at\n                  , paintings, and even a good\n                deal of elegantly wrought silver, as far as the wealth of a citizen of Thermae could\n                afford. And these things, when he was in  as a young man, he had collected diligently, as I said, not so\n                much for any pleasure to himself, as for ornaments against the visits of Roman\n                citizens, his own friends and connections, whenever he invited them.  But after Verres got them all, some by begging for then,\n                some by demanding them, and some by boldly taking them, Sthenius bore it as well as\n                he could, but he was affected with unavoidable indignation in his mind, at that\n                fellow having rendered his house, which had been so beautifully furnished and\n                decorated, naked and empty; still he told his indignation to no one. He thought he\n                must bear the injuries of the praetor in silencethose of his guest with\n                calmness.  Meantime that man, with that\n                covetousness of his which was now notorious and the common talk of every one, as he\n                took a violent fancy to some exceedingly beautiful and very ancient statues at\n                Thermae placed in the public place, began to beg of Sthenius to promise him his\n                countenance and to aid him in taking them away. But Sthenius not only refused, but\n                declared to him that it was utterly impossible that most ancient statues, memorials\n                of Publius Africanus, should ever be taken away out of the town of the Thermitani,\n                as long as that city and the empire of the Roman people remained uninjured."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Carthage", "#text": "Carthage"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000074", "#text": "Greece"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "87", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "36", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "88", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Indeed, (that you may learn at the same time both the humanity and the justice of\n                Publius Africanus,) the Carthaginians had formerly taken the town of Himera, one of\n                the first towns in  for renown and\n                for beauty. Scipio as he thought it a thing worthy of the Roman people, that, after\n                the war was over, our allies should recover their property in consequence of our\n                victory, took care, after  had\n                been taken, that everything which he could manage should be restored to all the\n                Sicilians. As Himera had been destroyed, those citizens whom the disasters of the\n                war had spared had settled at Thermae, on the border of the same district, and not\n                far from their ancient town. They thought that they were recovering the fortune and\n                dignity of their fathers, when those ornaments of their ancestors were being placed\n                in the town of Thermae.  There were many statues\n                of brass; among them a statue of Himera herself, of marvellous beauty, made in the\n                shape and dress of a woman, after the name of the town and of the river. There was\n                also a statue of the poet Stesichorus, aged, stooping,made, as men think,\n                with the most exceeding skill,who was, indeed, a citizen of Himera, but\n                who both was and is in the highest renown and estimation over all  for his genius.

He said that it was more honourable for the men of Thermae to\n                abandon their city than to allow the memorials of their ancestors, the spoils of\n                their enemies, the gifts of a most illustrious man, the proofs of the alliance and\n                friendship with the Roman people, to be taken away out of their city. The minds of\n                all were moved. No one was found who did not agree that it was better to die. And so\n                Verres found this town almost the only one in the whole world from which he could\n                not carry off anything of that sort belonging to the community, either by violence,\n                or by stealth, or by his own absolute power, or by his interest, or by bribery. But,\n                however, all this covetousness of his I will expose another time; at present I must\n                return to Sthenius.  Verres being furiously\n                enraged against Sthenius, renounces the connection of hospitality with him, leaves\n                his house, and departs;  for, indeed,\n                he had moved his quarters before.

So he preferred migrating to the son-in-law of\n                Agathinus. Only one night elapsed before he became so intimate with Dorotheus, that,\n                as one might say, they had everything in common. He paid as great attention to\n                Agathinus as if he had been some connection or relation of his own.

And immediately he began to\n                instigate Agathinus, his new relation and host, to apply himself to such a cause,\n                and to accuse him. But he said loudly, in the hearing of every one, that he would\n                not do so, and that he was not so far an enemy to Sthenius as to say that he was\n                implicated in any capital crime.

Verres immediately issues an edict that Sthenius is to appear at  on the first of December.  He, when he had reached , and had a sufficiently prosperous voyage for so unfavourable a\n                time of year, and had found everything more just and gentle than the disposition of\n                the praetor, his own guest, related the whole matter to his friends, and it appeared\n                to them all cruel and scandalous, as indeed it was."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "96", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "97", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "40", "@unit": "chapter"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}], "#text": "Therefore Cnaeus Lentulus and Lucius Gellius the consuls immediately propose in the\n                senate that it be established as a law, if it so seem good to the conscript fathers,\n                That men be not proceeded against on capital charges in the provinces\n                while they are absent.

On that day nothing could be\n                done, because it was so late, and because his father had found men to waste the time\n                in speaking.

For\n                that place and rank was thought to be so decidedly due to him for that year, that\n                even Climachias could say nothing against him. The matter is referred to Verres, and\n                is decided according to his usual fashion. Some beautiful and valuable specimens of\n                carving are removed from Artemo's.

It is a custom of the Sicilians, and of\n                the rest of the Greeks, because they wish their days and months to agree with the\n                calculations as to the sun and moon, if there be any difference sometimes to take\n                out a day, or, at most, two days from a month, which they call . And so also they sometimes make a month longer by a day\n                or by two days. And when he heard of that, he, this new astronomer, who was thinking\n                not so much of the heavens as of the heavy plate,  he orders\n                (not a day to be taken out of the month, but) a month and a half to be taken out of\n                the year; so that the day which, as one may say, ought to have been the thirteenth\n                of January, became the first of March. And that is done in spite of the\n                remonstrances and indignation of every one. That was the legitimate day for holding\n                the comitia. On that day Climachias is declared to have been elected priest.\n                   When Herodotus returns from , fifteen days, as he supposed, before the\n                comitia, he comes on the month of the comitia, when the comitia have been held\n                thirty days before. Then the people of Cephalaedium voted an intercalary month of\n                forty-five days, in order that the rest of the months might fall again into their\n                proper season. If these things could be done at , no doubt he would somehow or other have contrived to have the\n                forty-five days between the two sets of games taken away, during which days alone\n                this trial could take place."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "132", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "133", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "54", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "134", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "But now it is worth while to see how the censors were appointed in  while that man was praetor.

When the praetor announced so vast a scene of bargaining\n                and trafficking as that, people came to  to see him, from all quarters. The whole of the praetor's\n                house was on fire with the eagerness and cupidity of men; and no wonder, when all\n                the comitia of so many cities were packed together into one house, and when all the\n                ambition of an entire province was confined in one chamber. Bribes being openly\n                asked for, and biddings being openly made, Timarchides appointed two censors for\n                every city. He, by his own labour, and by his own visits to every one, by all the\n                trouble which he took in this employment, achieved this, that all the money came to\n                Verres without his having any anxiety on his part. How much money this Timarchides\n                made, you cannot as yet know; for a certainty; but in what a variety of manners, and\n                how shamefully, he plundered people, you heard at the former pleading, by the\n                evidence of many witnesses."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "135", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "136", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "55", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "137", "@unit": "section"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, "#text": "Athenio was a Cilician slave who had headed a revolt of\n                  slaves in , A.U.C. 650.

In the seduction of\n                women, and in all licentiousness and wickedness of that character, I found this\n                Timarchides wonderfully fitted by nature to be subservient to his infamous lusts,\n                and unexampled profligacy. In finding out who people were, in calling on them, in\n                addressing them, in bribing them, in doing anything in matters of that sort, however\n                cunningly, however audaciously, however shamelessly it might be necessary to go to\n                work, I heard that this man could contrive admirable schemes for ensuring success.\n                For, as for Verres himself, he was only a man of a covetousness ever open-mouthed,\n                and ever threatening, but he had no ingenuity, no resources; so that, in whatever he\n                did of his own accord, (just as you know was the case with him at ,) he seemed to rob openly rather than to\n                cheat.  But the other fellow's skill and artifice\n                were marvellous, so that he could hunt out and scent out with the greatest\n                acuteness, all over the province, whatever had happened to any one, whatever any one\n                stood in need of. He was able to find out, to converse with, to tamper with every\n                one's foes, and every one's enemies; to know the circumstances of every trial on\n                both sides; to ascertain men's inclinations, and power, and resources; where it was\n                necessary to strike terror; where it was desirable to hold out hope. Every accuser,\n                every informer, he had in his power, if he wished to cause trouble to any one, he\n                did it without any difficulty. All Verres's decrees, and commands, and letters, he\n                sold in the most skillful and cunning manner. \n                And he was not only the minister of Verres's pleasures, he also took equally good\n                care of himself. He not only picked up whatever money had slipped through his\n                principal's fingers, by which he amassed great riches, but he also picked up the\n                relics of his pleasures and of his profligacy. Therefore do not fancy that Athenio\n                   reigned in\n                  , for he took no city; but know ye\n                that the runaway slave Timarchides reigned in every city of  for three years; that the children, the\n                matrons, the property, and all the fortunes of the most ancient and most devoted\n                allies of the Roman people were all that time in the power of Timarchides. He\n                therefore, as I say, he, Timarchides, sent censors into every city, having taken\n                bribes for their appointment.

Why, it is either cities in their capacity\n                of communities, that confer these honours, or men according to their classes, as\n                cultivators, as merchants, as shipowners.

Every\n                one, in short, shall be made aware of this fact in this cause,that the\n                feelings of the Sicilians are such, that if that man be not punished, they think\n                that they must leave their habitations and their homes and depart from , and flee to some distant land.

What\n                man ever lived of whom such a thing was heard as has happened to you, that his\n                statues in his province, erected in the public places, and some of them even in the\n                holy temples, were thrown down by force by the whole population?

It is an unexampled thing, O judges, a sort of\n                prodigy amazing the Sicilians, and among all the Greeks. I would not have believed\n                that story about the statues, if I had not seen them myself uprooted and lying on\n                the ground; because it is a custom among all the Greeks to think that honours paid\n                to men by monuments of that sort, are, to some extent, consecrated, and under the\n                protection of the gods.  Therefore, when the\n                Rhodians, almost single-handed, carried on the first war against Mithridates, and\n                withstood all his power and his most vigorous attacks on their walls, and shores,\n                and fleets,when they, beyond all other nations, were enemies to the king;\n                still, even then, at the time of imminent danger to their city, they did not touch\n                his statue which was among them in the most frequented place in their city. Perhaps\n                there might seem some inconsistency in preserving the effigy and image of the man,\n                when they were striving to overthrow the man himself: but still I saw, when I was\n                among them, that they had a religious feeling in those matters handed down to them\n                from their ancestors, and that they argued in this way;that as to the\n                statue, they regarded the period when it had been erected; but as to the man, they\n                regarded the fact of his waging war against them, and being an enemy."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "160", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "161", "@unit": "section"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Tauromenium", "#text": "Tauromenium"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "foederatae civitates"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "foedus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "civitas"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,7007512", "#text": "Gades"}, {"@key": "tgn,7008559", "#text": "Saguntum"}, {"@key": "tgn,7008781", "#text": "Massilia"}, {"@key": "perseus,Tauromenium", "#text": "Tauromenium"}], "#text": "The  were\n                  those states which were connected with  by a treaty, .

He, while he was attending the praetor about all the markets, and\n                never leaving him, had got into such familiarity with, and aptitude at the practice\n                of selling Verres's decrees and decisions, and managing his other concerns, that he\n                was considered almost a second Timarchides.  He\n                was in one respect still more important; because he also lent money at usury to\n                those who were purchasing anything of the praetor. And this usury, O judges, was\n                such that even the profit from the other transactions was inferior to the gain\n                obtained by it.

But Canuleius, who had an agency at , in the harbour, had also written\n                accounts to his shareholders of many of Verres's robberies, giving instances,\n                especially, concerning things which had been exported from  without paying the harbour dues. But\n                the same company was farming both the harbour dues and the taxes on pasture land.\n                And thus it happened that there were many things which we could state and produce\n                against Verres from the letters of that company. \n                But it happened that Carpinatius, who had by this time become connected with him by\n                the greatest intimacy, and also by community of interests, afterwards sent frequent\n                letters to his partners, speaking of his exceeding kindness, and of his services to\n                their common property. And in truth, as he was used to do and to decree everything\n                which Carpinatius requested him, Carpinatius also began to write still more flaming\n                accounts to his shareholders, in order, if possible, utterly to efface the\n                recollection of all that he had written before.

And the shareholders did so, according to the old custom of farmers; not\n                because they thought him deserving of any honour, but because they thought it was\n                for their own interest to be thought to remember kindness, and to be grateful for\n                it. They expressed their thanks to him, and said that Carpinatius had often sent\n                letters to them mentioning his good offices."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "174", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "175", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "72", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "176", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "When he had made answer that he had done those things gladly, and had greatly\n                extolled the services of Carpinatius, he charges a friend of his, who at that time\n                was the chief collector of that company, to take care diligently, and to make sure\n                that there was nothing in any of the letters of any of the partners which could tell\n                against his safety and reputation.

I found only two small\n                books, which had been sent by Lucius Canuleius to the shareholders from the harbour\n                at ; in which there was\n                entered an account of many months, and of things exported in Verres's name without\n                having paid harbour dues. These I sealed up immediately.  These were documents of that sort which of all the papers of the\n                company I was most anxious to find; but still I only found enough, O judges, to\n                produce to you as a sample, as it were. But still, whatever is in these books,\n                however unimportant it may seem to be, will at all events be undeniable; and by this\n                you will be able to form your conjectures as to the rest. Read for me, I beg, this\n                first book, and then the other.

However, he will be more favourable to the cultivators than he\n                appears; for the same man who has announced in his edict that he will allow a trial\n                against the collectors, in which they shall be liable to an eightfold penalty, had\n                it also set down in his edict, that he would grant a similar trial against the\n                cultivators, in which they should be liable to a fourfold penalty. Who now dares to\n                say that this man was unfavourably disposed or hostile to the cultivators? How much\n                more lenient is he to them than to the collectors?

In the first place, what dispute can there be when he who\n                ought to make a claim, makes a seizure instead? and when he seizes, not as much as\n                is due, but as much as he chooses? and when he, whose property is seized, cannot\n                possibly recover his own by a suit at law?

When Quintus Septitius, a most honourable man, and a Roman knight,\n                resisted Apronius, and declared that he would not pay more than a tenth, a sudden\n                special edict makes its appearance, that no one is to remove his corn from the\n                threshing-floor before he has settled the demands of the collector. Septitius put up\n                with this injustice also, and allowed his corn to be damaged by the rain, while\n                remaining on the threshing-floor, when on a sudden that most fruitful and profitable\n                edict comes out, that every one was to have his tenths delivered at the water-side\n                before the first of August.  By this edict, it was\n                not the Sicilians, (for he had already sufficiently crushed and ruined them by his\n                previous edicts,) but all those Roman knights who had fancied that they could\n                preserve their rights against Apronius, excellent men, and highly esteemed by other\n                praetors, who were delivered bound hand and foot into the power of Apronius. For\n                just listen and see what sort of edicts these are. A man, says\n                he, is not to remove his corn from the threshing-floor, unless he has\n                settled all demands. This is a sufficiently strong inducement to making\n                unfair demands; for I had rather give too much, than not remove my corn from the\n                threshing-floor at the proper time. But that violence does not affect Septitius, and\n                some others like Septitius, who say, I will rather not remove my corn,\n                than submit to an extortionate demand. To these then the second edict is\n                opposed. You must have delivered it by the first of August. I\n                will deliver it then.Unless you have settled the demands, you\n                shall not remove it. So the fixing of the day for delivering it at the\n                waterside, compelled the man to remove his corn from the threshing floor. And the\n                prohibition to remove, unless the demand were settled, made the settlement\n                compulsory and not voluntary."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003850", "#text": "Lilybaeum"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "39", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "16", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "40", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "But what follows is not only contrary to the law of Hiero, not only contrary to the\n                customs of all former praetors, but even contrary to all the rights of the\n                Sicilians, which they have as granted them by the senate and people of ,that they shall not be forced to\n                give security to appear in any courts of justice but their own.

Although that\n                device for false accusation was also contrived with singular cunning, when he\n                ordered that the cultivators should make a return of their acres, as to what they\n                were sown with.

You sold the tenths at a high price.

I say that there is not one of you\n                who has not often heard that the collectors of the tenths were that mans partners. I\n                do not think that anything else has been said against him falsely by those who think\n                ill of him but this. For they are to be considered partners of a man, with whom the\n                gains of a business are shared. But I say that the whole of these gains, and the\n                whole of the fortunes of the cultivators, went to Verres alone. I say that Apronius,\n                and those slaves of Venus, who were quite a new class of farmers first heard of in\n                his praetorship! and the other collectors, were only agents of that one man's gains,\n                and ministers of his plunder. How do you prove that?  How did I prove that he had committed robbery in the contract for\n                those pillars? Chiefly, I think, by this fact, that he had put forth an unjust and\n                unprecedented law. For who ever attempted to change all the rights of people, and\n                the customs of all men, getting great blame for so doing, except for some gain? I\n                will proceed and carry this matter further. You sold the tenths according to an\n                unjust law, in order to sell them for more money. Why, when the tenths were now\n                knocked down and sold,when nothing could now be added to their sum total,\n                but much might be to your own gains,why did new edicts appear, made on a\n                sudden and to meet an emergency? For I say, that in your third year you issued\n                edicts, that a collector might summon a man before the court anywhere he liked; that\n                the cultivator might not remove his corn from the threshing-floor, before he had\n                settled the claims of the collector; that they should have the tenths delivered at\n                the water-side before the first of August. All these edicts, I say, you issued after\n                the tenths had been sold. But if you had issued them for the sake of the republic,\n                notice would have been given of them at the time of selling; because you were acting\n                with a view to your own interest, you, being prompted by your love of gain and by\n                the emergency, repaired the omission which had unintentionally occurred.  But who can be induced to believe thisthat you,\n                without any profit, or even without the greatest profit to yourself, disregarded the\n                great disgrace, the great danger to your position as a free man, and to your\n                fortunes, which you were incurring, so far as, though you were daily hearing the\n                groans and complaints of all ,though, as you yourself have said, you expected to be\n                brought to trial for this,though the hazard of this present trial is not\n                at all inconsistent with the opinion you yourself had formed,still to\n                allow the cultivators of the soil to be harassed and plundered with circumstances of\n                the most scandalous injustice? In truth, though you are a man of singular cruelty\n                and audacity, still you would be unwilling for a whole province to be alienated from\n                you,for so many most honourable men to be made your greatest enemies, if\n                your desire for money and present booty had not overcome all reason and all\n                consideration of safety.

He, in truth,\n                had no doubt that the man who, under the prompting of a mere love of justice, had\n                already accused another, would be ready as an accuser for him on his arrival, when\n                he was stimulated by the injuries of his father, and indignation at the treatment\n                received by his family."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "65", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "66", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "Do you now thoroughly understand, O judges, what a pest, what a barbarian has been\n                let loose in your most ancient, most loyal, and nearest province?

In the first year of your praetorship the\n                tenths of that district were sold for eighteen thousand \n                 of wheat. When Atidius, who was also his\n                servant in the matter of tenths, had purchased them, and when he had come to Herbita\n                with the title of' prefect, attended by the slaves of Verres, and when a place where\n                he might lodge had been assigned him by the public act of the city, the people of\n                Herbita are compelled to give him as a profit thirty-seven thousand  of wheat, when the tenths of the wheat had been sold at\n                eighteen thousand.

The influence of this woman\n                Tertia was greater with him than that of Pippa, or of all the other women, and I had\n                almost said, was as great in his Sicilian praetorship as that of Chelidon had been\n                in his city praetorship. There come to Herbita the two rivals of the praetor, not\n                likely to be troublesome to him, infamous agents of most abandoned women. They begin\n                to demand, to beg, to threaten; but though they wished it, they were not able to\n                imitate Apronius. The Sicilians were not so much afraid of Sicilians; still, as they\n                put forth false accusations in every possible way, the Herbitenses undertake to\n                appear in court at .

They said that they had no commission to give anything: I\n                do not hear you; pay him fifteen thousand . What were the wretched men to do I or how could\n                they refuse? especially when they saw the traces of the woman who was the collector\n                fresh in the bed, by which they understood that he had been inflamed to persevere in\n                his demand.

If, as you\n                are especially anxious to do, you could prove that these compliments all went to the\n                farmers, and that none of them reached you, still these sums, taken and extorted as\n                they were by your violence and injustice, ought to ensure your conviction; but, as\n                you cannot persuade any one that you were so foolish as to wish Apronius and Turpio,\n                two slaves, to become rich at your own risk and that of your children, do you think\n                that any one will doubt that through the instrumentality of those emissaries all\n                this money was really procured for you?  Again,\n                Symmachus, a slave of Venus, is sent as farmer to Segesta, a city exempt from such\n                taxes; he brings letters from Verres, to order the cultivators to appear in a court\n                of some other city than their own, contrary to every resolution of the senate, to\n                all their rights and privileges, and to the Rupilian law.

There is a man of the name of Diocles, a citizen of\n                  , surnamed Phimes, an\n                illustrious man, and of high reputation as an agriculturist, he rented a farm in the\n                Segestan district, (for there are no traders in that place,) for six thousand\n                  ; after having been assaulted by this slave\n                of Venus, he settled with him to give him sixteen thousand, six hundred, and\n                sixty-four .

Previously, when the\n                equestrian order furnished the judges, infamous and rapacious magistrates in the\n                provinces were subservient to the farmers; they honoured all who were in their\n                employ; every Roman knight whom they saw in the province they pursued with\n                attentions and courtesies; and that conduct was not so advantageous to the guilty,\n                as it was a hindrance to many if they had acted in any respect contrary to the\n                advantage or inclination of that body. This sort of principle was somehow or other\n                diligently reserved among them as if by common consent, that whoever had thought any\n                Roman knight deserving of any affront, was to be considered by their whole order as\n                deserving of every possible misfortune.  Did you\n                so despise the order of senators, did you so reduce everything to the standard of\n                your own insults and caprices, had you so deliberated and fixed it in your own mind\n                as an invariable rule, to reject as judges every one who dwelt in , or who had been in  while you were praetor, that it never\n                occurred to you that still you must come before judges of the same order? in whose\n                minds, even if there were no indignation from any personal injury done to\n                themselves, still there would be this thought, that they were affronted in the\n                affront offered to another, and that the dignity of their order was contemptuously\n                treated and trampled on, which, O judges, appears to me not to be endured with\n                patience, for insult has in it a sting which modest and virtuous men can with\n                difficulty put up with.  You have plundered the\n                Sicilians, for indeed the provincials are accustomed to obtain no revenge amid their\n                wrongs. You have harassed the brokers, for they seldom come to , and never of their own accord. You gave up a\n                Roman knight to the ill-treatment of Apronius. To be sure; for what harm can they do\n                you now, when they cannot be judges? What will you say when you treat senators also\n                with the greatest violence? what else can you say but this, Give me up\n                that senator also, in order that the most honourable name of senator may appear to\n                exist not only to excite the envy of the ignorant, but also to attract the insults\n                of the worthless.  Nor did he do this\n                in the case of Anneius alone, but in the instance of every senator, so that the name\n                of that order had not so much influence in procuring honour as insult for its\n                members. In the case of Caius Cassius, a most illustrious and most gallant man,\n                though he was consul at that very time, in the first year of his praetorship, he\n                behaved with such injustice, that, as his wife, a woman of the highest\n                respectability, had lands in Leontini, inherited from her father, he ordered all her\n                crops to be taken away for tenths.

The task allotted to my diligence is to be required of me rather in the\n                district of Leontini, for this reason, because the Leontini themselves have not\n                assisted me much by their public authority. Nor, in truth, while that fellow was\n                praetor, did these injuries of the farmers very greatly affect them, or rather, I\n                might say, they did them good. This may, perhaps, appear a marvellous or even an\n                incredible thing to you, that in such general distress of the cultivators of the\n                soil, the Leontini, who were the heads of the corn interest, should have been free\n                from injury and calamity. This is the reason, O judges, that in the territory of\n                Leontini, no one of the Leontini, with the exception of the single family of\n                Mnasistratus, occupies any land. And so, O judges, you shall hear the evidence of\n                Mnasistratus, a most honest and virtuous man. Do not expect to hear any others of\n                the Leontini, whom not only Apronius, but whom even a tempest in their fields could\n                not injure. They in truth not only suffered no inconvenience, but even in the rapine\n                of Apronius they found gain and advantage. \n                Wherefore, since the city and embassy of the Leontini has failed me on account of\n                the cause which I have mentioned, I must devise a plan and contrive a way for myself\n                by which I may get at the gain of Apronius, or even at his enormous and wicked\n                booty. The tenths of the Leontini territory were sold in the third year of Verres's\n                praetorship for thirty-six thousand  of wheat;\n                that is, for two hundred and twenty-six thousand \n                of wheat. A great price, O judges, a great price; and I cannot deny it. Therefore it\n                is certain that there must have been a loss, or at all events not a great gain to\n                the farmers. For this very often happens to men who have taken a contract at a high\n                rate.  What will you think if I prove to you\n                that, by this one purchase, there were made a hundred thousand  of profit? what if it was two hundred thousand? what if three?\n                what if four hundred thousand was the sum? Will you still doubt for whom that\n                immense booty was acquired? Will any one say that I am unfair if from the mere\n                magnitude of the gain made I form a conjecture as to the direction of the stolen\n                goods and plunder? What if I prove to you, O judges, that those men who are making\n                four hundred thousand  of profit would have\n                suffered a loss if your iniquity, O Verres, if judges of your retinue had not\n                stepped in? Can any one doubt, in a case of so much gain and so much iniquity, that\n                you made such immense profit by dishonest means? that for such immense gains you\n                were willing to be dishonest?"}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "medimnus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "medimni"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "medimni"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "medimni"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "medimnus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "medimni"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "113", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "48", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "How then, O judges, am I to arrive at this knowledge of how much profit was made?\n                Not from the accounts of Apronius, for when I sought for them, I could not find\n                them, and when I brought him into court, I made him deny that he kept any accounts\n                at all. If he was telling lies, why did he remove them out of the way, if they were\n                likely to do you no harm? If he really had kept any accounts at all, does not that\n                alone prove plainly enough, that it was not his own business that he was conducting?\n                For it is a quality of tenths, that they cannot be managed without many papers; for\n                it is necessary to keep an account of, and to set down in books the names of all the\n                cultivators, and with each name the amount of their tenth. All the cultivators made\n                returns of their acres according to your command and regulation; I do not believe\n                that any one made a return of a smaller quantity than he had in cultivation, when\n                there were so many crosses, so many penalties, so many judges of that retinue before\n                his eyes. On an acre of Leontini ground about a  of wheat is usually sown, according to the regular and\n                constant allowance of seed.

As this was the case, I say first of all,\n                that the tenths of the territory of Leontini were sold for many more thousand\n                   than there were thousands of acres sown in\n                the district of Leontini.

They\n                sent as a delegate to Apronius, Andron of Centuripa, a man among the first of his\n                state for honour and nobility, (the same man whom now the city of Centuripa has sent\n                to this trial as a deputy and as a witness,) in order that he might plead with him\n                the cause of the cultivators of the soil, and beg of him not to exact of the\n                Centuripan cultivators more than three  for each\n                acre.  This request was with difficulty obtained\n                from Apronius, as a most excessive kindness to those men who were even then safe.\n                And when this was obtained, this is what was obtained, forsooth, that they might be\n                allowed to pay three tenths instead of one.

Nor indeed was there anything of which any one could\n                complain, when they were sold according to a law most equitably framed; nor did it\n                ever make any difference to the cultivator at what price the tenths were sold. For\n                it is not the case that, if they be sold at a high price, the cultivator owes more,\n                if at a low price, less. As the crops are produced, so are the tenths sold. But it\n                is for the interest of the cultivator, that his crops should be such that the tenths\n                may be able to be sold at as high a price as possible. As long as the cultivator\n                does not give more than a tenth, it is for his interest that the tenth should be as\n                large as possible.

You cannot by any means deny this, unless you are\n                determined to deny everything. The business was transacted openly, in a full\n                assembly, at . The whole\n                province is the witness, because men are accustomed to flock together thither from\n                all parts at the sale or the tenths. And whether you confess this, or whether it be\n                proved against you, do you not see in what important and what evident acts you are\n                detected. First of all, it is proved that that business and that booty was yours.\n                For unless it was, why did you prefer that Acronius (who every one was saying was\n                only managing your affairs in the matter of the tenths as your agent) should get the\n                tenths of the Leontine district rather than Quintus Minucius? Secondly, that an\n                enormous and immense profit was made by you. For if you would not have been\n                influenced by thirty thousand  of wheat, at all\n                events Minucius would willingly have given thus much as a compliment to Apronius, if\n                he had been willing to accept it.  How great then\n                must we suppose the expectation of booty which he entertained to have been, when he\n                despised and scorned such vast present profit: acquired without the slightest\n                trouble. Thirdly, Minucius himself would never have wished to have them at such a\n                price, if you had been selling the tenths according to the Law of Hiero; but because\n                he saw that by your new edicts and most iniquitous resolutions he should get a good\n                deal more than tenths, on that account he advanced higher. But Apronius had always\n                even a good deal more permitted to him than you had announced in your edict. How\n                much gain then can we suppose was made by him to whom everything was permitted; when\n                that man was so willing to add so large a compliment, who would not have had the\n                same licence if he had bought the tenths? \n                Lastly, unquestionably that defence, under which you have constantly thought that\n                all your thefts and iniquities could be concealed, is cut from under your feet; that\n                you sold the tenths at a high pricethat you consulted the interest of the\n                Roman peoplethat you provided for plenty of provisions. He cannot say\n                this, who cannot deny that he sold the tenths of one district for thirty thousand\n                   less than he might have done; even if I were to\n                grant you this, that you did not grant them to Minucius because you had already\n                adjudged them to Apronius; for they say that that is what you are in the habit of\n                saying, and I am expecting to hear it, and I wish you would make that defence.

He demanded of Metellus\n                to give him a right of action according to the terms of his edict against Apronius,\n                for having taken away property by force or by fear, which\n                formula of Octavius, Metellus had both adopted at , and now imported into the province. He does not succeed; as\n                Metellus said that he did not wish by means of such a trial to prejudge the case of\n                Verres himself in a matter affecting his condition as a free citizen. The whole\n                retinue of Metellus, grateful men, stood by Apronius. Caius Gallius, a man of our\n                order, cannot obtain from Lucius Metellus, his most intimate friend, a trial in\n                accordance with his own edict.  I do not blame\n                Metellus; he spared a friend of hisa connection, indeed, as I have heard\n                him say himself. I do not, I say, blame Metellus; but I do marvel how he not only\n                prejudged the case of a man concerning whom he was unwilling that any previous\n                decision should take place by means of judges, but even judged most severely and\n                harshly respecting him. For, in the first place, if he thought that Apronius would\n                be acquitted, there was no reason for his fearing any previous decision. In the\n                second place, if Apronius were condemned, all men were likely to think that the\n                cause of Verres was involved in his; this at all events Metellus did now decide, and\n                he determined that their affairs and their causes were identical, since he\n                determined that, if Apronius were condemned, it would be a prejudging of the case of\n                Verres. And one fact is at the same time a proof of two things; both that the\n                cultivators gave much more than they owed to Apronius because they were constrained\n                by violence and fear; and also, that Apronius was transacting Verres's business in\n                his own name, since Lucius Metellus determined that Apronius could not be condemned\n                without giving a decision at the same time respecting the wickedness and dishonesty\n                of Verres."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}, "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "accensus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "accensus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Accensi"}], "#text": "The Latin is .

O Timarchides, the son of Metellus is in the\n                province, not a boy, but a virtuous and modest youth, worthy of his rank and name.\n                How that boy of yours had behaved in the province, I would not say if I thought it\n                the fault of the boy, and not the fault of his father. Did not you, though you knew\n                yourself and your own habits of life, O Verres, take with you your son, still clad\n                in the robes of a boy, into , so that\n                even if nature had separated the boy from his father's vices and from every\n                resemblance to his family, still habit and training might prevent his degenerating\n                from them?

Of corn\n                derived from the second tenths the quantity would be as much as had been derived\n                from the first tenths; of corn levied on the cities in this way there would be eight\n                hundred thousand . The price fixed for the corn\n                collected as the second tenths was three  a\n                  ; for that furnished in compliance with the\n                levy, four . Accordingly, for the corn\n                furnished in compliance with the levy, there was paid to Verres each year three\n                million two hundred thousand , which he was to\n                pay to the cultivators of the soil; and for the second tenths, about nine millions\n                of . And so, during the three years, there was\n                nearly thirty-six million six hundred thousand  paid to him for this purchase of corn in .  This\n                enormous sum of money, given to you out of a poor and exhausted treasury; given to\n                you for corn,that is to say, for what was necessary for the safety and\n                life of the citizens; given to you to be paid to the Sicilian cultivators of the\n                soil, on whom the republic was imposing such great burdens;this great\n                sum, I say, was so handled by you, that I can prove, if I choose, that you\n                appropriated the whole of this money, and that it all went to your own house. In\n                fact, you managed the whole affair in such a way that this which I say can be proved\n                to the most impartial judge. But I will have a regard for my own authority, I will\n                recollect with what feelings, with what intentions I have undertaken the advocacy of\n                this public cause. I will not deal with you in the spirit of an accuser; I will\n                invent nothing; I do not wish any one to take for proved, while I am speaking,\n                anything of which I myself do not already feel thoroughly convinced.  In the ease of this public money, O judges, there are\n                three kinds of thefts. In the first place, he put it out among the companies from\n                which it had been drawn at twenty-four per cent interest;  in the second place, he paid actually\n                nothing at all for corn to very many of the cities; lastly, if he did pay any city,\n                he deducted as large a sum as ever he chose. He paid no one whatever as much as was\n                due to him."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "166", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "167", "@unit": "section"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "#text": "And first I ask you thisyou, to whom the farmers of the revenue,\n                according to the letters of Carpinatius, gave thanks.

Immense sums of money were\n                entrusted to him when praetor. You will not find him a man to lick up these most\n                infamous profits nervously and gently; he did not hesitate to swallow up at a gulp\n                the whole of the public money. That wicked covetousness, when it is implanted in a\n                man's nature, creeps on in such a way, when the habit of sinning has emancipated\n                itself from restraint, that it is not able to put any limits to its audacity.\n                   At length it is detected, and it is detected\n                in affairs of great importance, and of undoubted certainty. And it seems to me that,\n                by the interposition of the gods, this man too has become involved in such\n                dishonesty, as not only to suffer punishment for the crimes which he has lately\n                committed, but also to be overwhelmed with the vengeance due to the sins which he\n                committed against Carbo and against Dolabella."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "modii"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "medimnus"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "medimus"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "179", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "180", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "78", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "181", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "There is in truth also another new feature in this crime, O judges, which will\n                remove all doubts as to his criminality on the former charge respecting the tenths.\n                For, to say nothing of this fact, that very many of the cultivators of the soil had\n                not corn enough for the second tenths, and for those eight thousand  which they were bound to sell to the Roman people, but\n                that they bought them of your agent, that is, of Apronius; which is a clear proof\n                that you had left the cultivators actually nothing: to pass over this, which teas\n                been clearly set forth in many men's evidence, can anything be more certain than\n                this,that all the corn of , and all the crops of the land liable to the payment of tenths,\n                were for three years in your power and in your barns?  for when you were demanding of the cities money for corn, whence\n                was the corn to be procured for you to send to , if you had it not all collected and locked up?

Nor did you only present your clerk with a ring, but you also presented a\n                man of great bravery, a man very unlike yourself, Quintus Rubrius, a man of eminent\n                virtue, and dignity, and riches, with a crown, with horse trappings, and a chain;\n                and also Marcus Cossutius, a most conscientious and honourable man, and Marcus\n                Castritius, a man of the greatest wealth, and ability, and influence.

Where did all these presents come from? from the spoils of what\n                enemy? gained in what victory? Of what booty or trophies do they make a part?

Moreover, what was the preface to this\n                present? Was it the old one used by the generals?Since in\n                battle, in war, in military affairs, you....

In truth this\n                valuation originated, O judges, at first not in the convenience of the praetors or\n                consuls, but in the advantage to the cultivators and the cities. For originally, no\n                one was so impudent as to demand money when it was corn that was due; certainly this\n                proceeded in the first instance from the cultivator or from the city which was\n                required to furnish corn; when they had either sold the corn, or wished to keep it,\n                or were not willing to carry it to that place where it was required to be delivered,\n                they begged as a kindness and a favour, that they might be allowed, instead of the\n                corn, to give the value of the corn. From such a commencement as this, and from the\n                liberality and accommodating spirit of the magistrates the custom of valuations was\n                introduced.

He, when in the senate at Entella he was discussing with\n                me the injustice of Verres, said this: that, if the question of the granaries and of\n                the valuation were conceded, the Sicilians were willing to promise the senate corn\n                for the granary without payment, so that we need not for the future vote such large\n                sums to our magistrates.  I am sure that you\n                clearly perceive how advantageous this would be for the Sicilians not because of the\n                justice of such a condition, but in the way of choosing the least of two evils; for\n                the man who had given Verres a thousand  for the\n                granary as his share of the contribution required, would have given two, or, at\n                most, three thousand , but the same man has\n                now been compelled for the same quantity of corn to give eight thousand . A cultivator could not stand this for three years,\n                at least not out of his own produce. He must inevitably have sold his stock. But if\n                the land can endure this contribution and this tribute,that is to say, if\n                   can bear and support it, let it\n                pay it to the Roman people rather than to our magistrates.

If they can provide it, let it be\n                the revenue of the Roman people rather than the plunder of the praetor.  In the next place, why is that valuation established for\n                only one description of corn? If it is just and endurable, then  owes the Roman people tenths; let it give\n                three  for each single  of wheat; let it keep the corn itself.

Are you going to bring me back to the valuation of the corn, and\n                the exaction of money by Marcus Antonius? Just so, says he; to the valuation of\n                Marcus Antonius. For this is what he seemed to mean by his signs and nods. Out of\n                all the praetors of the Roman people then, and consuls, and generals, have you\n                selected Marcus Antonius, and even the most infamous action done by him, for your\n                imitation? And here is it difficult for me to say, or for the judges to think, that\n                in that unlimited authority Marcus Antonius behaved himself in such a manner, that\n                it is by far more injurious to Verres to say that as he, in a most infamous\n                transaction, wished to imitate Antonius, than if he were able to allege in his\n                defence, that he had never in his whole life done anything like Marcus Antonius? Men\n                in trials are accustomed to allege, in making a defence against an accusation, not\n                what any one did, but what he did that was good. In the middle of his course of\n                injustice and covetousness death overtook Antony, while he was still both doing and\n                planning many things contrary to the safety of the allies many things contrary to\n                the advantage of our provinces.

They made a\n                law, therefore, that no one should buy a slave except in the room of a\n                slave who was dead. If any slave had died at ? No, if any one had died in the place where\n                his master was. For they did not mean you to furnish your house in the province, but\n                to be of use to the province in its necessities. \n                What was the reason why they so carefully kept us from making purchases in the\n                provinces? This was it, O judges, because they thought it a robbery, not a purchase,\n                when the seller was not allowed to sell on his own terms. And they were aware that,\n                in the provinces, if he who was there with the command and power  of a governor wished to purchase what was\n                in any one's possession, and was allowed to do so, it would come to pass that he\n                would get whatever he chose, whether it was to be sold or not, at whatever price he\n                pleased.

I will so deal with him.

We must\n                ask, I suppose, whether Heius was in debt, whether he had an auction,if\n                he had, whether he was in such difficulties about money matters, whether he was\n                oppressed by such want, by such necessity, as to strip his private chapel, to sell\n                his paternal gods.

Even if all these things were contrary to what\n                I say they were, still I say that he would not have sold things which had been so\n                many years in the household and chapel of his ancestors.

For he would never have\n                been so foolish, if he had thought that Cupid worth only four hundred , as to allow himself to be made a subject for the\n                common conversation and general reproach of men. \n                Who then of you all is ignorant at how great a price these things are valued? Have\n                we not seen at an auction a brazen statue of no great size sold for a hundred and\n                twenty thousand ? What if I were to choose to\n                name men who have bought similar things for no less a price, or even for a higher\n                one? Can I not do so? In truth, the only limit to the valuation of such things is\n                the desire which any one has for them, for it is difficult to set bounds to the\n                price unless you first set bounds to the wish. I see then that Heius was neither led\n                by his inclination, nor by any temporary difficulties, nor by the greatness of the\n                sum given, to sell these statues; and that you, under the presence of purchase which\n                you put forward, in reality seized and took away these things by force, through\n                fear, by your power and authority, from that man, whom, along with the rest of our\n                allies in that country, the Roman people had entrusted not only to your power, but\n                also to your upright exercise of it.  What can\n                there be, judges, so desirable for me in making this charge, as that Heius should\n                say this same thing? Nothing certainly; but let us not wish for what is difficult to\n                be obtained. Heius is a Mamertine. The state of the Mamertines alone, by a common\n                resolution, praises that man in the name of the city. To all the rest of the\n                Sicilians he is an object of hatred; by the Mamertines alone is he liked. But of\n                that deputation which has been sent to utter his praises, Heius is the chief man; in\n                truth, he is the chief man of his city, and too much occupied in discharging the\n                public duties imposed upon him to speak of his private injuries.  Though I was aware of and had given weight to these\n                considerations, still, O judges, I trusted myself to Heius. I produced him at the\n                first pleading; and indeed I did it without any danger, for what answer could Heius\n                give even if he turned out a dishonest man, and unlike himself? Could he say that\n                these statues were at his house, and not with Verres? How could he say anything of\n                that sort? If he were the basest of men, and were inclined to lie most shamelessly,\n                he would say this; that he had had them for sale, and that he had sold them at the\n                price he wanted for them. The man the most noble in all his city, who was especially\n                anxious that you should have a high opinion of his conscientiousness and of his\n                worth, says first, that he spoke in Verres's praise by the public authority of his\n                city, because that commission had been given to him; secondly; that he had not had\n                these things for sale, and that, if he had been allowed to do what he wished, he\n                could never have been induced by any terms to sell those things which were in his\n                private chapel, having been left to him and handed down to him from his ancestors."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003947", "#text": "Catina"}, {"@key": "perseus,Tyndaris", "#text": "Tyndaris"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003916", "#text": "Enna"}, {"@key": "tgn,1043116", "#text": "Agyrium"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003897", "#text": "Messana"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003897", "#text": "Messana"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003897", "#text": "Messana"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003897", "#text": "Messana"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "18", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "9", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "19", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Why are you sitting there, O Verres?

Although there is a law for recovering money which has\n                been unjustly extorted, he says that he does not seem to recover any money; which\n                though it has been taken from him, he does not so much care about: but he says he\n                does demand back from you the sacred images belonging to his ancestors, he does\n                demand back from you his hereditary household god?

They were bound to supply and they used to supply sixty\n                thousand  of wheat to the Roman people for\n                payment; that was remitted by you of your own sole authority. The republic was\n                injured because by your means its right of dominion over one city was disparaged;\n                the Sicilians were injured, because this quantity was not deducted from the total\n                amount of the corn to be provided by the island, but was only transferred to the\n                cities of Centuripa and Halesa, whose inhabitants were exempt from that tax; and on\n                them a greater burden was imposed than they were able to bear.  It was your duty to require them to furnish a ship, in compliance\n                with the treaty. You remitted it for three years. During all those years you never\n                demanded one soldier. You acted as pirates are accustomed to act, who, though they\n                are the common enemies of all men, still select some friends, whom they not only\n                spare, but even enrich with their booty; and especially such as have a town in a\n                convenient situation, where they often, and sometimes even necessarily, put in with\n                their vessels."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7002470", "#text": "Cilicia"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "22", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "23", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "24", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "11", "@unit": "chapter"}], "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, "#text": "The town of Phaselis, which Publius Servilius took, had not been in former times a\n                city of Cilicians and pirates.

The city of the Mamertines was not formerly of bad character; it\n                was even a city hostile to dishonest men, and detained the luggage of Caius Cato,\n                the one who was consul But then what sort of a man was he? a most eminent and most\n                influential man; who however, though he had been consul, was convicted. So Caius\n                Cato, the grandson of two most illustrious men, Lucius Paullus and Marcus Cato, and\n                the son of the sister of Publius Africanus; who, even when convicted, at a time when\n                severe judgments were in the habit of being passed, found the damages to which he\n                was liable only estimated at eighteen thousand ; with this man, I say, the Mamertines were angry, who have\n                often expended a greater sum than the damages in the action against Cato were laid\n                at, in one banquet for Timarchides.  But this city\n                was the Phaselis for that robber and pirate of . Hither everything was brought from all quarters; with them it\n                was left; whatever required to be concealed, they kept separate and stored away. By\n                their agency he contrived everything which he wished put on board ship privately,\n                and exported secretly; and in their harbour he contrived to have a vessel of the\n                largest size built for him to send to \n                loaded with plunder. In return for these services, he gave them immunity from all\n                expense, all labour, all military service, in short, from everything. For three\n                years they were the only people, not only in , but, according to my opinion, in the whole world at such a\n                time, who enjoyed excuse, relief, freedom, and immunity from every sort of expense,\n                and trouble, and office.  Hence arose that Verrean\n                festival; hence it was that he ventured to order Sextus Cominius to be dragged\n                before him at a banquet, at whom he attempted to throw a goblet, whom he ordered to\n                be seized by the throat, and to be hurried from the banquet and thrown into a dark\n                prison; hence came that cross, on which, in the sight of many men, he suspended a\n                Roman citizen; that cross which he never ventured to erect anywhere except among\n                that people, whom he had made sharers in all his crimes and robberies."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "25", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "26", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "12", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "section"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,7004296", "#text": "Rhegium"}], "#text": "Do you, O Mamertines, dare to come to praise any one?

You might have bought them in the\n                same way as you did the statues. For what did you do? Did you wish to spare the\n                account books?

But how did he get it? I cannot relate it more plainly than Heius\n                himself related it before you. When I asked, whether any other part of his property\n                had come to Verres, he answered that he had sent him orders to send the tapestry to\n                   to him.

Did it never occur to you in this instance to order him to make\n                an entry in his books, that he had sold you this tapestry too, for six thousand five\n                hundred ? Did you fear that your debts would\n                increase, if these things were to cost you six thousand five hundred , which you could easily sell for two hundred\n                thousand? It was worth that, believe me. You would have been able to defend yourself\n                if you had given that sum for it. No one would then have asked how much it was\n                worth. If you could only prove that you had bought it, you could easily make your\n                cause and your conduct appear reasonable to any one.

When I was in , this is what I heard from the Centuripans\n                and from everybody else, for the case was very notorious; people said that you had\n                taken away this harness from Philarchus of Centuripa, and other very beautiful\n                harness from Aristus of , and\n                a third set from Gratippus of Tyndarus. Indeed, if Philarchus had sold it to you,\n                you would not, after the prosecution was instituted against you, have promised to\n                restore it. But because you saw that many people knew of it, you thought that if you\n                restored it to him, you would only have so much the less, but the original\n                transaction would be proved against you nevertheless; and so you did not restore it.\n                Philarchus said in his evidence, that when he became acquainted with this disease of\n                yours, as your friends call it, he wished to conceal from you the knowledge of the\n                existence of this harness; that when he was summoned by you, he said that he had not\n                got any; and indeed, that he had removed them to another person's house, that they\n                might not be found; but that your instinct was so great, that you saw them by the\n                assistance of the very man in whose custody they were deposited; that then he could\n                not deny that you had found him out, and so that the harness was taken from him\n                against his will, and without any payment."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Cibyra", "#text": "Cibyra"}, {"@key": "perseus,Cibyra", "#text": "Cibyra"}, {"@key": "perseus,Cibyra", "#text": "Cibyra"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000004", "#text": "Asia"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "31", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "14", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "32", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Now, O judges, it is worth your while to know how he was accustomed to find and\n                trace out all these things.

As they had known that Verres\n                was a great connoisseur of such works as theirs, at the time that he, as you learnt\n                from the witnesses, came to  with\n                fictitious bills of exchange, they, when flying from their homes as exiles, came to\n                him when he was in .

I recollect that Pamphilus of\n                  , a connection of mine by ties\n                of hospitality, and a personal friend of mine, a man of the highest birth, told me,\n                that when that man had taken from him, by his absolute power, an ewer made by the\n                hand of Boethus, of exquisite workmanship and great weight, he went home very sad in\n                truth, and greatly agitated, because a vessel of that sort, which had been left to\n                him by his father and his forefathers, and which he was accustomed to use on days of\n                festival, and on the arrival of ancient friends, had been taken from him. While I\n                was sitting at home, said he, in great indignation, up comes one of the slaves of\n                Venus; he orders me immediately to bring to the praetor some embossed goblets. I was\n                greatly vexed, said he; I had two; I order them both to be taken out of the closet,\n                lest any worse thing should happen, and to be brought after me to the praetor's\n                house. When I got there the praetor was asleep; the Cibyratic brothers were walking\n                about, and when they saw me, they said, Pamphilus, where are the cups? I show them\n                with great grief;they praise them.I begin to complain that I\n                shall have nothing left of any value at all, if my cups too were taken away. Then\n                they, when they see me vexed, say, What are you willing to give us to prevent these\n                from being taken from you? To make my story short, I said that I would give six\n                hundred . Meantime the praetor summons us; he\n                asks for the cups. Then they began to say to the praetor, that they had thought from\n                what they had heard, that Pamphilus's cups were of some value, but that they were\n                miserable things, quite unworthy of Verres's having them among his plate. He said,\n                he thought so too.  So Pamphilus saved his\n                exquisite goblets. And indeed, before I heard this, though I knew that it was a very\n                trifling sort of accomplishment to understand things of that sort, yet I used to\n                wonder that he had any knowledge of them at all, as I knew that in nothing whatever\n                had he any qualities like a man."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "34", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "16", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "35", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "But when I heard this, I then for the first time understood that that was the use\n                of these two Cibyratic brothers; that in his robberies he used his own hands, but\n                their eyes. But he was so covetous of that splendid reputation of being thought to\n                be a judge of such matters, that lately, (just observe the man's madness,) after his\n                case was adjourned, when he was already as good as condemned, and civilly dead, at\n                the time of the games of the circus, when early in the morning the couches were\n                spread in preparation for a banquet at the house of Lucius Sisenna, a man of the\n                first consideration, and when the plate was all set out, and when, as was suited to\n                the dignity of Lucius Sisenna, the house was full of honourable men, he came to the\n                plate, and began in a leisurely way to examine and consider every separate piece.\n                Some marveled at the folly of the man, who, while his trial was actually going on,\n                was increasing the suspicion of that covetousness of which he was accused; others\n                marveled at his insensibility, that any such things could come into his head, when\n                the time for judgment in his cause was so near at hand, and when so many witnesses\n                had spoken against him.

It is reported to Verres of this man that he has some\n                exceedingly fine specimens of chased work; and among them two goblets called\n                Thericlean,  made by the hand of\n                mentor with the most exquisite skill. And when Verres heard of this, he was inflamed\n                with such a desire, not only of beholding, but also of appropriating them, that he\n                summoned Diodorus, and demanded them. He replied, as was natural for a man who took\n                great pride in them, that he had not got them at ; that he had left them at , in the house of a relation of his.  On this he immediately sends men on whom he can rely to\n                  ; he writes to certain inhabitants\n                of  to search out those vessels for\n                him; he desires Diodorus to give them letters to that relation of histhe\n                time appeared to him endless till he could see those pieces of plate. Diodorus, a\n                prudent and careful man, who wished to keep his own property, writes to his relation\n                to make answer to those men who came from Verres, that he had sent the cups to\n                   a few days before. In the\n                meantime he himself leaves the place. He preferred leaving his home, to staying in\n                it and losing that exquisitely wrought silver work.

Because he could not steal the plate himself, he said that he had been\n                robbed by Diodorus of some exquisitely wrought vessels; he poured out threats\n                against the absent Diodorus; he used to roar out before people; sometimes he could\n                not restrain his tears.

His\n                covetousness was similar; but in one respect more violent and more senseless,\n                because she was desiring a thing which she had seen, while his wishes were excited\n                not only by his eyes, but even by his ears."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7005730", "#text": "Melita"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "41", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "42", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "20", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "He orders Diodorus to be sought for over the whole province.

He sets up one of the men he calls his hounds, to say that he\n                wishes to institute a prosecution against Diodorus of  for a capital offence. At first all men wondered at such a\n                thing being imputed to Diodorus, a most quiet man, and as far removed as any man\n                from all suspicion, not only of crime, but of even the slightest irregularity. But\n                it soon became evident, that all this was done for the sake of his silver. Verres\n                does not hesitate to order the prosecution to be instituted; and that, I imagine,\n                was the first instance of his allowing an accusation to be made against an absent\n                man.  The matter was notorious over all , that men were prosecuted for capital\n                offences because the praetor coveted their chased silver plate; and that\n                prosecutions were instituted against them not only when they were present, but even\n                in their absence. Diodorus goes to ,\n                and putting on mourning, calls on all his patrons and friends; relates the affair to\n                every one. Earnest letters are written to Verres by his father, and by his friends,\n                warning him to take care what he did, and what steps he took respecting Diodorus;\n                that the matter was notorious and very unpopular; that he must be out of his senses;\n                that this one charge would ruin him if he did not take care. At that time he\n                considered his father, if not in the light of a parent, at least in that of a man.\n                He had not yet sufficiently prepared himself for a trial; it was his first year in\n                the province; he was not, as he was by the time of the affair of Sthenius, loaded\n                with money. And so his frenzy was checked a little, not by shame, but by fear and\n                alarm. He does not dare to condemn Diodorus; he takes his name out of the list of\n                defendants while he is absent. In the meantime Diodorus, for nearly three years, as\n                long as that man was praetor, was banished from the province and from his home.\n                   Every one else, not only Sicilians, but Roman\n                citizens too, settled this in their minds, that, since he had carried his\n                covetousness to such an extent, there was nothing which any one could expect to\n                preserve or retain in his own possession if it was admired ever so little by Verres."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "43", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "44", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "45", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "21", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "46", "@unit": "section"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}], "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, "#text": "But after they understood that that brave man, Quintus Arrius, whom the province\n                was eagerly looking for, was not his successor, they then settled that they could\n                keep nothing so carefully shut up or hidden away, as not to be most open and visible\n                to his covetousness. After that, he took away from an honourable and highly esteemed\n                Roman knight, named Cnaeus Salidius, whose son he knew to be a senator of the Roman\n                people and a judge, some beautiful silver horses which had belonged to Quintus\n                Maximus.

Lastly, I do not suppose you will deny that by the intervention\n                of Potamo, a friend of yours, you restored his plate to Lucius Cordius, an\n                honourable man, but not more highly esteemed than Cnaeus Calidius; and it was he who\n                made the cause of the rest more difficult to plead before you; for though you had\n                promised many men to restore them their property, yet, after Cordius had stated in\n                his evidence that you had restored him his, you desisted from making any more\n                restorations, because you saw that you lost your plunder, and yet could not escape\n                the evidence against you. Under all other praetors Cnaeus Calidius, a Roman knight,\n                was allowed to have plate finely wrought; he was permitted to be able from his own\n                stores to adorn and furnish a banquet handsomely, when he had invited a magistrate\n                or any superior officer. Many men in power and authority have been with Cnaeus\n                Calidius at his house; no one was ever found so mad as to take from him that\n                admirable and splendid plate; no one was found bold enough to ask for it; no one\n                impudent enough to beg him to sell it.  For it is\n                an arrogant thing, an intolerable thing, O judges, for a praetor to say to an\n                honourable, and rich, and well-appointed man in his province, Sell me\n                those chased goblets. For it is saying, You do not deserve to\n                have things which are so beautifully made; they are better suited to a man of my\n                stamp. Are you, O Verres, more worthy than Calidius? whom (not to compare\n                your way of life with his, for they are not to be compared, but) I will compare you\n                with in respect of this very dignity owing to which you make yourself out his\n                superior.

Is it on that account that it seemed to\n                you a scandalous thing that Calidius should have anything that you admired rather\n                than that you should?"}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "47", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "22", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "48", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "He has been long boasting of this transaction with Calidius, and telling every one\n                that he bought the things.

Nor was this\n                abstinence exercised only in the case of Papirius; he practiced exactly the same\n                conduct with respect to every censer in ; and it is quite incredible how many beautifully wrought\n                censers there were. I imagine that, when  was at the height of its power and opulence, there were\n                extensive workshops in that island; for before that man went thither as praetor\n                there was no house tolerably rich, in which there were not these things, even if\n                there was no other silver plate besides; namely, a large dish with figures and\n                images of the gods embossed on it, a goblet which the women used for sacred\n                purposes, and a censer. And all these were antique, and executed with the most\n                admirable skill, so that one may suspect everything else in  was on a similar scale of magnificence; but\n                that though fortune had deprived them of much, those things were still preserved\n                among them which were retained for purposes of religion.  I said just now, O judges, that there were many censers, in\n                almost every house in fact; I assert also, that now there is not even one left.

That noble man, as one who wished to be loved and\n                esteemed by his fellow citizens, was very indignant at having such an office imposed\n                upon him, and did not know what to do. He announces the commands he has received. He\n                orders every one to produce what they had. There was great consternation, for the\n                tyrant himself had not gone away to any distance; lying on a litter by the sea-side\n                below the town, he was waiting for Archagathus and the silver plate. What a\n                gathering of people do you suppose took place in the sown? what an uproar? what\n                weeping of women? they who saw it would have said that the Trojan horse had been\n                introduced, and that the city was taken.  Vessels\n                were brought out without their cases; others were wrenched out of the hands of\n                women; many people's doors were broken open, and their locks forced. For what else\n                can you suppose? Even if ever, at a time of war and tumult, arms are demanded of\n                private citizens, still men give them unwillingly, though they know that they are\n                giving them for the common safety. Do not suppose then that any one produced his\n                carved plate out of his house for another man to steal, without the greatest\n                distress. Everything is brought down to the shore. The Cibyratic brothers are\n                summoned; they condemn some articles; whatever they approve of has its figures in\n                relief or its embossed emblems torn off.

Archagathus found a few who\n                would accept the money, and those he paid. And still Verres never paid Archagathus\n                that money.

He\n                displays all his treasures; much silver, also not a few goblets of gold, which, as\n                is the custom of kings, and especially in , were studded all over with most splendid jewels. There was\n                also a vessel for wine, a ladle hollowed out of one single large precious stone,\n                with a golden handle, concerning which, I think, you heard Quintus Minutius speak, a\n                sufficiently capable judge, and sufficiently credible witness.  Verres took each separate piece of plate into his hands, praised\n                itadmired it. The king was delighted that that banquet was tolerably\n                pleasant and agreeable to a praetor of the Roman people. After the banquet was over,\n                Verres thought of nothing else, as the facts themselves showed, than how he might\n                plunder and strip the king of everything before he departed from the province. He\n                sends to ask for the most exquisite of the vessels which he had seen at Antiochus's\n                lodgings. He said that he wished to show them to his engravers. The king, who did\n                not know the man, most willingly sent them, without any suspicion of his intention.\n                He sends also to borrow the jeweled ladle.

Besides that, he used to summon their magistrates\n                before him; he used to send for all the most noble and most virtuous of the\n                citizens, to hurry them about with him to all the courts of justice in the province,\n                to threaten every one of them separately to be the ruin of him, and to announce to\n                them all in a body that he would utterly destroy their city. Therefore, at last, the\n                Segestans, subdued by much ill-treatment and by great fear, resolved to obey the\n                command of the praetor. With great grief and lamentation on the part of the whole\n                city, with many tears and wailings on the part of all the men and women, a contract\n                is advertised for taking down the statue of Diana."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003850", "#text": "Lilybaeum"}, {"@key": "perseus,Carthage", "#text": "Carthage"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "78", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "79", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "36", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "See now with what religious reverence it is regarded.

How different\n                from that time did this day seem! then the general of the Roman people, a most\n                illustrious man, was bringing back to the Segestans the gods of their fathers,\n                recovered from an enemy's city; now a most base and profligate praetor of the same\n                Roman people, was taking away, with the most nefarious wickedness, those very same\n                gods from a city of his allies.

And when this crime had been executed, as the pedestal was\n                empty, and the name of Publius Africanus carved on it, the affair appeared\n                scandalous and intolerable to every one, that not only was religion trampled on, but\n                also that Caius Verres had taken away the glory of the exploits, the memorial of the\n                virtues, the monument of the victory of Publius Africanus, that most gallant of men.\n                   But when he was told afterwards of the pedestal\n                and the inscription, he thought that men would forget the whole affair, if he took\n                away the pedestal to which was serving as a sort of signpost to point out his crime.\n                And so, by his command, the Segestans contracted to take away the pedestal too; and\n                the terms of that contract were read to you from the public registers of the\n                Segestans, at the former pleading."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "80", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "37", "@unit": "chapter"}], "placeName": {"@key": "perseus,Carthage", "#text": "Carthage"}, "#text": "Now, O Publius Scipio, I appeal to you; to you, I say, a most virtuous and\n                accomplished youth; from you I request and demand that assistance which is due to\n                your family and to your name.

And when, O judges, he had privately\n                committed that atrocity, and when in that most nefarious crime and robbery he had\n                employed some of the most worthless men of the city as his guides and assistants,\n                the whole city was greatly excited. For the Agrigentines were regretting at the same\n                time the kindness of Africanus, and a national object of their worship, and an\n                ornament of their city, and a record of their victory, and an evidence of their\n                alliance with us. And therefore a command is imposed on those men who were the chief\n                men of the city, and a charge is given to the quaestors and aediles to keep watch by\n                night over the sacred edifices. And, indeed, at , (I imagine, on account of the great number and virtue of\n                these men, and because great numbers of Roman citizens, gallant and intrepid and\n                honourable men, live and trade in that town among the Agrigentines in the greatest\n                harmony,) he did not dare openly to carry off, or even to beg for the things that\n                took his fancy.  There is a temple of Hercules at\n                  , not far from the forum,\n                considered very holy and greatly reverenced among the citizens. In it there is a\n                brazen image of Hercules himself, than which I cannot easily tell where I have seen\n                anything finer; (although I am not very much of a judge of those matters, though I\n                have seen plenty of specimens;) so greatly venerated among them, O judges, that his\n                mouth and his chin are a little worn away, because men in addressing their prayers\n                and congratulations to him, are accustomed not only to worship the statue, but even\n                to kiss it. While Verres was at ,\n                on a sudden, one stormy night, a great assemblage of armed slaves, and a great\n                attack on this temple by them, takes place, under the leading of Timarchides. A cry\n                is raised by the watchmen and guardians of the temple. And, at first, when they\n                attempted to resist them and to defend the temple, they are driven back much injured\n                with sticks and bludgeons. Afterwards, when the bolts were forced open, and the\n                doors dashed in, they endeavour to pull down the statue and to overthrow it with\n                levers; meantime, from the outcries of the keepers, a report got abroad over the\n                whole city, that the national gods were being stormed, not by the unexpected\n                invasion of enemies, or by the sudden irruption of pirates, but that a well armed\n                and fully equipped band of fugitive slaves from the house and retinue of the praetor\n                had attacked them.  No one in  was either so advanced in age, or so\n                infirm in strength, as not to rise up on that night, awakened by that news, and to\n                seize whatever weapon chance put into his hands. So in a very short time men are\n                assembled at the temple from every part of the city. Already, for more than an hour,\n                numbers of men had been labouring at pulling down that statue; and all that time it\n                gave no sign of being shaken in any part; while some, putting levers under it, were\n                endeavouring to throw it down, and others, having bound cords to all its limbs, were\n                trying to pull it towards them. On a sudden all the Agrigentines collect together at\n                the place; stones are thrown in numbers; the nocturnal soldiers of that illustrious\n                commander run awaybut they take with them two very small statues, in\n                order not to return to that robber of all holy things entirely empty-handed. The\n                Sicilians are never in such distress as not to be able to say something facetious\n                and neat; as they did on this occasion. And so they said that this enormous boar had\n                a right to be accounted one of the labours of Hercules, no less than the other boar\n                of Erymanthus."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7003916", "#text": "Enna"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "97", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "98", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "45", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "99", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "The people of Assorum, gallant and loyal men, afterwards imitated this brave\n                conduct of the Agrigentines, though they did not come of so powerful or so\n                distinguished a city. There is a river called Chrysas, which flows through the\n                territories of Assorum. Chrysas, among that people, is considered a god, and is\n                worshipped with the greatest reverence. His temple is in the fields, near the road\n                which goes from Assorum to . In it\n                there is an image of Chrysas, exquisitely made of marble. He did not dare to beg\n                that of the Assorians on account of the extraordinary sanctity of that temple; so he\n                entrusts the business to Tlepolemus and Hiero. They, having prepared and armed a\n                body of men, come by night; they break in the doors of the temple; the keepers of\n                the temple and the guardians hear them in time. A trumpet the signal of alarm well\n                known to all the neighbourhood, is sounded; men come in from the country, Tlepolemus\n                is turned out and put to fight; nor was anything missed out of the temple of Chrysas\n                except one very diminutive image of brass.  There\n                is a temple of the mighty mother Cybele at Enguinum, for I must new not only mention\n                each instance with the greatest brevity, but I must even pass over a great many, in\n                order to come to the greater and more remarkable thefts and atrocities of this sort\n                which this man has committed. In this temple that same Publius Scipio, a man\n                excelling in every possible good quality, had placed breastplates and helmets of\n                brass of Corinthian workmanship, and some huge ewers of a similar description, and\n                wrought with the same exquisite skill, and had inscribed his own name upon them. Why\n                should I make any more statements or utter any further complaints about that man's\n                conduct? He took away, O judges, every one of those things. He left nothing in that\n                most holy temple except the traces of the religion he had trampled on, and the name\n                of Publius Scipio. The spoils won from the enemy, the memorials of our commanders,\n                the ornaments and decorations of our temples, will hereafter, when these illustrious\n                names are lost, be reckoned in the furniture and appointments of Caius Verres.\n                   Are you, forsooth, the only man who delights in\n                Corinthian vases? Are you the best judge in the world of the mixture of that\n                celebrated bronze, and of the delicate tracery of that work? Did not the great\n                Scipio, that most learned and accomplished mall, under stand it too? But do you, a\n                man without one single virtue, without education, without natural ability, and\n                without any information, understand them and value them?

There is a shrine of\n                 among the Catenans of the same holy\n                nature as the one at home, and worshipped as the goddess is worshipped among foreign\n                nations, and in almost every country in the world. In the inmost part of that shrine\n                there was an extremely ancient statue of , as to which men were not only ignorant of what sort it was,\n                but even of its existence. For the entrance into that shrine does not belong to men,\n                the sacred ceremonies are accustomed to be performed by women and virgins. Verres's\n                slaves stole this statue by night out of that most holy and most ancient temple. The\n                next day the priestesses of , and the\n                female attendants of that temple, women of great age, noble and of proved virtue,\n                report the affair to their magistrates. It appeared to all a most bitter, and\n                scandalous, and miserable business.  Then that\n                man, influenced by the atrocity of the action, in order that all suspicion of that\n                crime might be removed from himself, employs some one connected with him by ties of\n                hospitality to find a man whom he might accuse of having done it, and bids him take\n                care that he be convicted of the accusation, so that he himself might not be subject\n                to the charge. The matter is not delayed. For when he had departed from , an information is laid against a certain\n                slave. He is accused; false witnesses are suborned against him; the whole senate\n                sits in judgment on the affair, according to the laws of the Catenans. The\n                priestesses are summoned; they are examined secretly in the senate-house, and asked\n                what had been done, and how they thought that the statue had been carried off. They\n                answer that the servants of the praetor had been seen in the temple. The matter,\n                which previously had not been very obscure, began to be clear enough by the evidence\n                of the priestesses. The judges deliberate; the innocent slave is acquitted by every\n                vote, in order that you may the more easily be able to condemn this man by all your\n                votes.

Did you send slaves to that place to plunder a temple, where it was\n                not lawful for free citizens to go, not even for the purpose of praying? Did you not\n                hesitate to lay violent hands on those things from which the laws of religion\n                enjoined you to keep even your eyes? Although it was not even because you were\n                charmed by the eye that you were led into this wicked and nefarious conduct; for you\n                coveted what you had never seen. You took a violent fancy, I say, to that which you\n                had not previously beheld.

Oh! but you\n                had heard of it, I suppose, from some good man, from some good authority. How could\n                you have done that, when you could never have heard of it from any man at all? You\n                heard of it, therefore, from a woman; since men could not have seen it nor known of\n                it. What sort of woman do you think that she must have been, O judges? What a modest\n                woman must she have been to converse with Verres! What a pious woman, to show him a\n                plan for robbing a temple! But it is no great wonder if those sacred ceremonies\n                which are performed by the most extreme chastity of virgins and matrons were\n                violated by his adultery and profligacy."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "103", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "104", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "47", "@unit": "chapter"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7005730", "#text": "Melita"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7001242", "#text": "Africa"}], "#text": "What, then, are we to think?

There was besides an immense quantity of ivory, and many\n                ornaments, among which were some ivory victories of ancient workmanship, and wrought\n                with exquisite skill.  Not to dwell too long on\n                this, he took care to have all these things taken down and carried off at one swoop\n                by means of the slaves of the Venus whom he had sent thither for that purpose."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7005730", "#text": "Melita"}, "#text": "O ye immortal gods! what sort of man is it that I am accusing?

On the folding-doors were some subjects most\n                minutely executed in ivory; all these he caused to be taken out; he tore off and\n                took away a very tine head of the Gorgon with snakes for hair; and he showed, too,\n                that he was influenced not only by admiration for the workmanship, but by a desire\n                of money and gain; for he did not hesitate to take away also all the golden knobs\n                from these folding-doors, which were numerous and heavy; and it was not the\n                workmanship of these, but the weight which pleased him. And so he left the\n                folding-doors in such state, that, though they had formerly contributed greatly to\n                the ornament of the temple, they now seemed to have been made only for the purpose\n                of shutting it up.

First of all, the\n                senators cry out that their rights are being taken away; that their liberty is being\n                taken away. The people praise the senate and thank them.

But a very heightened\n                and pompous defence of him is put forward in reply to me, which I must consider very\n                carefully beforehand, O judges, how I am to resist. For his cause is stated in this\n                way; that by his valour, and by his singular vigilance exerted at a critical and\n                perilous time, the province of  was\n                preserved in safety from fugitive slaves, and from the dangers of war.  What am I to do, O judges? In what way am I to shape my\n                accusation? which way am I to turn? For to all my attacks the appellation of a\n                gallant general is opposed, as a wall of defence. I am acquainted with the\n                topic;I see how Hortensius is going to boast himself. He will dilate upon\n                the dangers of the war, the critical time of the republic, the scarcity of able\n                generals; and that he will entreat of you, he will even claim as a right belonging\n                to himself, that you do not suffer so great a general to be taken from the Roman\n                people through the evidence of the Sicilians; that you do not allow his glory as a\n                general to be overclouded by accusations of avarice.  I cannot dissemble my alarm, O judges; I am afraid that Caius Verres, on account\n                of this amazing warlike valour of his, may escape with impunity from the\n                consequences of all his actions. For it occurs to me, what great influence, what\n                exceeding authority, the oration of Marcus Antonius was supposed to have had at the\n                trial of Marcus Aquillius; who, as he was not only skillful as an orator, but bold\n                also, when he had nearly finished his speech, took hold of Marcus Aquillius and\n                placed him in the sight of every one, and tore his robe away from his chest, in\n                order that the Roman people and the judges might see his scars, all received in\n                front; and at the same time he enlarged a good deal on that wound which he had\n                received on his head from the general of the enemy; and worked up the men who were\n                to judge in the cause to such a pitch, that they were greatly afraid lest the man\n                whom fortune had saved from the weapons of the enemy, and who had not spared\n                himself, should appear to have been saved not to receive praise from the Roman\n                people, but to endure the cruelty of the judges. Now again this same plan and method\n                of defence is to be tried by the opposite party. \n                The same object is aimed at. He may be a thief, he may be a robber of temples, he\n                may he the very chief man in every sort of vice and criminality; but he is a gallant\n                general and a fortunate one, and he must be preserved for the critical emergencies\n                of the republic."}, {"milestone": {"@n": "5", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "I will not plead against you according to strict law; I will not urge that point,\n                which perhaps I ought to carry if I did, that as this trial is appointed to take\n                place according to a particular formula, the point that required to be proved by\n                you, is not what gallant exploits you may have performed in war, but how you have\n                kept your hands from other people's money,I will not, I say, urge this;\n                but I will ask, as I perceive you are desirous that I should, what has been your\n                conduct and what have been your great exploits in war."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003897", "#text": "Messana"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "6", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "3", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "What will you say?

Every access\n                to the island was not only difficult to, but was entirely cut off from men who had\n                no ships; so that it was more easy for those men, to whom you say that  was so near, to go to the shore of the ocean\n                than to Cape Pelorus.  But as for the contagious\n                nature to that servile war, why is it spoken of by you more than by all the rest of\n                the officers who were governors of the other provinces? Is it because before that\n                time there had been wars of runaway slaves in ? But that is the very cause why that province is now and has\n                been in the least danger.

What I am going to mention is an old story, and\n                one, probably, owing to the severity of the example, not unknown to any one of you.\n                They tell a story that Lucius Domitius was praetor in , and that an immense boar was brought to him; that he,\n                marveling at the size of the beast, asked who had killed it. When he was told that\n                it was such-an-one's shepherd, he ordered him to be summoned before him; that the\n                shepherd came eagerly to the praetor, expecting praise and reward; that Domitius\n                asked him how he had slain so huge a beast; that he answered With a\n                hunting spear; and that he was instantly crucified by order of the\n                praetor. This may, perhaps, appear harsh: I say nothing either way; all that I\n                understand from the story is, that Domitius preferred to appear cruel in punishing,\n                to seeming negligent in overlooking offences."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003850", "#text": "Lilybaeum"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "9", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "10", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "5", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "Therefore, while these were the established regulations of the province, Caius\n                Norbanus, a man neither very active nor very valiant, was at perfect ease, at the\n                very moment that all  was raging with\n                the servile war. For at that time \n                easily took care of itself, so that no war could possibly arise there. In truth, as\n                no two things are so closely united as the traders are with the Sicilians, by habit,\n                by interest, by reason, and by community of sentiment; and as the Sicilians have all\n                their affairs in such a state that it is most desirable for them to be at peace; and\n                as they are so attached to the sway of the Roman people that they would be very\n                sorry that its power should be diminished or altered; and as ever since the servile\n                war all such dangers as these have been provided for, both by the regulations of the\n                praetors, and by the discipline of the masters; there is no conceivable domestic\n                evil which can arise out of the province itself. \n                What then do you say?

In the district of Triocala, a place which the fugitive slaves\n                had occupied before, the family of a certain Sicilian called Leonidas was implicated\n                in suspicion of a conspiracy. Information of the matter was laid before Verres.\n                Immediately, as was natural, by his command, the men who had been named were\n                arrested and taken to . Their\n                master was summoned to appear, and after the case had been heard they were\n                condemned."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7003850", "#text": "Lilybaeum"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "11", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "6", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "12", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "What happened afterwards?

Still this is an utterly\n                unprecedented step, and of such a character as to appear credible rather from\n                consideration of who the criminal is, than from consideration of the case itself\n                That a man should have released slaves; that that very man who had sentenced them\n                should release them; that he should release them, in a moment, out of the very jaws\n                of death, that he should release slaves convicted of a crime which affected the life\n                and existence of every free man  O\n                splendid general, not to be compared now to Marcus Aquillius, a most valiant man,\n                but to the Paulli, the Scipios, and the Marii! That a man should have had such\n                foresight at a time of such alarm and danger to the province! As he saw that the\n                minds of all the slaves in  were in\n                an unsettled state on account of the war of the runaway slaves in , what was the great terror he struck into them\n                to prevent any one's daring to stir? He ordered them to be arrestedwho\n                would not he alarmed? He ordered their masters to plead their causewhat\n                could be so terrible to slaves? He pronounced That they appeared to have\n                done.... He seems to have extinguished the rising flame by the pain and\n                death of a few. What follows next? Scourgings, and burnings, and all those extreme\n                agonies which are part of the punishment of condemned criminals, and which strike\n                terror into the rest, torture and the cross? From all these punishments they are\n                released. Who can doubt that he must have overwhelmed the minds of the slaves with\n                the most abject fear, when they saw a praetor so good-natured as to allow the lives\n                of men condemned of wickedness and conspiracy to be redeemed from punishment, the\n                very executioner acting as the go-between to negotiate the terms?"}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Apollonia", "#text": "Apollonia"}, {"@key": "tgn,7009120", "#text": "Leon"}, {"@key": "perseus,Megara", "#text": "Megara"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Panormus", "#text": "Panormus"}], "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "sesterces"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "16", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "17", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "8", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "18", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "What more?

While a war of slaves was dreaded, he released condemned slaves from the\n                same punishment which he inflicted on their masters who were not condemned.

He will say that the\n                affairs of the republic cannot be administered without terror and severity; he will\n                ask why the  are borne before the praetors, why\n                the axes are given to them, why prisons have been built, why so many punishments\n                have been established against the wicked by the usage of our ancestors. And when he\n                has said all this with becoming gravity and sternness, I will ask him why Verres all\n                of a sudden ordered this same Apollonius to be released from prison, without any\n                fresh circumstances having been brought to light, without any defence having been\n                made, or any trial having taken place? And I will affirm that there is so much\n                suspicion attached to this charge, that, without any arguments of mine, I will allow\n                the judges to form their own opinion as to what a system of plundering this was, how\n                infamous, how scandalous, and what an immense and boundless field it opens for\n                inordinate gain.  For first of all consider for a\n                moment how many and how grievous were the evils which that man inflicted on\n                Apollonius; and then calculate them and estimate them by money. You will find that\n                they were all so continued in the case of this one wealthy man, as by their example\n                to cause a fear of similar suffering and danger to all others. In the first place,\n                there was a sudden accusation of a capital and detestable crime; judge what you\n                think this worth, and how many have bought themselves off from such charges. In the\n                next place, there is an accusation without an accuser, a sentence without any bench\n                of judges, a condemnation without any defence having been made. Estimate the money\n                to be got by all these transactions, and then suppose that Apollonius alone was an\n                actual victim to these atrocities, but that all the rest, as many as they were,\n                delivered themselves from these sufferings by money. Lastly, there were darkness,\n                chains, imprisonment, punishment within the prison, seclusion from the sight of his\n                parents and of his children, a denial of the free air and common light of heaven;\n                but these things, which a man might freely give his life to escape, I am unable to\n                estimate by the standard of money.  From all these\n                things did Apollonius after a long time ransom himself, when he was worn out with\n                suffering and misery; but still he taught the rest to meet that man's wickedness and\n                avarice beforehand. Unless you think that a wealthy man was selected for so\n                incredible an accusation without any object of gain; or that, again, he was on a\n                sudden released from prison without any corresponding reason; or that this method of\n                plundering was used and tried in the case of that man alone, and that terror was\n                not, by means of his example, held out to and struck into every rich man in\n                  ."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "26", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "11", "@unit": "chapter"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}], "#text": "I wish, O judges, to be prompted by him, since I am speaking of his military\n                renown, if by accident I pass over anything.

You are in possession of the man's\n                wisdom, and diligence, and vigilance; and of his guardianship and defence of the\n                province.

In the first place, see how easy and pleasant to himself Verres\n                by his own ingenuity and wisdom made the labour of marches, which is a labour of the\n                greatest importance in all military affairs, and most especially necessary in\n                  . First, in the winter season he\n                devises for himself this admirable remedy against the severity of the cold and the\n                violence of storms and floods; he selected the city of , the situation of which and the nature\n                of its soil and atmosphere are said to be such that there never yet was a day of\n                such violent and turbulent storms, that men could not see the sun at some time or\n                other in the day. Here that gallant general was quartered in the winter months, so\n                securely that it was not easy to see him, I will not say out of the house, but even\n                out of bed. So the shortness of the day was consumed in banquets, the length of the\n                night in adulteries and debaucheries.  But when it\n                began to be spring, the beginning of which he was not used to date from the west\n                wind, or from any star, but he thought that spring was beginning when he had seen\n                the rose, then he devoted himself to labour and to marches; and in these he proved\n                himself so patient and active that no one ever once saw him sitting on a horse."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7016608", "#text": "Bithynia"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Cannae", "#text": "Cannae"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "28", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "12", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "29", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "For, as was the custom of the kings of , he was borne on a litter carried by eight men, in which was\n                a cushion, very beautiful, of Melitan manufacture, stuffed with roses.

Thither came the magistrates of the Sicilians,\n                thither came the Roman knights, as you have heard many of them state on their oaths;\n                there disputes were secretly communicated to him; and from thence, a little while\n                afterwards, decrees were openly brought down. Then, when for a while he had\n                dispensed the laws for bribery, and not out of considerations of justice, he thought\n                that now the rest of his time was due to Venus and to Bacchus.  And when speaking of this, I must not omit the admirable and\n                singular diligence of this great general. For know that there is no town in all\n                   of those in which the praetors are\n                accustomed to stay and hold their court, in which there was not some woman selected\n                for him out of some respectable family, to gratify his lust. Some of them were even\n                openly present at his banquets. If there were some a little modest, they used to\n                come at the proper time, and avoided the light of day, and the crowd. And these\n                banquets were celebrated, not with the orderly silence of the banquets of praetors\n                and generals of the Roman people, nor with that modesty which is usually found at\n                the entertainments of magistrates, but with the most excessive noise and licence of\n                conversation sometimes even affairs proceeded to blows and fighting.

That first campaign of his shall be brought up again, in\n                which he was, as he says himself, subservient to others, not their master.

One of them is, that it was so notorious to every one, that during the\n                consulship of Lucius Lucullus and Marcus Cotta, no one ever came up from any\n                municipal town to  on any law\n                business, who was so ill-informed of what was going on as not to know that all the\n                laws of the Roman people were regulated by the will and pleasure of Chelidon the\n                prostitute. The other is that, after he had left the city in the robe of\n                war,after he had pronounced the solemn vows for the success of his\n                administration, and for the common welfare of the republic, he was accustomed, for\n                the sake of committing adultery, to be brought back into the city, at night, in a\n                litter, to a woman who, though the wife of one man, was common to all men, contrary\n                to law, contrary to what was required by the auspices, contrary to everything which\n                is held sacred among gods and men."}, {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, "milestone": [{"@n": "36", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "37", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "15", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "38", "@unit": "section"}], "persName": [{"surname": "Ceres"}, {"surname": "Jupiter"}], "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "toga\n                  praetexta"}, "#text": "O ye immortal gods! what a difference is there between the minds and ideas of men!\n                So may your good opinion and that of the Roman people approve of my intentions, and\n                sanction my hopes for the rest of my life, as I have received those offices with\n                which the Roman people has as yet entrusted me with the feeling that I was bound to\n                a conscientious discharge of every possible duty.

But, however, I\n                give up and grant the whole of this, if you say that the vessel was built with your\n                money.

For Heius, the chief man of the city,the chief man of\n                that deputation which was sent to utter a panegyric on you, said that the ship had\n                been built for you by the public labour of the Mamertines, and that a Mamertine\n                Senator had been appointed by public authority to superintend the building of it.\n                The only thing that remains is the materials. And this you yourself compelled the\n                Rhegians to furnish at the public expense, as they say themselves (not that you can\n                deny it), because the Mamertines have no proper materials."}, {"milestone": {"@n": "48", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "If both the materials of which the vessel is built, and if those who built it, were\n                provided by your authority, not at your expense, what, then, is the secret thing\n                which you say was paid for with your money? Oh! but the Mamertines have no enemies\n                respecting it in their public accounts.  In the\n                first place, I can understand that it may be possible that they did not disburse any\n                money out of the treasury. In fact, even the Capitol, as it was built in the time of\n                our ancestors, was able to be built and completed by public authority, but without\n                any public payment, workmen being pressed into the service, and a fair quota of work\n                being exacted from each person respectively.

See the clemency, or rather the marvellous and unexampled\n                patience of the Roman people! Annius, a Roman knight, says that a Roman citizen was\n                put to death by the hand of the executioner. You say nothing.

You, who knew that\n                you should be accused, how did you know it? how came you ever to suspect it? You had\n                no enemy.

But if you were afraid of\n                this accusation,that some one might say that you had substituted some one\n                else, whom you had caused to be executed for the captain of the pirates, did you\n                think that it would be a stronger argument in your defence, to produce among\n                strangers a long time after, (because I required and compelled you to do so,) a man\n                who you said was the captain of the pirates; or to execute him, while the affair was\n                still of recent date, at ,\n                among people who knew him well, in the sight of almost all ?

Why, I\n                say, while the Roman citizens who were taken in the pirate's company were\n                immediately put to death, did you give the pirates themselves so long a lease of\n                life?

Now, when you produce\n                this man of yours, whoever he may be, still you see that you are laughed at. What\n                would you have done if he had escaped? if he had broken his bonds, as Nico, that\n                most celebrated pirate did, who was afterwards retaken by Publius Servilius, with\n                the same good fortune as he had originally taken him with; what would you have said\n                then?

For in the\n                height of summer, when all other praetors have been accustomed to visit all the\n                province, and to travel about, or to sail about,at a time when there was\n                such fear of and such danger from the pirates; at that time he was not content, for\n                the purpose of his luxury and lust, with his own kingly palace which had belonged to\n                king Hiero, and which the praetors are in the habit of using. He ordered, as I have\n                stated already, tents, such as he was wont to use at the summer season, erected of\n                fine linen curtains, to be pitched on the seashore; on that part of the shore which\n                is within the island of ,\n                behind the fountain of Arethusa; close to the entrance and mouth of the harbour, in\n                a very pleasant situation, and one far enough removed from overlookers.  Here the praetor of the Roman people, the guardian and\n                defender of the province, lived for sixty days of the summer in such a style that he\n                had banquets of women every day, while no man was admitted except himself and his\n                youthful son. Although, indeed, I might have made no exception, but might have said\n                that there was no man there at all, as there were only these two. Sometimes also his\n                freedman Timarchides was admitted. But the women were all wives of citizens, of\n                noble birth, except one the daughter of an actor named Isidorus, whom he, out of\n                love, had seduced away from a Rhodian flute player. There was a woman called Pippa,\n                the wife of Aeschrio the Syracusan, concerning which woman many verses, which were\n                made on Verres's fondness for her, are quoted over all .  There was a woman too,\n                called Nice, with a very beautiful face, as it is said, the wife of Cleomenes the\n                Syracusan. Cleomenes, her husband, was greatly attached to her, but still he had\n                neither the power nor the courage to oppose the lust of the praetor; and at the same\n                time he was bound to him by many presents and many good offices. But at that time\n                Verres, though you well know how great his impudence is, still could not, as her\n                husband was at , be quite easy\n                in his mind at keeping her with him so many days on the seashore. Accordingly, he\n                contrives a very singular plan. He gives the command of the fleet, which his\n                lieutenant had had, to Cleomenes. He orders Cleomenes, a Syracusan, to command a\n                fleet of the Roman people. He does this, in order that he might not only be absent\n                from home all the time that he was at sea, but that he might be so willingly, being\n                placed in a post of great honour and profit; and that he himself in the meantime,\n                the husband being sent away to a distance, might have her with him,I will\n                not say more easily than before, for who ever opposed his lust? but with a rather\n                more tranquil mind, as he had got rid of him, not as a husband but as a\n                rival.Cleomenes, a Syracusan, takes the command of a fleet of our allies\n                and friends."}, {"foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "denarii"}, "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}, {"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "84", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "85", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "33", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "86", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "What topic of accusation or complaint shall I urge first, O judges?

But our fleet was in the harbour of Pachynum. But Cleomenes,\n                because there was a garrison of troops (in name, if not in reality) in that place,\n                fancied that, with the soldiers he drew from thence, he might make up his proper\n                complement of sailors and rowers. The same system was found to nave been put in\n                practice by that most covetous man with respect to the troops, that had been adopted\n                towards the fleet, for only a few remained, and the rest had been discharged.\n                   Cleomenes, as commander-in-chief, in a\n                Centuripan quadrireme ordered the mast to be erected, the sails to be set, the\n                anchor to be weighed, and made signal for the rest of the ships to follow him. This\n                Centuripan vessel was an extraordinarily fast sailer; for, while Verres was praetor,\n                no one had any opportunity of knowing what each ship could do with oars; although in\n                order to do honour and to show favour to Cleomenes, there was a much smaller\n                deficiency of rowers and soldiers in that quadrireme. The quadrireme, almost flying,\n                had already got out of sight, while the other ships were still hard at work in their\n                original station.

And if Cleomenes had not run away so long before, there would have been some\n                means of making resistance, for that ship was the only one with a deck, and was\n                large enough to have been a bulwark to the rest, and if it had been engaged in\n                battle with the pirates, it would have looked like a city among those piratical\n                galleys; but at that time the sailors being helpless, and deserted by their\n                commander and prefect of the fleet, began of necessity to hold the same course that\n                he had held.

The situation of the place is such that the\n                Syracusans usually saw their enemies armed and victorious within their walls, in the\n                city, and in the forum, before they saw any enemy's ship in their harbour.\n                   Here, while you were praetor, galleys of\n                pirates sailed about, where previously the only fleet that had ever entered in the\n                history of the world, was the Athenian fleet of three hundred ships, which forced\n                its way in by its weight and its numbers; and that fleet was in that very harbour\n                defeated and destroyed, owing to the natural character of the place and harbour.\n                Here first was the power of that splendid city defeated, weakened, and impaired.

Know then that the case of\n                Heraclius was this:that on account of a severe complaint in his eyes he\n                had not gone to sea at all; but by his order who had the command, he had remained in\n                his quarters at .

But he was in just the\n                same condition as if he had been detected in some manifest crime; though no charge\n                at all could be brought against him, not ever so falsely.  Among these naval captains was a citizen of Heraclia, of the name\n                of Junius, (for they have some Latin names of that sort,) a man, as long as he\n                lived, illustrious in his own city, and after his death celebrated over all\n                  . In that man there was courage\n                enough, not only to attack Verres, for that indeed, as he saw that he was sure to\n                die, he was aware that he could do without any danger; but when his death was\n                settled, while his mother was sitting in his prison, night and day weeping, he wrote\n                out the defence which his cause required; and now there is no one in all  who is not in possession of that defence, who\n                does not read it, who is not constantly reminded by that oration, of your wickedness\n                and cruelty. In it he states how many sailors he received from his city; how many\n                Verres discharged, and for how much he discharged each of them; how many he had\n                left. He makes similar statements with respect to the other ships and when he\n                uttered these statements before you, he was scourged on the eyes. But when death was\n                staring him in the face, he could easily endure pain of body; he cried out, what he\n                has left also in writing, That it was an infamous thing that the tears of\n                an unchaste woman on behalf of the safety of Cleomenes should have more influence\n                with you, than those of his mother for his life.

To make my story short, you\n                heard the young man himself say, that because of his fear of being scourged he paid\n                money to Timarchides.  These are but light crimes\n                in such a criminal as this.

These very fathers, whom you see\n                here, lay on the threshold, and the wretched mothers spent their nights at the door\n                of the prison, denied the parting embrace of their children, though they prayed for\n                nothing but to be allowed to receive their son's dying breath.

You heard Onasus the Segestan, a man of noble birth, say that he\n                had paid money to Timarchides for leave to bury the naval captain, Heraclius.

And as to this, who was there at  at that time, who did not hear, and who does not know that\n                these bargains for permission to bury were made with Timarchides by the living\n                relations of those who had been put to death? Did they not speak openly with\n                Timarchides? Were not all the relations of all the men present? Were not the\n                funerals of living men openly bargained for?

They were not\n                aware that those very things which they thought that they were employing as aids to\n                ensure their safety, were the causes of their danger.

Have all our rights fallen so far, that in a\n                province of the Roman people,in a town of our confederate\n                allies,a Roman citizen should be bound in the forum, and beaten with rods\n                by a man who only had the fasces and the axes through the kindness of the Roman\n                people? What shall I say? When fire, and red-hot plates and other instruments of\n                torture were employed? It the bitter entreaties and the miserable cries of that man\n                had no power to restrain you, were you not moved even by the weeping and loud groans\n                of the Roman citizens who were present at that time? Did you dare to drag any one to\n                the cross who said that he was a Roman citizen? I was unwilling, O judges, to press\n                this point so strongly at the former pleading; I was unwilling to do so. For you saw\n                how the feelings of the multitude were excited against him with indignation, and\n                hatred, and fear of their common danger. I, at that time, fixed a limit to my\n                oration, and checked the eagerness of Caius Numitorius a Roman knight, a man of the\n                highest character, one of my witnesses. And I rejoiced that Glabrio had acted (and\n                he had acted most wisely) as he did in dismissing that witness immediately, in the\n                middle of the discussion. In fact he was afraid that the Roman people might seem to\n                have inflicted that punishment on Verres by tumultuary violence, which he was\n                anxious he should only suffer according to the laws and by your judicial sentence.\n                   Now since it is made clear beyond a doubt to\n                every one, in what state your case is, and what will become of you, I will deal thus\n                with you: I will prove that that Gavius whom you all of a sudden assert to have been\n                a spy, had been confined by you in the stone-quarries at ; and I will prove that, not only by\n                the registers of the Syracusans,lest you should be able to say that,\n                because there is a man named Gavius mentioned in those documents, I have invented\n                this charge, and picked out this name so as to be able to say that this is the\n                man,but in accordance with your own choice I will produce witnesses, who\n                will state that that identical man was thrown by you into the stone-quarries at\n                  . I will produce, also,\n                citizens of , his fellow citizens and\n                relations,, who shall teach you, though it is too late, and who shall also teach the\n                judges, (for it is not too late for them to know them,) that that Publius Gavius\n                whom you crucified was a Roman citizen, and a citizen of the municipality of\n                  , not a spy of runaway slaves."}, {"placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Tauromenium", "#text": "Tauromenium"}, {"@key": "tgn,7004296", "#text": "Rhegium"}, {"@key": "tgn,7000198", "#text": "India"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "166", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "65", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "167", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "When I have made all these points, which I undertake to prove, abundantly plain to\n                your most intimate friends, then I will also turn my attention to that which is\n                granted me by you. I will say that I am content with that. For whatwhat,\n                I saydid you yourself lately say, when in an agitated state you escaped\n                from the outcry and violence of the Roman people?

And you, O Verres, say\n                the same thing. You confess that he did cry out that he was a Roman citizen; but\n                that the name of citizenship did not avail with you even as much as to cause the\n                least hesitation in your mind, or even any brief respite from a most cruel and\n                ignominious punishment.

I do not ask you what were your grounds for that suspicion, I impeach you by\n                your own words. He said that he was a Roman citizen. If you, O Verres, being taken\n                among the Persians or in the remotest parts of , were being led to execution, what else would you cry out but\n                that you were a Roman citizen?

A little while ago, O judges, we did not restrain our\n                tears at the miserable and most unworthy death of the naval captains; and it was\n                right for us to be moved at the misery of our innocent allies; what now ought we to\n                do when the lives of our relations are concerned?

All the Roman citizens in this place, both those who\n                are present, and those who are absent in distant lands, require your severity,\n                implore the aid of your good faith, look anxiously for your assistance. They think\n                that all their privileges, all their advantages, all their defences, in short their\n                whole liberty, depends on your sentence.  From\n                me, although they have already had aid enough, still, if the affair should turn out\n                ill, they will perhaps have more than the venture to ask for.

As to other things, if you think that you can\n                secretly manage, out of court, some of the things which belong to this judicial\n                trial; if you think that you can effect anything by artifice, by cunning, by\n                influence, by your own popularity, by that man's wealth; then I am strongly of\n                opinion you had better abandon that idea. And I warn you rather to put down, I warn\n                you not to suffer to proceed any further the attempts which have already been\n                commenced by that man, but which have been thoroughly detected by, and are\n                thoroughly known to me. It will be at a great risk to yourself that any error is\n                committed in this trial; at a greater risk than you think.  For as for your thinking yourself now relieved from all fear for\n                your reputation, and at the summit of all honour as consul elect, believe me, it is\n                no less laborious a task to preserve those honours and kindnesses, conferred on you\n                by the Roman people, than to acquire them. This city has borne as long as it could,\n                as long as there was no help for it, that kingly sort of sway of yours which you\n                have exercised in the courts of justice, and in every part of the republic. It has\n                borne it, I say.

And in the case of all of us, if any one of us turns\n                aside ever so little from the right path, there will follow, not that silent opinion\n                of men which you were formerly accustomed to despise, but a severe and fearless\n                judgment of the Roman people. You have, O Quintus, no relationship, no connection\n                with that man. In the case of this man you can have none of those excuses with which\n                you formerly used to defend your excessive zeal in any trial.

Will it be possible for me\n                either to lay this burden on the shoulders of this tribunal, or any longer to endure\n                it in silence? Must not the matter be agitated? must it not be brought publicly\n                forward? Must not the good faith of the Roman people be implored?

Perhaps some one\n                will ask, Are you then going to take upon yourself such a labour, and such violent\n                enmity from so many quarters? Not, of a truth, from any desire of mine, or of my own\n                free will. But I have not the same liberty allowed me that they have who are born of\n                noble family; on whom even when they are asleep all the honours of the Roman people\n                are showered. I must live in this city on far other terms and other conditions. For\n                the case of Marcus Cato, a most wise and active man, occurs to me; who, as he\n                thought that it was better to be recommended to the Roman people by virtue than by\n                high birth, and as he wished that the foundation of his race and name should be hid\n                and extended by himself, voluntarily encountered the enmity of most influential men,\n                and lived in the discharge of the greatest labours to an extreme old age with great\n                credit.  After that, did not Quintus Pompeius, a\n                man born in a low and obscure rank of life, gain the very highest honours by\n                encountering the enmity of many, and great personal danger, and by undertaking great\n                labour? And lately we have seen Caius Fimbria, Caius Marcius, and Caius Caelius,\n                striving with no slight toil, and in spite of no insignificant opposition, to arrive\n                at those honours which you nobles arrive at while devoted to amusement or absorbed\n                in indifference. This is the system, this is the path for our adoption. These are\n                the men whose conduct and principles we follow."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "182", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "183", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "72", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "184", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "We see how unpopular with, and how hateful to some men of noble birth, is the\n                virtue and industry of new men; that, if we only turn our eyes away for a moment,\n                snares are laid for us; that, if we give the least room for suspicion or for\n                accusation, an attack is immediately made on us; that we must be always vigilant,\n                always labouring.

In\n                truth, silent and secret enmities are more to be dreaded than war openly declared\n                and waged against us.

Wherefore, O\n                judges, I earnestly wish that I may appear for the last time in the character of an\n                accuser, in the case of this criminal, when I shall have given satisfaction to the\n                Roman people, and discharged the duty due to the Sicilians my client, and which I\n                have voluntarily undertaken.

Moreover, if there be any persons, who in\n                the case of the criminal have any inclination to show themselves powerful, or\n                audacious, or ingenious in corrupting the tribunal, let them hold themselves ready,\n                seeing that they will have to fight a battle with us, while the Roman people will be\n                the judges of the contest. And if they know that, in the case of this criminal, whom\n                the Sicilian nation has given me for my enemy, I have been sufficiently energetic,\n                sufficiently persevering, and sufficiently vigilant, they may conceive that I shall\n                be a much more formidable and active enemy to those men whose enmity I have\n                encountered of my own accord, for the sake of the Roman people."}, {"persName": [{"surname": "Jupiter"}, {"surname": "Latona"}, {"surname": "Ceres"}, {"surname": "Ceres"}, {"surname": "Ceres"}, {"surname": "Ceres"}], "placeName": [{"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}, {"@key": "tgn,7005730", "#text": "Melita"}, {"@key": "perseus,Athens", "#text": "Athens"}, {"@key": "perseus,Syracuse", "#text": "Syracuse"}, {"@key": "tgn,7011273", "#text": "Delos"}, {"@key": "tgn,7002670", "#text": "Chios"}, {"@key": "perseus,Segesta", "#text": "Segesta"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003947", "#text": "Catina"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003916", "#text": "Enna"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003916", "#text": "Enna"}, {"@key": "tgn,7003122", "#text": "Sicily"}], "milestone": [{"@n": "185", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "186", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "187", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "188", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "189", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Now, O good and great , you, whose\n                royal present, worthy of your most splendid temple, worthy of the Capitol and of\n                that citadel of all nations, worthy of being the gift of a king, made for you by a\n                king, dedicated and promised to you, that man by his nefarious wickedness wrested\n                from the hands of a monarch;
