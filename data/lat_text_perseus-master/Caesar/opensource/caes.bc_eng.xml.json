We have not only the express testimony of\n                        Suetonius to the contrary, but the very style sufficiently declares, that\n                        Caesar alone could be the author of the work. There is room however to\n                        suspect, from the abrupt manner in which the subject is introduced, that the\n                        beginning of this first book is wanting: for history takes notice of several\n                        previous facts, of which no mention is made here. I have therefore collected\n                        out of Plutarch, Appian, and , as much as was necessary to connect\n                        this and the former Commentary, and fancy it will not be disagreeable to the\n                        reader, to offer it here by way of preface.  being wholly reduced, Caesar, upon\n                        his arrival in , thought proper, for many\n                        reasons, to send deputies to , to demand the consulship, and a\n                        prolongation of his command. Pompey, who, though averse to Caesar's\n                        interest, had not yet openly declared against him, neither furthered nor\n                        opposed his request. But the consuls Marcellus and Lentulus, who had already\n                        joined the party of his enemies, resolved by every method in their power to\n                        frustrate the design. Marcellus scrupled not to add other injuries to that\n                        of which we speak. For Caesar had lately planted a colony at Novocomum in\n                        Cisalpine Gaul; and Marcellus, not satisfied with stripping the inhabitants\n                        of the privilege of Roman citizens, seized one of their chief magistrates at , ordered him to be scourged, and\n                        then dismissed him to carry his complaints to Caesar, an ignominy from which\n                        all free citizens were expressly exempted by the laws. While affairs were in\n                        this train, C. Curio, tribune of the people, came to Caesar in . This nobleman, after many attempts\n                        in behalf of the commonwealth, and to promote Caesar's interest; finding at\n                        length all his endeavours without effect, fled from , to avoid the malice of his enemies,\n                        and informed Caesar of all that was transacted against him. Caesar received\n                        him with great marks of respect, as well on account of his rank in the\n                        commonwealth, as the many services he had done himself and the state; and\n                        thanked him for the signal zeal he had shown in his cause. But Curio advised\n                        him, since his enemies were now openly preparing for war, to draw his army\n                        together without delay, and rescue the commonwealth from the tyranny of an\n                        aspiring faction. Caesar, though fully satisfied of the truth of Curio's\n                        report, resolved to sacrifice all other considerations to the public\n                        tranquillity, that no man might justly charge him with being the author of a\n                        civil war. He therefore only petitioned by his friends, that the government\n                        of Cisalpine Gaul and , with the command of two\n                        legions, might be continued to him, in all which his principal aim was, by\n                        the equity of his demands, to induce his enemies to grant peace to the\n                        commonwealth. These offers appeared so reasonable, that even Pompey himself\n                        knew not how to oppose them. But the consuls still continuing inflexible,\n                        Caesar wrote a letter to the senate, wherein, after briefly enumerating his\n                        exploits and services, he requested them not to deprive him of the benefit\n                        of the people's favour, who had permitted him to sue for the consulship in\n                        his absence. He protested his readiness, if such was the resolution of the\n                        senate and people of , to dismiss his army, provided\n                        Pompey did the same: but could by no means resolve, so long as he continued\n                        in command and authority, to divest himself of troops, and lay himself open\n                        to the injuries of his enemies. Curio was commissoned to carry this letter,\n                        who travelling with incredible despatch, reached  in three days (a distance of a\n                        hundred and sixty miles,) before the beginning of January, and ere the\n                        consuls could get any thing determined relating to Caesar's command. Curio,\n                        upon his arrival, refused to part with the letter, resolving not to deliver\n                        it but in full senate, and when the tribunes of the people were present: for\n                        he was apprehensive, should he do otherwise, that the consuls would suppress\n                        it."}}, {"@n": "1", "@id": "b1c1", "@type": "chapter", "p": "Caesar's letter being delivered to the consuls, the tribunes, with much\n                        difficulty, procured it a reading in the senate; but could by no means\n                        prevail to have his demands brought under deliberation. The consuls proposed\n                        to debate upon the state of the republic. \" Lentulus promised to stand by\n                        the senate and the people, if they would deliver their sentiments with\n                        freedom and courage; but if they regarded Caesar, and affected to court his\n                        friendship, as had been the practice for some time past, he knew, he told\n                        them, what he had to do, and was determined to disclaim their authority; not\n                        doubting but he would find a ready admittance to the favour and protection\n                        of Caesar.\" Scipio spoke much to the same purpose: \"That Pompey was firmly\n                        bent not to abandon the republic, if he found the senators ready to support\n                        him; but if they cooled, or were remiss in their resolves, it would be in\n                        vain for them to expect his aid, if they saw cause afterwards to apply for\n                        it.\""}, {"@n": "2", "@id": "b1c2", "@type": "chapter", "p": {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,1000080", "#text": "Italy"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "perseus,Rome", "#text": "Rome"}], "#text": "This speech of Scipio, as the senate was held in the city, and Pompey\n                        resided in the suburbs, was considered as coming from Pompey's own mouth.\n                        Some were for following milder counsels, of which number was M. Marcellus,\n                        who gave it as his opinion: \"That it was not proper to enter upon the\n                        present deliberation, till troops were raised over all , and an army got ready, under whose\n                        protection the senate might proceed with freedom and safety in their\n                        debates.\" \" Callidius was for sending Pompey to his government, to take away\n                        all occasion of discord; because Caesar had reason to fear, as two of his\n                        legions had been taken from him, that Pompey retained them in the\n                        neighbourhood of , with a view to employ them against\n                        him.\" M. Rufus nearly agreed with Callidius. But they were all severely\n                        reprimanded by the consul Lentulus, who expressly refused to put Callidius's\n                        motion to the vote. Marcellus, awed by the consul's reprimand, retracted\n                        what he had said. Thus the clamours of Lentulus, the dread of an army at the\n                        gates of , and the menaces of Pompey's\n                        friends, forced the greater part of the senate, though with the utmost\n                        reluctance and dislike, into a compliance with Scipio's motion: \" That\n                        Caesar should be ordered to disband his army before a certain day then\n                        fixed; and that in case of disobedience, he should be declared an enemy to\n                        the republic.\" M.

Thus all orders had shown an inclination to treat, while Afranius\n                        and Petreius alone opposed an accommodation, refusing both interview and\n                        truce, and barbarously murdering those whom the faith of a conference had\n                        enticed to their camp: that it had therefore happened to them, as frequently\n                        happens to men of obstinacy and arrogance, and they were forced to have\n                        recourse to those conditions, and earnestly solicit the very same terms,\n                        which not long before they had despised.

All which, nevertheless, he had hitherto borne, and\n                        still resolved to bear with patience; nor was it now his design, to take\n                        from them their soldiers, and enlist them, as it would be easy for him to\n                        do, but to prevent their employing them against him. Therefore, as he had\n                        already intimated, they must resolve to quit , and disband their forces, in which\n                        case he would injure no man.

Caesar, perceiving that his men were wounded from all\n                        sides, resolved to quit the place and retire.

Pompey went so far as to\n                        say, That he consented to be accounted a general of no merit, if Caesar's\n                        men got off without considerable loss."}, {"@n": "46", "@id": "b3c46", "@type": "chapter", "p": "Caesar, concerned about the retreat of his men, ordered hurdles to be fixed\n                        on the ridge of the hill fronting the enemy: behind which he dug a moderate\n                        ditch, and rendered the place as inaccessible as he could, on all sides.\n                        When this was done, he began to file off the legionary soldiers, supporting\n                        them by some light-armed troops, posted on their flanks, who, with arrows\n                        and stones, might repulse the enemy.
