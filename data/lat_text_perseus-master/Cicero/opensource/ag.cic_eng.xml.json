Pompey, who on his return from the East had been   unfairly treated by the extreme senatorial party, allied himself with the democratic leaders, Caesar and Crassus, in a coalition often called the First Triumvirate. As a result, the Senate became for a time almost powerless, and everything was in the hands of the popular party. The next year, Caesar, as consul, procured the passage of an iniquitous law for dividing the fertile and populous territory of Campania among needy citizens of Rome. Cicero refused to serve on the board appointed to execute this law. Thus he not only exasperated the mob, but brought down upon himself the resentment of the triumvirs,who, though two of them, Caesar and Pompey, still professed to be his personal friends, refused to protect him against the attacks of his enemies. Accordingly, in , Clodius, then tribune,  brought forward a law that whoever had put to death a Roman citizen, without trial, \"should be denied the use of fire and water\" (the Roman formula for banishment). This bill was obviously aimed at Cicero's action in the case of the Catilinarians. Cicero at once took alarm, and after appealing in vain to the consuls of the year, L. Calpurnius Piso and A. Gabinius, as well as to Pompey, left Rome about March 20, just as the affair was coming to blows. Immediately after his departure, Clodius procured the passage of a special bill against him, forbidding him, by name, the use of fire or water anywhere within four hundred miles of Rome. At the same time his house on the Palatine  and his Tusculan  villa were pillaged and destroyed by a mob. Upon receiving news of these proceedings, Cicero prepared to leave Italy altogether.

Hence every ambitious Roman, of high or low estate, had to become a politician and follow the regular course of office-holding. The curule magistrates were at once generals, judges, and statesmen. To achieve success, therefore, a politician had to show ability in all of these directions. Occasionally, to be sure, a man succeeded by virtue of a single talent,like Marius, who owed his advancement solely to his valor and military skill; but such instances were rare. Next to military fame, the strongest recommendation to the favor of the people was oratorical ability. Then, as now, the orator's power to move the multitude in public affairs was the readiest means of advancement. Further, political prosecutions, and private suits prompted by political motives, were of the commonest occurrence, and these afforded an eloquent advocate abundant opportunity to make himself known and to secure the favor of large bodies of supporters. Again, the Senate was a numerous and somewhat turbulent body, always more or less divided in a partisan sense; and, though it had no legislative functions, it still exercised a very strong influence on politics.

By reason of the disturbed condition of Italy, from the revolt of Spartacus, he was not relieved at the end of a year, as the law required, but continued two years longer in the government of the province, when he was succeeded by Lucius Caecilius Metellus. During these three years he was guilty of the most abominable oppressions and exactions; and the Sicilians, as soon as they were relieved of his presence, brought suit against him in the court of Repetundae (that for the trial of cases of Extortion), then presided over by the praetor Manius Acilius Glabrio. To conduct the prosecution they had recourse to Cicero, who already stood high among Roman advocates, and who was personally known and trusted by the Sicilians on account of his honorable administration of the quaestorship in their island in .

The only hope of Verres lay in preventing a fair and speedy trial. First he tried to obtain a prosecutor who should be in collusion with him, and would not push him too hard. For this purpose one Caecilius was put forward, an insignificant person, but a native of Sicily. Cicero's first speech in the case () was therefore a preliminary argument before the praetor Glabrio in person, to show that he, rather than Caecilius, should be allowed to conduct the case.

This intrigue was foiled by Cicero's industry and skill. He used not quite half of the time allowed him, arriving in Rome, with ample evidence, not only before the prosecutor in the rival case was ready, but even before the latter had left Italy on his pretended tour of investigation.

In these elections Cicero was designated aedile; but his rival Hortensius was chosen consul, with Quintus Metellus Creticus, Verres' fast friend, as his colleague. More than this, Marcus Metellus, brother of Quintus, was chosen praetor, and the lot fell to him to preside the next year in the court of Repetundae. If now the trial could be put over till the next year, when Hortensius and the two Metelli would be in the three most influential positions in the  State, Verres felt quite sure of getting clear. Neither did it seem as if this would be very hard to bring about; for the last six months of the Roman year were so full of festivals and other days on which the court could not sit, that the case would be liable to constant interruptions and delays.

It was customary for the prosecutor, after opening the case (as in the present speech), to present his proofs and arguments in a long connected oration (or a series of orations); there followed a reply from the defendant's counsel, and then the witnesses were introduced. Cicero, omitting the long statement just described, proceeded to bring forward his witnesses immediately. Since the only hope of the defence lay in putting off the trial, Cicero's promptitude was decisive: Hortensius soon threw up his case, and Verres went into exile, with a name forever associated with extortion and misgovernment. Full restitution of the plunder was, however, not obtained: a compromise was made, by which a less sum was paid in satisfaction of the claims. The five speeches known as the \"Accusation\" proper () were never delivered, but were written out and published in order to put on record the facts which Cicero had gathered with so much pains, and to give a specimen of his powers in the way of forensic composition."}, "With the trial of Verres the student may compare the impeachment of Warren Hastings in the eighteenth century, probably the most famous modern instance of the arraignment of a provincial governor for alleged misgovernment, extortion, and cruelty. The prosecution in this case (and in particular Burke) seem to have modelled their speeches on the Verrine orations of Cicero, and many parallels may easily be discovered A few of these are quoted in these notes. That the similarity of the two situations was clearly felt at the time may be seen from Lord Erskine's Defence of Stockdale (December, 1789) on a charge connected with the impeachment of Hastings: When Cicero impeached Verres before the great tribunal of Rome, of similar cruelties and depredations in her provinces, the Roman people were not left to such inquiries. All Sicily surrounded the Forum, demanding justice upon her plunderer and spoiler, with tears and imprecations. It was not by the eloquence of the orator, but by the cries and tears of the miserable, that Cicero prevailed in that illustrious case.

Annius Milo was a young man of good family and a recognized leader, on the aristocratic side, in the turbulent politics of the time during the absence of Caesar in Gaul and following the disastrous campaign of Crassus in the East. His bitterest opponent was P. Clodius, the leader of the popular party, a man of high birth and versatile talents, but of infamous life, and an unscrupulous partisan. Both sides depended to a great extent on organized violence. On the one side was the city mob, headed by Clodius. On the other, Milo maintained a band of professional bullies and prize-fighters ()."}, {"date": "B.C. 53", "#text": "Under these two leaders, the old political strife, always attended with some violence, became almost a succession of riots. The disorders were so great that the year  was half over before the consuls, who should have been chosen six months before the beginning of the year, could be elected. When finally, in July, 53, Cn. Domitius Calvinus and M. Valerius Messala were chosen, the campaign for the following  year began at once. Milo was a candidate for the consulship, and Clodius for the praetorship. Riots were of almost daily occurrence, and no elections could be held. The year 52 began without either consuls or praetors in office, and it became obvious that peace could be restored only by the death of either Clodius or Milo. The latter was a candidate for the consulship, but his election had been successfully resisted by Clodius. On the 18th of January the quarrel came to a bloody crisis. Milo had set out from Rome, towards nightfall, with a large retinue, including his troop of armed guards, for Lanuvium, a village about twenty miles SE. of Rome, where he held an office of some local dignity. He was met on the Appian Way, a few miles out, by Clodius, who was returning to the city from one of his estates on horseback, with thirty armed attendants. As they passed each other, their followers came to blows. Clodius was wounded, and driven into a shop or tavern by the wayside. Milo, unwilling to leave so dangerous an enemy alive, followed him up; and Clodius, with a dozen others, among them the owner of the tavern, was killed. The meeting was probably accidental on both sides; but each had openly threatened the other's life, and hence each party loudly accused the other of premeditated assault and actual or intended murder. Anarchy broke loose in Rome. The funeral of Clodius was an occasion of riot and conflagration. Other disorders followed. Quiet was only restored by the appointment of Pompey as \"consul without colleague\" (practically dictator), and for about six months the city was held by him under a sort of martial law. A special court was established for the trial of all cases arising out of the brawl in the Appian Way. The arraignment of Milo before this court on the charge of assault and homicide took place about the 10th of April. Cicero undertook his defence both from political motives and from personal regard. By Pompey's orders the court was surrounded by armed troops (a strange sight at that time in Rome) to protect it from the violence of the mob which raged outside. Cicero, whose nerves were shaken by the uproar, lost his self-command, and spoke \"not with his usual firmness.\" Milo was condemned by thirty-eight votes out of fifty-one, and went into exile at Marseilles. Cicero, dissatisfied with the speech actually delivered, as taken down by short-hand, wrote out at his leisure the masterpiece of eloquence and specious argument which follows."}], "div2": [{"@type": "overv", "@n": "1-6", "head": "I.

Attius Varus. In this capacity it had fallen to him to prevent the landing of L. Aelius Tubero, whom the Senate had sent to take command in Africa, but to whom Varus refused to give up the post. When the war was over, Caesar spared the life of Ligarius, but kept him in exile, until a personal application for his recall was made by his brother, T. Ligarius.

The conspirators fancied that if the dictator were out of the way the old constitution could be restored. But Caesar's victory had made a republic forever impossible. Nor had the conspirators made any arrangements for a permanent government, or even for their own safety. The sole question was, who should succeed to the supreme power of the murdered dictator. And the only persons who had any real claims were Caesar's surviving colleague in the consulship, Mark Antony, and the young Octavianus, Caesar's grand-nephew, adopted son, and heir (afterwards the emperor Augustus)."}, "Antony, who had come into possession of Caesar's papers and estates, caused his \"acts\" to be legally confirmed, seized the public funds, abolished the office of dictator, and secured as large a share of authority as he could. He was a man of inordinate ambition, controlled only by an equally unbounded self-indulgence, utterly without principle or scruple, and (if we may trust the character of him drawn by Cicero) a  monster of profligacy and crime. He had married for his third wife Fulvia, widow of Publius Clodius, and shared, with her, that tribune's vindictive hate of Cicero. His colleague was P. Cornelius Dolabella, Cicero's son-in-law, who had assumed the consulship at Caesar's death, on the ground that the latter had appointed him his successor in that office. Dolabella dallied with the conspirators, suppressed the violence of the mob that threatened them, and might have had some pretensions to the power, with the support of the aristocracy, but was easily out-generalled or bought off by Antony. Lepidus, who had a military command, and in whom the aristocracy had some hope, was also gained over by him. Octavianus, now twenty years old, hastened from Epirus to claim his inheritance and take part in the conflict which he saw approaching. He was a young man of precocious talent, of cool and wary temper, of ambition equal to Antony's, and of a political sagacity which, through his long life, seems never to have been at fault.", "Neither of the two chief claimants was strong enough alone to be quite independent of the other. At first, however, they stood in the attitude of rivals, and in their antagonism there seemed still some hope for the republic. Each endeavored to secure the countenance of the Senate and to gain control over the public armies; and each succeeded in attaching to himself a considerable force, though neither was strong enough to hold the capital against the other.", "Meanwhile Cicero, who at first hailed the death of Caesar as the restoration of the republic, lost courage, and set out in July for Greece. Detained, however, by contrary winds, and receiving more favorable news from Rome, he returned to the city at the end of August, to find that all his hopes were idle. Still, he made an effort at conciliation, in a speech in the Senate, on the 2d of September. In this he replied severely to an attack made upon him by Antony the day before, but still took pains to leave the door open for a restoration of good-will. It was to no purpose. Antony replied, September 19, with such bitterness directly charging Cicero with the murder of Clodius and of Caesar  that it was clear he meant there should be no alternative but civil war. Cicero did not venture to answer him in the Senate; but replied, ten weeks later, in a pamphlet  by many regarded as his masterpiece  as bitter and uncompromising as the consul's attack. From its likeness in tone to the famous invectives of Demosthenes against  Philip of Macedon, this was called a \"Phiippic\"; and the term has  been extended to the entire series of fourteen orations against Antony,  commencing with that of September 2, and ending with the triumphant  speech (given below) with which Cicero's political career closed.", {"date": "B.C. 43", "#text": "The winter was spent in attempts at negotiation, every stage illustrated by the running commentary of Cicero's Philippics. At last, in the spring of , diplomacy was at an end. Actual hostilities broke out first in Cisalpine Gaul, where Decimus Brutuswho had taken command of that province, according to Caesar's last willheld the town of Mutina (Modena) against Antony. Octavianus, with his independent force, had also ranged himself on the side of the Senate. The consuls of that year, Aulus Hirtius and C. Vibius Pansa, had, after some hesitation, vigorously taken up the same cause. In April the consuls met Antony in two battles,  on the 15th at Bononia (Bologna), on the 27th near Mutina. In both he was defeated; but in the first Pansa was mortally wounded, and in the second Hirtius was killed. It was on the reception of the news of the victory at Bononia, while Pansa's fate was unknown, that Cicero, in the Senate, delivered his fourteenth and last Philippic (April 22)."}, "The rejoicings were soon at an end. Octavianus found that his own interests were best served by uniting with Antony against the Senate. These two  with Lepidus as a third triumvir  came easily into possession of supreme power. A remorseless proscription followed, in which the most illustrious victim was Cicero, sacrificed to Antony's resentment, the vindictive hate of Fulvia, and the cold ingratitude of Octavianus.", "Of the fourteen Philippics, the Second is by far the most famous. It is a long and elaborate invective,  in some parts exceedingly bitter and coarse,  reviewing the domestic and political career of Mark Antony, and charging him with every personal vice and almost every public crime. In its allusions to the acts of Caesar, its hostility is uncompromising, vindictive, often scornful. The revival of the title \"perpetual dictator\" seems to have inspired Cicero with hatred, horror, and fear; and his real enmity was no longer disguised after Caesar's death.", "The Fourteenth Philippic has a unique interest as the last free voice of the Roman Senate, and from its ill-timed confidence in the future emperor. It is also interesting as an example of labored and stately panegyric, after the manner of the Greeks, on patriots fallen in battle, and from the formal resolution of thanks and honor with which it closes.
