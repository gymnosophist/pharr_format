                "0":" After the survival of the events of an\n unendurable campaign, when the spirits of both parties,\n broken by the variety of their dangers and hardships, were still drooping,\n before the blare of the trumpets had ceased or the soldiers been assigned to\n their winter quarters, the gusts of raging Fortune brought new storms upon the\n commonwealth through the misdeeds, many and notorious, of Gallus Caesar.\n \n He had been raised, at the very beginning of mature manhood,\n by an unexpected promotion from the utmost depths of wretchedness to princely\n heights, and overstepping the bounds of the authority conferred upon him, by\n excess of violence was causing trouble everywhere. For by his relationship to\n the imperial stock, and the affinity which he even then had with the name of\n Constantius, he was\n raised to such a height of presumption that, if he had been more powerful, he\n would have ventured (it seemed) upon a course hostile to the author of his good\n fortune. ",
                "1":" To his cruelty his wife was besides\n a serious incentive, a woman beyond measure presumptuous because of her kinship\n to the emperor, and previously joined in marriage by her father Constantine\n with his brother's son, King Hanniballianus. She, a Megaera\n in mortal guise, constantly aroused the\n savagery of Gallus, being as insatiable as he in her thirst for human blood.\n The pair in process of time gradually became more expert in doing harm, and\n through underhand and crafty eavesdroppers, who had the evil habit of lightly\n adding to their information and wanting to learn only what was false and\n agreeable to them, they fastened upon innocent victims false charges of\n aspiring to royal power or of practising magic. ",
                "2":" There stood out among their lesser atrocities, when their unbridled power\n had already surpassed the limits of unimportant delinquencies, the sudden and\n awful death of one Clematius, a nobleman of Alexandria. This man's\n mother-in-law, it was said, had a violent passion for her son-in-law, but was unable to seduce him; whereupon, gaining entrance to the\n palace by a back door, she presented the queen with a valuable necklace, and\n thus secured the dispatch of his death-warrant to Honoratus, at that time Count\n of the East; and so Clematius, a man contaminated by no guilt, was put to\n death without being allowed to protest or even to open his lips.\n \n ",
                "3":" After the perpetration of this impious deed,\n which now began to arouse the fears of others also, as if cruelty were given\n free rein, some persons were adjudged guilty on the mere shadow of suspicion\n and condemned. Of these some were put to death, others punished by the\n confiscation of their property and driven from their homes into exile, where,\n having nothing left save tears and complaints, they lived on the doles of\n charity; and since constitutional and just rule had given place to cruel\n caprice, wealthy and famous houses were being closed. ",
                "4":" And no words of an accuser, even though bribed, were required amid\n these accumulations of evils, in order that these crimes might be committed, at\n least ostensibly, under the forms of law, as has sometimes been done by cruel\n emperors; but whatever the implacable Caesar had resolved upon was rushed to\n fulfilment, as if it had been carefully weighed and determined to be right and\n lawful. ",
                "5":" It was further devised that sundry\n low-born men, whose very insignificance made them little to be feared, should\n be appointed to gather gossip in all quarters of Antioch and\n report what they had heard. These, as if travellers, and in disguise, attended\n the gatherings of distinguished citizens, and gained entrance to the houses of\n the wealthy in the guise of needy clients; then, being secretly admitted to the\n palace by a back door, they reported whatever they had been able to hear or\n learn, with one accord making it a rule to add inventions of their own and make\n doubly worse what they had learned, but suppressing the praise of Caesar which\n the fear of impending evils extorted from some against their will. ",
                "6":" And sometimes it happened that if the head of a\n household, in the seclusion of his private apartments, with no confidential\n servant present, had whispered something in the ear of his wife, the emperor\n learned it on the following day, as if it were reported by Amphiaraus or\n Marcius, those famous seers of old. And so even the walls, the only sharers of secrets, were\n feared. ",
                "7":" Moreover, his fixed purpose of\n ferreting out these and many similar things increased, spurred on by the queen,\n who pushed her husband's fortunes headlong to sheer ruin, when she ought\n rather, with womanly gentleness, to have recalled him by helpful counsel to the\n path of truth and mercy, after the manner of the wife of that savage emperor Maximinus, as we have related in our\n account of the acts of the Gordians.\n \n \n ",
                "8":" Finally, following an unprecedented and\n destructive course, Gallus also ventured to commit the atrocious crime which,\n to his utter disgrace, Gallienus is said to have once hazarded at Rome. Taking\n with him a few attendants with concealed weapons, he used to roam at evening\n about the inns and street-corners, inquiring of every one in Greek, of which he\n had remarkable command, what he thought of the Caesar. And this he did boldly\n in a city where the brightness of\n the lights at night commonly equals the resplendence of day. At last, being\n often recognized, and reflecting that if he continued that course he would be\n conspicuous, he appeared only in broad daylight, to attend to matters which he\n considered important. And all this conduct of his caused very deep sorrow to\n many.\n \n ",
                "9":" Now at that time Thalassius was the\n Praetorian Prefect at court, a man who was\n himself of an imperious character. He, perceiving that Gallus' temper was\n rising, to the peril of many, did not try to soothe it by ripe counsel, as\n sometimes high officials have moderated the ire of princes; but rather roused\n the Caesar to fury by opposing and reproving him at unseasonable times; very\n frequently he informed the emperor of Gallus' doings, exaggerating them and\n taking pains—whatever his motive may have been—to do it openly. Through this\n conduct the Caesar was soon still more violently enraged, and\n as if raising higher, as it were, the standard of his obstinacy, with no regard\n for his own life or that of others, he rushed on with uncontrollable\n impetuosity, like a swift torrent, to overthrow whatever opposed him.\n "

                "0":" And indeed this was not the only calamity to\n afflict the Orient with various disasters. For the Isaurians too,\n whose way it is now to keep the peace and now put everything in turmoil by\n sudden raids, abandoned their occasional secret plundering expeditions and, as\n impunity stimulated for the worse their growing boldness, broke out in a\n serious war. For a long time they had been inflaming their warlike spirits by\n restless outbreaks, but they were now especially exasperated, as they declared,\n by the indignity of some of their associates, who had been taken prisoner,\n having been thrown to beasts of prey in the shows of the amphitheatre at\n Iconium, a town of Pisidia—an outrage without precedent. ",
                "1":" And, in the words of Cicero, as even wild animals,\n when warned by hunger, generally return to the place where they were once fed,\n so they all, swooping like a whirlwind down from their steep and rugged\n mountains, made for the districts near the sea; and hiding themselves there in\n pathless lurking-places and defiles as the dark nights were coming on-the moon\n being still crescent and so not shining with full brilliance—they watched the\n sailors. And when they saw that they were buried in sleep, creeping on all\n fours along the anchor-ropes and making their way on tiptoe\n into the boats, they came upon the crew all unawares, and since their natural\n ferocity was fired by greed, they spared no one, even of those who surrendered,\n but massacred them all and without resistance carried off the cargoes, led\n either by their value or by their usefulness. ",
                "2":"\n This however did not continue long; for when the fate of those whom they had\n butchered and plundered became known, no one afterwards put in at those ports,\n but avoiding them as they would the deadly cliffs of Sciron, they\n coasted along the shores of Cyprus, which lie opposite to the crags of Isauria.\n ",
                "3":" Then presently, as time went on and\n nothing came their way from abroad, they left the sea-coast and withdrew to\n that part of Lycaonia that borders on Isauria; and there, blocking the roads\n with close barricades, they lived on the property of the provincials and of\n travellers. ",
                "4":" Anger at this aroused the\n soldiers quartered in the numerous towns and fortresses which lie near those\n regions, and each division strove to the best of its power to check the\n marauders as they ranged more widely, now in solid bodies, sometimes even in\n isolated bands. But the soldiers were defeated by their strength and numbers;\n for since the Isaurians were born and brought up amid the steep and winding\n defiles of the mountains, they bounded over them as if they were a smooth and\n level plain, attacking the enemy with missiles from a distance and terrifying\n them with savage howls. ",
                "5":" And sometimes our\n infantry in pursuing them were forced to scale lofty slopes, and when they lost\n their footing, even if they reached the very summits by catching hold of\n underbrush or briars, the narrow and pathless tracts allowed\n them neither to take order of battle nor with mighty effort to keep a firm\n footing; and while the enemy, running here and there, tore off and hurled down\n masses of rock from above, they made their perilous way down over steep slopes;\n or if, compelled by dire necessity, they made a brave fight, they were\n overwhelmed by falling boulders of enormous weight. ",
                "6":" Therefore extreme caution was shown after that, and when the\n marauders began to make for the mountain heights, the soldiers yielded to the\n unfavourable position. When, however, the Isaurians could be found on level\n ground, as constantly happened, they were allowed neither to stretch out their\n right arms nor poise their weapons, of which each carried two or three, but\n they were slaughtered like defenceless sheep.\n \n ",
                "7":" Accordingly these same marauders, distrusting\n Lycaonia, which is for the most part level, and having learned by repeated\n experience that they would be no match for our soldiers in a stand-up fight,\n made their way by retired by-paths into Pamphylia, long unmolested, it is true,\n but through fear of raids and massacres protected everywhere by strong\n garrisons, while troops were spread all over the neighbouring country.\n ",
                "8":" Therefore they made great haste, in order\n by extreme swiftness to anticipate the reports of their movements, trusting in\n their bodily strength and activity; but they made their way somewhat slowly to\n the summits of the hills over winding trails. And when, after overcoming\n extreme difficulties, they came to the steep banks of the Melas, a deep and\n eddying stream, which surrounds the inhabitants like a wall and protects them, the lateness of the night increased their alarm, and they\n halted for a time, waiting for daylight. They thought, indeed, to cross without\n opposition and by their unexpected raid to lay waste all before them; but they\n endured the greatest hardships to no purpose. ",
                "9":" For when the sun rose, they were prevented from crossing by the size of the\n stream, which was narrow but deep. And while they were hunting for fishermen's\n boats or preparing to cross on hastily woven hurdles, the legions that were\n then wintering at Side poured out and fell upon them in swift attack. And\n having set up their standards near the river-bank, the legions drew themselves\n up most skilfully for fighting hand to hand with a close formation of shields;\n and with perfect ease they slew some, who had even dared to cross the river\n secretly, trusting to swimming, or in hollowed out tree trunks. ",
                "10":" From there, after trying the skill of our soldiers\n even to a final test without gaining anything, dislodged by fear and the\n strength of the legions, and not knowing what direction to take, they came to\n the neighbourhood of the town of Laranda. ",
                "11":"\n There they were refreshed with food and rest, and after their fear had left\n them, they attacked some rich villages; but since these were aided by some\n cohorts of cavalry, which chanced to come up, the enemy withdrew without\n attempting any resistance on the level plain; but as they retreated, they\n summoned all the flower of their youth that had been left at home. ",
                "12":" And since they were distressed by severe hunger,\n they made for a place called Palaea, near the sea, which was protected by a\n strong wall. There supplies are regularly stored even to-day,\n for distribution to the troops that defend the whole frontier of Isauria.\n Therefore they invested that fortress for three days and three nights; but\n since the steep slope itself could not be approached without deadly peril, and\n nothing could be effected by mines, and no method of siege was successful, they\n withdrew in dejection, ready, under the pressure of extreme necessity, to\n undertake even tasks beyond their powers. ",
                "13":"\n Accordingly, filled with still greater fury, to which despair and famine added\n fuel, with increased numbers and irresistible energy they rushed on to destroy\n Seleucia, the metropolis of the province, which Count Castricius was holding\n with three legions steeled by hard service. ",
                "14":"\n Warned of their approach by trusty scouts, the officers of the garrison gave\n the watchword, according to regulations, and in a swift sally led out the\n entire force; and having quickly crossed the bridge over the river Calycadnus,\n whose mighty stream washes the towers of the city walls, they drew up their men\n in order of battle. And yet no one charged or was allowed to fight; for they\n feared that band on fire with madness, superior in numbers, and ready to rush\n upon the sword, regardless of their lives. ",
                "15":"\n Consequently, when the army came into view afar off, and the notes of the\n trumpeters were heard, the marauders stopped and halted for a while; then,\n drawing their formidable swords, they came on at a slower pace. ",
                "16":" And when the unperturbed soldiers made ready to meet\n them, deploying their ranks and striking their shields with their spears, an\n action which rouses the wrath and resentment of the combatants, they intimidated the nearest of the enemy by their very gestures.\n But as they were eagerly rushing to the fray, their leaders called them back,\n thinking it inadvisable to risk a doubtful combat when fortifications were not\n far distant, under the protection of which the safety of all could be put on a\n solid foundation. ",
                "17":" In this conviction, then,\n the warriors were led back within the walls, the entrances to the gates on all\n sides were barred, and they took their place on the battlements and pinnacles\n with rocks gathered from every hand and weapons in readiness, so that, if\n anyone should force his way near to the walls, he might be overwhelmed by a\n shower of spears and stones. ",
                "18":" Still, the\n besieged were greatly troubled by the fact that the Isaurians, having captured\n some boats which were carrying grain on the river, were abundantly supplied\n with provisions, while they themselves had already exhausted the regular stores\n and were dreading the deadly pangs of approaching famine. ",
                "19":" When the news of this situation spread abroad, and\n repeated messages dispatched to Gallus Caesar had roused him to action, since\n the Master of the Horse was at the time\n too far removed from the spot, orders were given to Nebridius, Count of the\n East. He quickly got together troops\n from every side and with the greatest energy was hastening to rescue this great\n and strategically important city from danger. On learning this, the freebooters\n departed without accomplishing anything more of consequence, and scattering\n (after their usual fashion) made for the trackless wastes of the high\n mountains.\n \n "

                "0":" When affairs had reached this stage in\n Isauria, the king of Persia, involved in war\n with his neighbours, was driving back from his frontiers a number of very wild\n tribes which, with inconsistent policy, often make hostile raids upon his\n territories and sometimes aid him when he makes war upon us. One of his\n grandees, Nohodares by name, having received orders to invade Mesopotamia\n whenever occasion offered, was carefully reconnoitring our territory, intending\n a sudden incursion in case he found any opening. ",
                "1":" And as all the districts of Mesopotamia, being exposed to frequent\n raids, were protected by frontier-guards and country garrisons, Nohodares,\n having turned his course to the left, had beset the remotest parts of Osdroene,\n attempting a novel and all but unprecedented manœuvre; and if he had succeeded,\n he would have devastated the whole region like a thunderbolt.

No man ever grasps a\n plough-handle or cultivates a tree, none seeks a living by tilling the soil,\n but they rove continually over wide and extensive tracts without a home,\n without fixed abodes or laws; they cannot long endure the same sky, nor does\n the sun of a single district ever content them.

And he was led off to execution unafraid,\n railing at the wickedness of the times and imitating the ancient stoic Zeno,\n who, after being tortured for a long time, to induce him to give false witness,\n tore his tongue from its roots and hurled it with its blood and spittle into\n the eyes of the king of Cyprus, who was putting him to the question.\n \n ",
                "6":" After this, the matter of the royal robe was\n investigated, and when those who were employed in dyeing purple were tortured\n and had confessed to making a short sleeveless tunic to cover the chest, a man\n named Maras was brought in, a deacon, as the Christians call\n them. A letter of his was presented, written in Greek to the foreman of a\n weaving plant in Tyre, strongly urging him to speed up a piece of work; but\n what it was the letter did not say. But although finally Maras also was\n tortured within an inch of his life, he could not be forced to make any\n confession. ",

And after many had been put to death,\n the two Apollinares, father and son, were exiled; but when they had come to a\n place called Craterae, namely, a villa of theirs distant twenty-four miles from\n Antioch, their legs were broken, according to orders, and they were killed.\n ",
                "8":" After their death Gallus, no whit less\n ferocious than before, like a lion that had tasted blood, tried many cases of\n the kind; but of all of these it is not worth while to give an account, for\n fear that I may exceed the limits which I have set myself, a thing which I\n certainly ought to avoid.\n "

When\n this man gave a true account of what Gallus and his wife had done, the emperor,\n grieving over the past disasters and made anxious by fear of those to come,\n concealed the distress that he felt as long as he could.

                "4":" This\n was a shrewd plan, cunningly devised with set purpose, in order that by a plot\n of that kind the uncle of Gallus might\n perish, for fear that so very powerful a man might whet the boldness of his\n nephew and encourage his dangerous designs. But great precautions were taken,\n and when the design was postponed, Eusebius, the grand chamberlain,\n \n was sent to Châlon taking gold with him; when this had been\n secretly distributed among the turbulent inciters of rebellion, the rage of the\n soldiers abated and the safety of the prefect was assured. Then an abundant\n supply of food arrived and the camp was moved on the appointed day. ",
                "5":" And so, after surmounting many difficulties, over\n paths many of which were heaped high with snow, they came near to Rauracum\n on the banks of the river\n Rhine. There a great force of the Alamanni opposed them, and hurling weapons\n from all sides like hail, by their superior numbers prevented the Romans from\n making a bridge by joining boats together. And when that was obviously\n impossible, the emperor was consumed with anxious thought and in doubt what\n course to take. ",
                "6":" But lo! a guide acquainted\n with the region unexpectedly appeared, and, in return for money, pointed out by\n night a place abounding in shallows, where the river could be crossed.

                "9":" Therefore the envoys of both kings were detained and\n the matter was discussed for a long time in secret; and since there was general\n agreement in the opinion that peace which was asked for on reasonable\n conditions ought to be granted, and that it would be expedient to do so under\n the present circumstances, the emperor summoned an assembly of the army,\n intending to say a few words appropriate to the occasion; and taking his place\n upon a tribunal, surrounded by a staff of high officials, he spoke after this\n fashion:\n \n ",

                "11":" For each one of you, according to\n his rank and judgment, upon consideration will find it to be true, that the\n soldier in all instances, however strong and vigorous of body, regards and\n defends only himself and his own life. The commander, on the other hand, has\n manifold duties, since he aims at fairness to all; and being the guardian of\n others' safety, he realises that the interests of the people look to him wholly\n for protection and that therefore he ought eagerly to seize upon all remedies\n which the condition of affairs allows, as though offered to him by the favour\n of Heaven. ",
                "12":" To put the matter, then, in a few\n words, and to explain why I have wished you all to be present \n here together, my loyal fellow-soldiers, receive with favourable ears what I\n shall briefly set forth; for perfect truth is always simple. ",
                "13":" The kings and peoples of the Alamanni, in dread of\n the rising progress of your glory, which fame, growing greatly, has spread\n abroad even among the dwellers in far off lands, through the envoys whom you\n see with bowed heads ask for peace and indulgence for past offences. This I,\n being cautious, prudent, and an advisor of what is expedient, think ought to be\n granted them (if I have your consent), for many reasons. First, to avoid the\n doubtful issue of war; then, that we may gain friends in place of enemies, as\n they promise; again, that without bloodshed we may tame their haughty\n fierceness, which is often destructive to the provinces; finally, bearing in\n mind this thought, that not only is the enemy vanquished who falls in battle,\n borne down by weight of arms and strength, but much more safely he who, while\n the trumpet is silent, of his own accord passes under the yoke and learns by\n experience that Romans lack neither courage against rebels nor mildness towards\n suppliants. ",
                "14":" In short, I await your decision\n as arbiters, as it were, being myself convinced as a peace-loving prince, that\n it is best temperately to show moderation while prosperity is with us. For,\n believe me, such righteous conduct will be attributed, not to lack of spirit,\n but to discretion and humanity. \n \n \n ",
                "15":" No sooner had he finished speaking than the\n whole throng, fully in agreement with the emperor's wish,\n praised his purpose and unanimously voted for peace. They were influenced\n especially by the conviction, which they had formed from frequent campaigns,\n that his fortune watched over him only in civil troubles, but that when foreign\n wars were undertaken, they had often ended disastrously. After this a treaty\n was struck in accordance with the rites of the Alamanni, and when the ceremony\n had been concluded, the emperor withdrew to Mediolanum for his winter\n quarters.\n "

And as he\n deliberated with his closest friends, in secret conferences and by night, by\n what force or by what devices that might be done before the Caesar's assurance\n should be more obstinately set upon throwing everything into disorder, it\n seemed best that Gallus should be summoned by courteous letters, under pretence\n of very urgent public business, to the end that, being deprived of support, he\n might be put to death without hindrance. ",
                "1":" But\n this view was opposed by the groups of fickle flatterers, among whom was\n Arbitio, a man keen and eager in plotting treachery, and Eusebius, at that time\n grand chamberlain, who was sufficiently\n inclined to mischief, and it occurred to them to say that, if Caesar left the\n East, it would be dangerous to leave Ursicinus there, since he would be likely to think of a loftier station, if there were on one\n to restrain him.

                "3":" When these and similar charges were dinned\n into the emperor's anxious ears, which were always attentive and open to such\n gossip, the turmoil of his mind suggesting many plans, he at last chose the\n following as the best. First, in the most complimentary terms he directed\n Ursicinus to come to him, under pretence that, because of the urgent condition\n of affairs at the time, they might consult together and decide what increase of\n forces was necessary in order to crush the attacks of the Parthian tribes,\n which were threatening war. ",
                "4":" And that\n Ursicinus might not suspect any unfriendly action, in case he should come,\n Count Prosper was sent to be his substitute until his return. So, when the\n letter was received and abundant transportation facilities\n were furnished, we hastened at full speed to Mediolanum.\n \n ",
                "5":" After this the next thing was to summon\n Caesar and induce him to make equal haste, and in order to remove suspicion,\n Constantius with many feigned endearments urged his sister, the Caesar's wife,\n at last to satisfy his longing and visit him. And although she hesitated,\n through fear of her brother's habitual cruelty, yet she set forth, hoping that,\n since he was her own brother, she might be able to pacify him. But after she\n had entered Bithynia, at the station called Caeni Gallicani, she was carried\n off by a sudden attack of fever. After her death the Caesar, considering that\n the support on which he thought he could rely had failed him, hesitated in\n anxious deliberation what to do. ",
                "6":" For in the\n midst of his embarrassments and troubles his anxious mind dwelt on this one\n thought, that Constantius, who measured everything by the standard of his own\n opinion, was not one to accept any excuse or pardon mistakes; but, being\n especially inclined to the ruin of his kin, would secretly set a snare for him\n and punish him with death, if he caught him off his guard. ",
                "7":" But in such a critical situation and anticipating the\n worst if he were not on the watch, he secretly aimed at the highest rank, if\n any chance should offer; but for a twofold reason he feared treachery on the\n part of those nearest to his person, both because they stood in dread of him as\n cruel and untrustworthy, and because they feared the fortune of Constantius\n which in civil discords usually had the upper hand. \n ",
                "8":" Amid this huge mass of anxieties he received\n constant letters from the emperor, admonishing and begging\n him to come to him and covertly hinting that the commonwealth could not be\n divided and ought not to be, but that each ought to the extent of his powers to\n lend it aid when it was tottering, doubtless referring to the devastation of\n Gaul. ",
                "9":" To this he added an example of not so\n very great antiquity, that Diocletian and his colleague\n were obeyed by their Caesars as by attendants, who\n did not remain in one place but hastened about hither and thither, and that in\n Syria Galerius, clad in purple, walked for nearly a mile before the chariot of\n his Augustus when the latter was angry with him.\n \n ",
                "10":" After many other messengers came Scudilo,\n tribune of the targeteers, a skilled artist in persuasion, under the cloak of a\n somewhat rough nature.

",
                "11":" And since, when the fates\n lay hands upon men, their senses are apt to be dulled and blunted, Gallus was\n roused by these blandishments to the hope of a better destiny, and leaving\n Antioch under the lead of an unpropitious power, he proceeded to go straight\n from the smoke into the fire, as the old proverb has it; and\n entering Constantinople as if in the height of prosperity and security, he\n exhibited horse-races and crowned Thorax the charioteer as victor.\n \n ",
                "12":" On learning this Constantius was enraged\n beyond all human bounds, and lest by any chance Gallus should become uncertain\n as to the future and should try in the course of his journey to take measures\n for his own safety, all the soldiers in the towns through which he would pass\n were purposely removed. ",
                "13":" And at that time\n Taurus, who had been sent to Armenia as quaestor, boldly passed that way\n without addressing him or going to see him. Others, however, visited him by the\n emperor's orders, under pretext of various matters of business, but really to\n take care that he should not be able to make any move or indulge in any secret\n enterprise; among these was Leontius, then quaestor and later prefect of the\n city, Lucillianus, as count commander of the household troops, and a tribune of\n the targeteers called Bainobaudes.

There he learned\n that certian Theban legions that were passing the winter in near-by towns had\n sent some of their comrades to encourage him by faithful and sure promises to\n remain there, since they were full of confidence in their strength and were\n posted in large numbers in neighbouring encampments; but owing to the watchful\n care of those about him, he could not steal an opportunity of seeing them or\n hearing the message that they brought.

                "15":" Then,\n as letter followed letter, urging him to leave, making use of\n ten public vehicles, as was directed, and leaving behind all his attendants\n with the exception of a few whom he had brought with him to serve in his\n bedroom and at his table, he was driven to make haste, being without proper\n care of his person and urged on by many, railing from time to time at the\n rashness which had reduced him, now mean and abject, to submit to the will of\n the lowest of mankind. ",
                "16":" Yet all this time,\n whenever nature allowed him sleep, his senses were wounded by frightful\n spectres that shrieked about him, and throngs of those whom he had slain, led\n by Domitianus and Montius, would seize him and fling him to the claws of the\n Furies, as he imagined in his dreams. ",
                "17":" For\n the mind, when freed from the bonds of the body, being always filled with\n tireless movement, from the underlying thoughts and worries which torment the\n minds of mortals, conjures up the nocturnal visions to which we give the name of phantasies.\n \n ",
                "18":" And thus with the way opened by the sad\n decree of fate, by which it was ordained that he should be stripped of life and\n rank, he hurried by the most direct way and with relays of horses and came to\n Petobio, a town of Noricum. There all the secret plots were revealed and Count\n Barbatio suddenly made his appearance—he had commanded the household troops\n under Gallus—accompanied by Apodemius, of the secret service, and at the head of soldiers whom Constantius had chosen because they\n were under obligation to him for favours and could not, he\n felt sure, be influenced by bribes or any feeling of pity.\n \n ",
                "19":" And now the affair was being carried on with\n no disguised intrigue, but where the palace stood without the walls Barbatio\n surrounded it with armed men. And entering when the light was now dim and\n removing the Caesar's royal robes, he put upon him a tunic and an ordinary\n soldier's cloak, assuring him with frequent oaths, as if by the emperor's\n command, that he would suffer no further harm. Then he said to him: Get\n up at once, and having unexpectedly placed him in a private\n carriage, he took him to Histria, near the town of Pola, where in former times,\n as we are informed, Constantine's son Crispus was killed. ",
                "20":" And while he was kept there in closest confinement,\n already as good as buried by fear of his approaching end, there hastened to him\n Eusebius, at that time grand chamberlain, Pentadius, the secretary, and\n Mallobaudes, tribune of the guard, to compel\n him by order of the emperor to inform them, case by case, why he had ordered\n the execution of all those whom he had put to death at Antioch. ",
                "21":" At this, o'erspread with the pallor of Adrastus,\n he was able to say only that he had\n slain most of them at the instigation of his wife Constantina, assuredly not knowing that when the mother of Alexander the\n Great urged her son to put an innocent man to death and said again and again,\n in the hope of later gaining what she desired, that she had carried him for\n nine months in her womb, the king made this wise answer: Ask some other\n reward, dear mother, for a man's life is not to be weighed against any\n favour. \n ",
                "22":" On hearing this the emperor, smitten with\n implacable anger and resentment, rested all his hopes of\n securing his safety on destroying Gallus; and sending Serenianus, who, as I\n have before shown, had been charged with high treason and acquitted by some\n jugglery or other, and with him Pentadius the secretary and Apodemius of the\n secret service, he condemned him to capital punishment. Accordingly his hands\n were bound, after the fashion of some guilty robber, and he was beheaded. Then\n his face and head were mutilated, and the man who a little while before had\n been a terror to cities and provinces was left a disfigured corpse. ",
                "23":" But the justice of the heavenly power was everywhere\n watchful; for not only did his cruel deeds prove the ruin of Gallus, but not\n long afterwards a painful death overtook both of those whose false\n blandishments and perjuries led him, guilty though he was, into the snares of\n destruction. Of these Scudilo, because of an abscess of the liver,\n vomited up his lungs and so died;\n Barbatio, who for a long time had invented false accusations against Gallus,\n charged by the whispers of certain men of aiming higher than the mastership of\n the infantry, was found guilty and by an unwept end made atonement to the\n shades of the Caesar, whom he had treacherously done to death.\n \n ",
                "24":" These and innumerable other instances of the\n kind are sometimes (and would that it were always so!) the work of Adrastia,\n the chastiser of evil deeds and the rewarder of good\n actions, whom we also call by the second name of Nemesis. She is, as it were,\n the sublime jurisdiction of an efficient divine power, \n dwelling, as men think, above the orbit of the moon; or as others define her,\n an actual guardian presiding with universal sway over the destinies of\n individual men. The ancient theologians, regarding her as the daughter of\n Justice, say that from an unknown eternity she looks down upon all the\n creatures of earth. ",
                "25":" She, as queen of causes\n and arbiter and judge of events, controls the urn with its lots and causes the changes of\n fortune, and sometimes she gives our plans a different result than that at which\n we aimed, changing and confounding many actions. She too, binding the vainly\n swelling pride of mortals with the indissoluble bond of fate, and tilting\n changeably, as she knows how to do, the balance of gain and loss, now bends and\n weakens the uplifted necks of the proud, and now, raising the good from the\n lowest estate, lifts them to a happy life. Moreover, the storied past has given\n her wings in order that she might be thought to come to all with swift speed;\n and it has given her a helm to hold and has put a wheel beneath her feet, in\n order that none may fail to know that she runs through all the elements and\n rules the universe. \n \n \n ",
                "26":" By this untimely death, although himself\n weary of his existence, the Caesar passed from life in the twenty-ninth year of\n his age, after a rule of four years. He was born in Etruria at Massa in the\n district of Veternum, being the son of Constantius, the brother of the emperor\n Constantine, and Galla, the sister of Rufinus and Cerealis, who were\n distinguished by the vesture of consul and prefect.

He had soft golden hair, and although his beard was just\n appearing in the form of tender down, yet he was conspicuous for the dignity of\n greater maturity. But he differed as much from the disciplined character of his\n brother Julian as did Domitian, son of Vespasian, from his brother Titus.\n ",
                "28":" Raised to the highest rank in Fortune's\n gift, he experienced her fickle changes, which make sport of mortals, now\n lifting some to the stars, now plunging them in the depths of Cocytus. But\n although instances of this are innumerable, I shall make cursory mention of\n only a few. ",
                "29":" It was this mutable and fickle\n Fortune that changed the Sicilian Agathocles from a potter to a king, and\n Dionysius, once the terror of nations, to the head of an elementary school, at\n Corinth. ",

                "31":" She, too, delivered Mancinus, after his\n supreme command, to the Numantians, Veturius to the cruelty of the Samnites,\n and Claudius to the Corsicans, and she subjected Regulus to the savagery of the\n Carthaginians. Through her injustice Pompey, after he had gained the surname\n Great by his glorious deeds, was butchered in Egypt to give\n the eunuchs' pleasure. ",
                "32":" Eunus, too, a\n workhouse slave, commanded an army of runaways in Sicily. How many Romans of\n illustrious birth at the nod of that same arbiter of events embraced the knees\n of a Viriathus or a Spartacus! How many heads dreaded by all nations has the fatal\n excutioner lopped off!

Very many\n however, scattering by narrow by-paths and saved from danger by the protecting\n darkness of the night, when daylight returned recovered their strength and\n rejoined each his own company.

He had as abettors and fellow conspirators, as\n uncertain rumours declared, Lampadius, the praetorian prefect, and Eusebius, former keeper of the privy\n purse, who had been nicknamed\n Mattyocopus, and Aedesius, late master of the rolls, all of whom the said prefect had arranged to have called\n to the consulship as his nearest friends. With a sponge he effaced the lines of\n writing, leaving only the signature intact, and wrote above it another text far\n different from the original, indicating that Silvanus in obscure terms was\n asking and urging his assistants within the palace or without official\n position, including both Tuscus Albinus and many more, to help him, aiming as\n he was at a loftier position and soon to mount to the imperial throne.\n ",

Thereby the prefect\n hoped that he would be rewarded by the emperor, as a most watchful and careful\n guardian of his safety. And when these letters, patched together with cunning\n craft, were read to the consistory, orders were given that those\n tribunes whose names were mentioned in the letters should be imprisoned, and\n that the private individuals should be brought to the capital from the\n provinces.

And he asked that\n he himself—leaving as hostages his relatives and having Mallobaudes, tribune of\n the heavy-armed guard, as surety for his return—might be commissioned to go\n quickly and fetch Silvanus, who was not entering upon any such attempt as those\n most bitter plotters had trumped up.

He, caring little for what might\n happen, on arriving in Gaul, departed from the instructions given him on his\n setting out and remained there without either interviewing Silvanus or citing\n him to come to court by delivering the letter; and associating with himself the\n fiscal agent of the province, as if the said infantry commander were proscribed\n and now to be executed, he abused his dependents and slaves with the arrogance\n of an enemy.

And when the judges had taken their seats, Florentius, son of\n Nigrinianus, at the time deputy master of the offices, on scrutinizing the script with greater care, and finding a kind\n of shadow, as it were, of the former letters, perceived what had been done, namely, that the earlier text had been\n tampered with and other matter added quite different from what Silvanus had\n dictated, in accordance with the intention of this patched-up forgery.\n ",
                "12":" Accordingly, when this cloud of deceit\n had broken away, the emperor, learning of the events from a faithful report,\n deprived the prefect of his powers, and gave orders that he should be put under\n examination; but he was acquitted through an energetic conspiracy of many\n persons. Eusebius, however, former count of the privy purse, on being put upon the rack, admitted that this had been\n set on foot with his cognizance. \n ",

So Silvanus, seeing no\n safety under present conditions, was driven to extreme measures, and having\n gradually spoken more boldly with the chief officers, he aroused them by the\n greatness of the reward he promised; then as a temporary expedient he tore the\n purple decorations from the standards of the cohorts and the\n companies, and so mounted to the imperial dignity.\n \n ",
                "16":" And while this was going on in Gaul, as the\n day was already drawing to its close, an unexpected messenger reached Milan,\n openly declaring that Silvanus, aiming higher than the command of the infantry,\n had won over his army and risen to imperial eminence. ",
                "17":" Constantius, struck down by the weight of this unexpected mischance\n as by a thunderbolt of Fate, called a council at about midnight, and all the\n chief officials hastened to the palace. And when no one's mind or tongue was\n equal to showing what ought to be done, mention in subdued tones was made of\n Ursicinus, as a man conspicuous for his sagacity in the art of war, and one who\n had been without reason provoked by serious injustice. And when he had been\n summoned by the master of ceremonies (which is the more honourable way) and had entered the\n council chamber, he was offered the purple to kiss much more graciously than\n ever before. Now it was the emperor Diocletian who was the first to introduce\n this foreign and royal form of adoration, whereas we have read that always\n before our emperors were saluted like the higher officials. \n ",

For great care was being taken that Silvanus\n should be destroyed as a very brave rebel; or, if that should fail, that\n Ursicinus, already deeply gangrened, should be utterly annihilated, in order\n that a rock so greatly to be dreaded should not be left.

                "19":" Accordingly, when arrangements were being made for\n hastening his departure, and the general undertook the refutation of the\n charges brought against him, the emperor, forestalling him by a mild address,\n forbade it, declaring that it was not the time for taking up the defence of a\n disputed case, when the urgency of pressing affairs which should be mitigated\n before it grew worse, demanded that parties should mutually be restored to\n their old-time harmony. ",
                "20":" Accordingly, after a\n many-sided debate, this point was chiefly discussed, namely, by what device\n Silvanus might be led to think that the emperor even then had no knowledge of\n his action. And they invented a plausible means of strengthening his\n confidence, advising him in a complimentary letter to receive Ursicinus as his\n successor and return with his dignities unimpaired. ",
                "21":" After this had been thus settled, Ursicinus was ordered to set\n forth at once, accompanied (as he had requested) by some tribunes and ten of\n the body-guard, to assist the exigencies of the state. Among these I myself was\n one, with my colleague Verinianus; all the rest were relatives and friends. ",
                "22":" And when he left, each of us\n attended him for a long distance in fear only for our own safety. But although\n we were, like gladiators, cast before ravening wild beasts, yet\n reflecting that melancholy events after all have this good sequel, that they\n give way to good fortune, we admired that saying of Tully's, delivered even\n from the inmost depths of truth itself, which runs as follows: And\n although it is most desirable that our fortune always remain wholly\n favourable, yet that evenness of life does not give so great a sense of\n satisfaction as when, after wretchedness and disaster, fortune is recalled\n to a better estate. \n \n \n \n ",
                "23":" Accordingly, we hastened by forced marches,\n since the commander-in-chief of the army, in his zeal, wished to appear in the\n suspected districts before any report of the usurpation had made its way into\n Italy. But for all our running haste, Rumour had flown before us by some aerial\n path and revealed our coming; and on arriving at Cologne we found everything\n above our reach. ",
                "24":" For since a great crowd\n assembled from all sides gave a firm foundation to the enterprise so timidly\n begun, and large forces had been mustered, it seemed, in view of the state of\n affairs, more fitting that our general should\n complaisantly favour the upstart \n emperor's purpose and desire to be strengthened in the growth of his power by\n deceptive omens; to the end that by means of manifold devices of flattery his\n feeling of security might be made more complete, and he\n might be caught off his guard against anything hostile. ",
                "25":" But the issue of this project seemed difficult; for\n special care had to be observed that the onsets should take advantage of the\n right moment, neither anticipating it nor falling short of it. Since if they\n should break out prematurely, we were all sure to suffer death under a single\n sentence.\n \n ",

But Marcellus, unware of this, presently came to\n Milan, blustering and making trouble, being a vain talkative fool and all but\n mad; and when admitted to the council, he charged Julian with being arrogant\n and already fitting himself with stronger pinions, so as to soar up higher; for\n thus he spoke with a mighty movement of his body to match his words.

But among brambles roses spring up, and among\n savage beasts some are tamed. Accordingly, I shall give a brief summary of the\n chief facts known about him. ",

There, as he\n grew up, he gradually gave evidence of virtuous living and intelligence. He\n received as much training in letters as might suffice for one of that station;\n conspicuous for his remarkable keenness in devising and solving difficult and\n knotty problems, he had extraordinary powers of memory; he was eager to do\n kindnesses and full of sound counsel. And if the emperor Constans had listened\n to him in times past, when Eutherius had grown up and was already mature, and\n urged honourable and upright conduct upon him, he would have been guilty of no\n faults, or at least of only pardonable ones. \n ",
                "5":" When he had become head chamberlain,\n he would sometimes criticise even Julian, as\n trained in the manners of Asia and therefore inconstant. Finally going into\n retirement, but afterwards summoned to the palace, always temperate and\n especially consistent, he so cultivated the noble virtues of loyalty and\n self-restraint that he was never charged, as the rest have been, with having\n disclosed a secret, unless it were to save another's life, or to have been\n kindled with a desire to increase his wealth. ",
                "6":"\n The result was, that when he presently retired to Rome and grew old there in a\n permanent home, he carried about with him a good conscience as his companion;\n he was honoured and loved by all classes, whereas that type of man, after\n amassing wealth by iniquitous means, usually seeks out secret lurking-places,\n like creatures of darkness shunning the sight of the multitude they have\n wronged. ",
                "7":" In unrolling many records of the\n past, to see to which of the eunuchs of old I ought to\n compare him, I could find none. True, there were in times gone by those that\n were loyal and virtuous (although very few), but they were stained with some\n vice or other. For along with the excellent qualities which anyone of them had\n acquired by studious endeavour or natural ability he was either extortionate or\n despicable for his cruelty, or prone to do mischief, or too subservient to the\n rulers, or insolent through pride of power; but of one so well equipped in\n every direction I confess I have neither read nor heard, although I have relied\n on the abundant testimony of our age.

He, resorting to every healing\n remedy, entirely cured the girl and was guarding her in complete security for\n her father, when the fortress in which he was beleagured began to be blockaded\n by Mallius Priscus, the Roman commander's lieutenant-general; and when\n Menophilus learned that its defenders were thinking of surrender, fearing lest,\n to her father's reproach, the high-born girl might be taken alive and suffer\n outrage, he killed her and then plunged the sword into his\n own vitals.

                "11":" And not content with that alone, he\n gathered for himself also rations to serve for twenty days.\n For the warriors the more willingly made use of what they had won by their own\n right hands, being greatly incensed because from the supplies which had just\n been brought them they could get nothing, since Barbatio had arrogantly\n appropriated a part of them, when they were passing near him; and piled in a\n heap what remained over and burned it. Whether he did this like an empty-headed\n fool, or at the emperor's bidding brazenly perpetrated his many abominable\n acts, has remained obscure up to this time. ",
                "12":"\n However, it was current rumour everywhere, that Julian was not chosen to\n relieve the distress of Gaul, but that he might meet his death in the cruellest\n of wars, being even then (as it was thought) inexperienced and one who could\n not stand even the clash of arms. ",
                "13":" While the\n fortifications of the camp were rapidly rising and part of the soldiers were\n garrisoning the country posts, part gathering in grain warily for fear of\n ambush, a horde of savages, outstripping by their extraordinary speed any\n rumour of their coming, with a sudden attack set upon Barbatio and the army he\n commanded, which was (as has been said) separated from the Gallic camp; and\n they followed them in their flight as far as Augst, and as much farther as they\n could; then, after seizing the greater part of his baggage and pack-animals,\n together with the camp-followers, they returned home again. ",
                "14":" And Barbatio, as if he had ended the campaign\n successfully, distributed his soldiers in winter quarters and returned to the\n emperor's court, to frame some charge against Caesar, as was his custom.\n \n "
            },
            "11":{
                "0":" When this disgraceful panic had been spread\n abroad, the kings of the Alamanni, Chonodomarius and Vestralpus, as well as\n Urius and Ursicinus, together with Serapio and Suomarius and Hortarius,\n collected all the flower of their forces in one spot and having ordered the\n horns to sound the war note, approached the city of Strasburg, thinking that\n Caesar had retired through fear of the worst, whereas he was even then busily\n employed in his project of completing the fort. ",
                "1":" Moreover, as they tossed their heads proudly, their confidence was increased\n by a deserter from the targeteers; who, in fear of punishment for a crime he\n had committed, went over to them after the departure of his defeated leader,\n and informed them that only thirteen thousand soldiers had stayed with Julian;\n and in fact that was the number of his followers, while savage ferocity was\n arousing the frenzy of battle on every side. ",
                "2":"\n Through this deserter's frequent repetition of that statement their confidence\n was raised still higher; they sent delegates to Caesar and imperiously enough\n commanded him to depart from the lands which they had won by valour and the\n sword. But he, a stranger to fear, neither lost his temper nor felt aggrieved,\n but laughing at the presumption of the savages, he detained the envoys until\n the work of fortification was ended and remained steadfast in the same attitude\n of resolution.\n \n \n ",
                "3":" Now King Chonodomarius was raising general\n disturbance and confusion, making his presence felt everywhere without limit, a\n leader in dangerous enterprises, lifting up his brows in pride, being as he was\n conceited over frequent successes. ",
                "4":" For he\n both met Decentius Caesar on equal terms and defeated him, and had destroyed\n and sacked many wealthy cities, and for a long time freely overran Gaul without\n opposition. To strengthen his confidence, there was added besides the recent\n rout of a general superior in numbers and strength. \n ",
                "5":" For the Alamanni, on seeing the devices of\n their shields, realised that these soldiers, who had given ground before a few\n of their brigands, were the men in fear of whom they had at times in the past\n scattered and fled with heavy losses, before coming to close quarters. All this\n caused Julian worry and anxiety, because at the instance of urgent necessity,\n with the partner of his danger gone, he was forced with only a few (though\n brave) troops to meet swarming tribes.\n \n ",
                "6":" Already the beams of the sun were reddening\n the sky, and the blare of the trumpets was sounding in unison, when the\n infantry forces were led out at a moderate pace, and to their flank were joined\n the squadrons of cavalry, among whom were the cuirassiers and the archers, a formidable branch of the service. ",
                "7":" And since from the place where the Roman standards\n had begun advancing, the distance to the enemy's camp was figured to be\n fourteen leagues—that is, twenty-one miles—Caesar had proper regard for both\n advantage and security, and having recalled his outposts, who had already gone ahead, and having proclaimed silence by the usual\n announcements, with his native calmness of speech he addressed the soldiers,\n who stood about him in companies, as follows:\n \n ",
                "8":"\n Regard for maintaining our common safety (to speak most sparingly) urges\n me, a Caesar far from pusillanimous, to urge and entreat you, fellow\n soldiers, to have confidence in our mature and sturdy courage, and to choose\n for all of us rather the path of caution, not the over-hasty and doubtful\n one, if we are to withstand or to repulse what we have to expect. For in the midst of peril, while it is proper\n that young men should be energetic and daring, they should also (when\n occasion requires) be docile and circumspect. Let me therefore in few words\n detail what my opinion is and see if you will give me leave, and your just\n anger upholds it. The day is already\n nearing noon; we are exhausted by the fatigue of the march; steep and blind\n paths will receive us; the moon is waning and the night will be relieved by\n no stars; the country is fairly ablaze with heat and relieved by no supply\n of water. If anyone should grant us the ability to pass through all this\n comfortably, what are we to do when the enemy's swarms rush upon us,\n refreshed as they will be with rest and food and drink? What strength can we\n have, when our limbs are enfeebled with hunger, thirst and toil, to offer\n resistance? Therefore, since even the\n most difficult situations have often been met by timely arrangement, and\n when suitable advice has been taken in good part, heaven-sent remedies have\n frequently restored the condition of affairs which threatened ruin, here, I ask of you, protected by a rampart and a trench\n and with our sentinels picketed, let us rest and for the present enjoy sleep\n and food suitable to the occasion; and then (with God's leave be it spoken)\n let us advance our triumphant eagles and victorious standards at the first\n break of day. \n \n \n ",
                "9":" The soldiers did not allow him to finish\n what he was saying, but gnashed and ground their teeth and showed their\n eagerness for battle by striking their spears and shields together, and\n besought him that they might be led against an enemy who was already in sight,\n trusting in the favour of God in Heaven, in their own self-confidence, and in\n the tried valour of their lucky general; and (as the event showed) a sort of\n helpful guardian spirit was urging them to the fray, so long as he could be at\n hand. ",
                "10":" To add to this eagerness there was the\n full approval of the high command and especially of Florentius, the praetorian\n prefect, who judged that though it was risky, they must none the less fight\n with hope of success while the savages were standing massed together; but if\n they scattered, the resentment of our soldiers, who, he said, are inclined by\n their native hotness of temper towards insubordination, would be impossible to\n withstand; for that victory (as they thought) should be wrested from their\n hands they would hardly endure without recourse to the last extremity.\n ",
                "11":" Furthermore, our men's confidence had\n been increased by a twofold consideration, since they recalled that during the\n year just elapsed, when the Romans were ranging freely all through the country\n beyond the Rhine, not a man was seen to defend his own home \n or to make a stand against them; but after blocking the paths everywhere with a\n thick barricade of felled trees, the savages, frost-bitten by winter climate,\n had much ado to live, moving far out of the way; and once the emperor had\n entered into their country they did not dare either to resist or show\n themselves, and obtained peace by suppliant entreaties. ",
                "12":" But no one noticed that now the state of the case\n was changed, since then they were threatened with ruin from three sides; the\n emperor was menacing them by way of Raetia, Caesar was near at hand and would\n not allow them to slip out anywhere, and their neighbours (whom civil strife\n had made their enemies) were all but treading on their necks while they were\n hemmed in on all sides. But later, peace was granted and the emperor had\n departed; the source of their quarrels having disappeared, the border tribes\n were now in agreement; and the shameful departure of the Roman commander had\n greatly increased the savageness implanted in them by nature. ",
                "13":" In another way also the Roman situation was made\n worse in consequence of the following occurrence: there were two brothers of\n royal blood, who, bound by the obligation of the peace which they had obtained\n from Constantius the year before, dared neither to raise a disturbance nor to\n make any move; but a little later, when one of them, Gundomadus, who was the\n stronger of the two and truer to his promise, had been treacherously murdered,\n all his tribe made common cause with our enemies, and at once the subjects of\n Vadomarius (against his will, as he insisted) united with the armies of the\n savages who were clamouring for war.\n \n \n ",
                "14":" So, since the whole army, from the highest\n to the lowest, agreed that then was the suitable time to fight, and did not in\n the least abate their inflexibility of spirit, one of the standard bearers\n suddenly cried: Forward, most fortunate of all Caesars, whither your\n lucky star guides you; in you at last we feel that both valour and good\n counsel are in the field. Leading the way for us like a lucky and valiant\n commander, you will find what the soldier will accomplish when his strength\n is called out to the full, under the eyes of a warlike general, the\n immediate witness of his achievements, if only the favour of the supreme\n deity be present. \n ",
                "15":" On hearing this no delay was permitted, but\n the army moved forward and approached a hill of gentle slope, covered with\n grain already ripe, and not far distant from the banks of the Rhine. From its\n top three of the enemy's cavalry scouts galloped off and hastened to their\n troops, to bring speedy word of the Roman army's approach. But one infantryman,\n who could not keep up with them, was caught through the quickness of our men,\n and reported that the Germans had been crossing the river for three days and\n three nights. ",
                "16":" When our leading officers\n espied them, now near at hand, taking their places in close wedge-formation,\n they halted and stood fast, making a solid line, like an impregnable wall, of\n the vanguard, the standard bearers, and the staff-officers; and with like wariness the enemy held their ground in\n wedge-formation. ",
                "17":" And\n when (just as the above mentioned deserter had told us) they saw all our\n cavalry opposite them on the right flank, they put all their strongest cavalry\n forces on their left flank in close order. And among them here and there they\n intermingled skirmishers and light-armed infantry, as safe policy certainly\n demanded. ",
                "18":" For they realised that one of\n their warriors on horseback, no matter how skilful, in meeting one of our\n cavalry in coat-of-mail, must hold bridle and shield in one hand and brandish\n his spear with the other, and would thus be able to do no harm to a soldier\n hidden in iron armour; whereas the infantry soldier in the very hottest of the\n fight, when nothing is apt to be guarded against except what is straight before\n one, can creep about low and unseen, and by piercing a horse's side throw its\n unsuspecting rider headlong, whereupon he can be slain with little trouble.\n ",
                "19":" Having made this arrangement, they\n provided their right flank with secret and puzzling ambuscades. Now all these\n warlike and savage tribes were led by Chonodomarius and Serapio, kings higher\n than all the rest in authority. ",
                "20":" And\n Chonodomarius, who was in fact the infamous instigator of the whole\n disturbance, rode before the left wing with a flame-coloured plume on his\n helmet, a bold man, who relied upon his mighty muscular strength, a huge figure\n wherever the heat of battle was looked for; erect on his foaming steed, he\n towered with a lance of formidable size; made conspicuous above others by the\n gleam of his armour, he was both a doughty soldier and a skilful general beyond\n all the rest. ",
                "21":" But the right wing was led by\n Serapio, who was still a young man with downy cheeks, but\n his ability outran his years; he was the son of Mederichus, Chonodomarius'\n brother, a man of the utmost treachery all his life; and he was so named\n because his father, who had for a long time been kept as a hostage in Gaul and\n had been taught certain Greek mysteries, changed his son's original native name\n of Agenarichus to that of Serapio. \n ",
                "22":" These were followed by the kings next in\n power, five in number, by ten princes, with a long train of nobles, and 35,000\n troops levied from various nations, partly for pay and partly under agreement\n to return the service.\n \n ",
                "23":" And now as the trumpets blared ominously,\n Severus, the Roman general in command of the left wing, on coming near the\n trenches filled with soldiers, from which it had been arranged that the men in\n concealment should rise up suddenly and throw everything into confusion, halted\n fearlessly, and being somewhat suspicious of ambuscades, made no attempt either\n to draw back or to go further. ",
                "24":" On seeing\n this, Caesar, who was courageous in the face of the greatest dangers,\n surrounded himself with an escort of two hundred horsemen, as the violence of\n this affair demanded, and with word and action urged the lines of infantry to\n deploy with swift speed. ",
                "25":" And since to\n address them all at once was impossible, both on account of the wide extent of\n the field and the great numbers of the multitude that had been brought together\n (and besides he avoided the heavy burden of jealousy, for fear of seeming to\n have affected that which the emperor supposed to be due to himself alone)\n without thought of his own safety he flew past the enemy's\n weapons and by these and similar speeches animated the soldiers, strangers as\n well as acquaintances, to deeds of valour. ",
                "26":"\n There has come now, comrades, the real time for fighting, which you and\n I have long since desired, and which you were just now demanding, when you\n were tumultuously calling for your weapons. \n ",
                "27":" Also, when he had come to others, who were\n stationed behind the standards and in the extreme rear, he said: Behold,\n fellow-soldiers, the long-hoped-for day is now here, forcing us all to wash\n away the old-time stains and restore its due honour to the majesty of Rome.\n These are the savages whom madness and excessive folly have driven on to the\n ruin of their fortunes, doomed as they are to be overwhelmed by our\n might. \n ",
                "28":" In the same way, as he arranged in better\n order others who were experienced by long practice in warfare, he cheered them\n with with such words of encouragement as these: Let us bestir ourselves,\n brave soldiers, and by seasonable valour do away with the reproaches\n inflicted upon our cause, in consideration of which I have hesitatingly\n accepted the title of Caesar. \n ",
                "29":" But whenever he saw any soldiers who were\n calling for the battle-signal out of season, and foresaw that they would by\n their riotous actions break discipline, he said: \"I beg of you, do not mar the\n glory of our coming victory by following too eagerly the enemy whom you are\n about to put to flight; and let none yield ground before the extremity of need.\n For I shall surely abandon those who are likely to flee, but I shall be\n inseparably present with those who shall wound their foemen's backs, provided that it be done with regard for judgment and caution.\n \n ",
                "30":" While he kept often repeating these and\n other words to the same effect, he placed the greater part of his army opposite\n the forefront of the savages, and suddenly there was heard the outcry of the\n German infantry, mingled with indignation, as they shouted with one accord that\n their princes ought to leave their horses and keep company with them, for fear\n that they, if anything adverse should occur, abandoning the wretched herd,\n would easily make shift to escape. ",
                "31":" On\n learning of this, Chonodomarius at once sprang down from his horse, and the\n rest, following his example, did the same without delay; for not one of them\n doubted that their side would be victorious.\n \n ",
                "32":" So, when the call to battle had been\n regularly given on both sides by the notes of the trumpeters, they began the\n fight with might and main; for a time missiles were hurled, and then the\n Germans, running forward with more haste than discretion, and wielding their\n weapons in their right hands, flew upon our cavalry squadrons; and as they\n gnashed their teeth hideously and raged beyond their usual manner, their\n flowing hair made a terrible sight, and a kind of madness shone from their\n eyes. Against them our soldiers resolutely protected their heads with the\n barriers of their shields, and with sword thrusts or by hurling darts\n threatened them with death and greatly terrified them. ",
                "33":" And when in the very crisis of the battle the\n cavalry formed massed squadrons valiantly and the infantry stoutly protected\n their flanks by making a front of their bucklers joined fast\n together, clouds of thick dust arose. Then there were various manœuvres, as our\n men now stood fast and now gave ground, and some of the most skilful warriors\n among the savages by the pressure of their knees tried to force their enemy\n back; but with extreme determination they came to hand-to-hand fighting,\n shield-boss pushed against shield, and the sky re-echoed with the loud cries of\n the victors or of the falling. And although our left wing, marching in close\n formation had driven back by main force the onrushing hordes of Germans and was\n advancing with shouts into the midst of the savages, our cavalry, which held\n the right wing, unexpectedly broke ranks and fled; but while the foremost of\n these fugitives hindered the hindmost, finding themselves sheltered in the\n bosom of the legions, they halted, and renewed the battle. ",
                "34":" Now that had happened for the reason that while the\n order of their lines was being re-established, the cavalry in coat-of-mail,\n seeing their leader slightly wounded and one of their companions slipping over\n the neck of his horse, which had collapsed under the weight of his armour,\n scattered in whatever direction they could; the cavalry would have caused\n complete confusion by trampling the infantry under foot, had not the latter,\n who were packed close together and intertwined one with the other, held their\n ground without stirring. So, when Caesar had seen from a distance that the\n cavalry were looking for nothing except safety in flight, he spurred on his\n horse and held them back like a kind of barrier. ",
                "35":" On recognising him by the purple ensign of a dragon, fitted to the\n top of a very long lance and spreading out like the slough\n of a serpent, the tribune of one of the squadrons stopped, and pale and struck\n with fear rode back to renew the battle. ",
                "36":"\n Whereupon Caesar, as is the custom to do in times of panic, rebuked them mildly\n and said: Whither are we fleeing, my most valiant men? Do you know not\n that flight never leads to safety, but shows the folly of a useless effort?\n Let us return to our companions, to be at least sharers in their coming\n glory, if it is without consideration that we are abandoning them as they\n fight for their country. \n ",
                "37":" By his tactful way of saying this he\n recalled them all to perform their duty as soldiers, following (though with\n some difference) the example of Sulla of old. For when he had led out his\n forces against Mithradates' general Archelaus and was being exhausted by the\n heat of battle and deserted by all his men, he rushed to the front rank, caught\n up a standard, flung it towards the enemy, and cried: Go your way, you\n who were chosen to be companions of my dangers, and to those who ask you\n where I, your general, was left, answer truthfully: ' Fighting alone in\n Boeotia, and shedding his blood for all of us. \n \n \n ",
                "38":" Then the Alamanni, having beaten and\n scattered our cavalry, charged upon the front line of the infantry, supposing\n that their courage to resist was now lost and that they would therefore drive\n them back. ",
                "39":" But as soon as they came to close\n quarters, the contest continued a long time on equal terms. For the Cornuti and\n the Bracchiati, toughened by long experience in fighting, at once intimidated\n them by their gestures, and raised their mighty battle-cry. This shout in the\n very heat of combat rises from a low murmur and gradually\n grows louder, like waves dashing against the cliffs. Then a cloud of hissing\n javelins flew hither and thither, the dust arose with steady motion on both\n sides and hid the view, so that weapon struck blindly on weapon and body\n against body. ",
                "40":" But the savages, thrown into\n disorder by their violence and anger, flamed up like fire, and hacked with\n repeated strokes of their swords at the close-jointed array of shields, which\n protected our men like a tortoise-formation. \n ",
                "41":" On learning this, the Batavians, with the\n Kings \n (a formidable band) came at\n the double quick to aid their comrades and (if fate would assist) to rescue\n them, girt about as they were, from the instant of dire need; and as their\n trumpets pealed savagely, they fought with all their powers. ",
                "42":" But the Alamanni, who enter eagerly into wars, made\n all the greater effort, as if to destroy utterly everything in their way by a\n kind of fit of rage. Yet darts and javelins did not cease to fly, with showers\n of iron-tipped arrows, although at close quarters also blade clashed on blade\n and breastplates were cleft with the sword; the wounded too, before all their\n blood was shed, rose up to some more conspicuous deed of daring. ",
                "43":" For in a way the combatants were evenly matched; the\n Alamanni were stronger and taller, our soldiers disciplined by long practice;\n they were savage and uncontrollable, our men quiet and wary, these relying on\n their courage, while the Germans presumed upon their huge size. ",
                "44":" Yet frequently the Roman, seem to have been a select\n body of household troops. The Batavians had no kings at this time. driven from his post by the weight of armed men, rose up\n again; and the savage, with his legs giving way from fatigue, would drop on his\n bended left knee and even thus attack his foe, a proof of extreme resolution.\n ",
                "45":" And so there suddenly leaped forth a\n fiery band of nobles, among whom even the kings fought, and with the common\n soldiers following they burst in upon our lines before the rest; and opening up\n a path for themselves they got as far as the legion of the Primani, which was\n stationed in the centrea strong feature called praetorian camp; there our\n soldiers, closely packed and in fully-manned lines. stood their ground fast and\n firm, like towers, and renewed the battle\n with greater vigour; and being intent upon avoiding wounds, they protected\n themselves like murmillos, and with drawn swords pierced the enemy's\n sides, left bare by their frenzied rage. ",
                "46":" But\n the enemy strove to lavish their lives for victory and kept trying to break the\n fabric of our line. But as they fell in uninterrupted succession, and the\n Romans now laid them low with greater confidence, fresh savages took the places\n of the slain; but when they heard the frequent groans of the dying, they were\n overcome with panic and lost their courage. ",
                "47":"\n Worn out at last by so many calamities, and now being eager for flight alone,\n over various paths they made haste with all speed to get away, just as sailors\n and passengers hurry to be cast up on land out of the midst\n of the billows of a raging sea, no matter where the wind has carried them; and\n anyone there present will admit that it was a means of escape more prayed for\n than expected. ",
                "48":" Moreover, the gracious will\n of an appeased deity was on our side, and our soldiers slashed the backs of the\n fugitives; when sometimes their swords were bent, and no weapons were at hand\n for dealing blows, they seized their javelins from the savages themselves and\n sank them into their vitals; and not one of those who dealt these wounds could\n with their blood glut his rage or satiate his right hand by continual\n slaughter, or take pity on a suppliant and leave him. ",
                "49":" And so a great number of them lay there pierced with mortal wounds,\n begging for death as a speedy relief; others half-dead, with their spirit\n already slipping away, sought with dying eyes for longer enjoyment of the\n light; some had their heads severed by pikes heavy as beams, so that they hung\n down, connected only by their throats; some had fallen in their comrades' blood\n on the miry, slippery ground, and although their persons were untouched by the\n steel, they were perishing, buried beneath the heaps of those who kept falling\n above them. ",
                "50":" When all this had turned out so\n very successfully, our victorious troops pressed on with greater vigour,\n blunting the edges of their swords with stroke after stroke, while gleaming\n helms and shields rolled about under foot. At last the savages, driven on by\n the utmost extremity, since the heaps of corpses were so high as to block their\n passage, made for the only recourse left, that of the river, which now almost\n grazed their backs. ",
                "51":" And since our indefatigable soldiers, running fast even under their\n armour, pressed upon them as they fled, some of them, thinking that by their\n skill in swimming they could save themselves from the dangers, committed their\n lives to the waves. Whereupon Caesar, with swift intelligence foreseeing what\n might happen, joined with the tribunes and higher officers in restraining\n shouts, forbidding any of our men in their over-eager pursuit of the enemy to\n entrust themselves to the eddying flood. ",
                "52":" As\n a result it was seen that they stood on the banks and transfixed the Germans\n with various kinds of darts; and if any of them by his speed escaped this\n death, he would sink to the bottom of the river through the weight of his\n struggling body. ",
                "53":" And just as in some\n theatrical scene, when the curtain displays many wonderful sights, so now one\n could without apprehension see how some who did not know how to swim clung fast\n to good swimmers; how others floated like logs when they were left behind by\n those who swam faster; and some were swept into the currents and swallowed up,\n so to speak, by the struggling violence of the stream; some were carried along\n on their shields, and by frequently changing their direction avoided the steep\n masses of the onrushing waves, and so after many a risk reached the further\n shores. And at last the reddened river's bed, foaming with the savages' blood,\n was itself amazed at these strange additions to its waters.\n \n ",
                "54":" While this was thus going on, King\n Chonodomarius found means to get away by slipping through the heaps of corpses\n with a few of his attendants, and hastened at top speed towards the camp which he had boldly pitched near the Roman\n fortifications of Tribunci and Concordia,\n his purpose being to embark in some boats which he\n had sometime before got ready for any emergency, and hide himself away in some\n secret retreat. ",
                "55":" And since he could not reach\n his own territories except by crossing the Rhine, he covered his face for fear\n of being recognised and slowly retired. But when he was already nearing the\n river-bank and was skirting a lagoon which had been flooded with marsh water,\n in order to get by, his horse stumbled on the muddy and sticky ground and he\n was thrown off; but although he was fat and heavy, he quickly escaped to the\n refuge of a neighbouring hill. But he was recognised (for he could not conceal\n his identity, being betrayed by the greatness of his former estate); and\n immediately a cohort with its tribune followed him with breathless haste and\n surrounded the wooded height with their troops and cautiously invested it,\n afraid to break in for fear that some hidden ambush might meet them among the\n dark shadows of the branches. ",
                "56":" On seeing them\n he was driven to the utmost fear and surrendered of his own accord, coming out\n alone; and his attendants, two hundred in number, with three of his closest\n friends, thinking it a disgrace to survive their king, or not to die for their\n king if an emergency required it, gave themselves up to be made prisoners.\n ",
                "57":" And as the savages are by nature humble\n in adversity and overbearing in success, subservient as he now was to another's\n will he was dragged along pale and abashed, tongue-tied by the consciousness of\n his crimes—how vastly different from the man who, after\n savage and woeful outrages, trampled upon the ashes of Gaul and threatened many\n dire deeds.\n \n ",
                "58":" So the battle was thus finished by the\n favour of the supreme deity; the day had already ended and the trumpet sounded;\n the soldiers, very reluctant to be recalled, encamped near the banks of the\n Rhine, protected themselves by numerous rows of shields, and enjoyed food and\n sleep.

But of the Alamanni there were counted six thousand corpses\n lying on the field, and heaps of dead, impossible to reckon, were carried off\n by the waves of the river. ",

",
                "61":" And to\n enhance their rejoicing over their success, he called an assembly and offered\n rewards, and then courteously gave orders that Chonodomarius should be brought\n before him; the king at first bowed down and then humbly prostrated himself on\n the ground; and when he begged for forgiveness in his native tongue, he was\n told to be of good courage. ",
                "62":" And a few days\n later he was conducted to the emperor's court and thence\n sent to Rome; there in the Castra Peregrina, which is on the Caelian Hill, he\n died from senile decay.\n \n ",
                "63":" On the successful outcome of these exploits,\n so numerous and so important, some of the courtiers in Constantius' palace\n found fault with Julian, in order to please the emperor himself, or facetiously\n called him Victorinus, on the ground that, although he was modest in making\n reports whenever he led the army in battle, he often mentioned defeats of the\n Germans. ",
                "64":" And between piling on empty praise,\n and pointing to what was clearly evident, they as usual puffed up the emperor,\n who was naturally conceited, by ascribing whatever was done anywhere in the\n world to his favourable auspices. ",
                "65":" As a\n consequence, he was elated by the grandiloquence of his sycophants, and then\n and later in his published edicts he arrogantly lied about a great many\n matters, frequently writing that he alone (although he had not been present at\n the action) had both fought and conquered, and had raised up the suppliant\n kings of foreign nations. If, for example, when he himself was then in Italy,\n one of his generals had fought bravely against the Persians, he would make no\n mention of him in the course of a very long account, but would send out letters\n wreathed in laurel to the detriment of the provinces, indicating with odious self-praise that he had fought\n in the front ranks. ",
                "66":" In short, there are\n extant statements filed among the public records of this emperor, in which\n ostentatious reports are given, of his boasting and exalting himself to the\n sky. When\n this battle was fought near Strasburg, although he was\n distant forty days' march, in his description of the fight he falsely asserts\n that he arranged the order of battle, and stood among the standard-bearers, and\n drove the barbarians headlong, and that Chonodomarius was brought to him,\n saying nothing (Oh, shameful indignity!) of the glorious deeds of Julian, which\n he would have buried in oblivion, had not fame been unable to suppress his\n splendid exploits, however much many people would have obscured them.\n "

Upon their departure our soldiers marched on\n undisturbed and plundered farms rich in cattle and crops, sparing none; and\n having dragged out the captives, they set fire to and burned down all the\n houses, which were built quite carefully in Roman fashion.

But in fear of\n the army, which had now returned, they possessed themselves of two strongholds,\n which had long since been left empty, and there defended themselves as well as\n they could. ",

You\n demand Mesopotamia as your own and likewise Armenia, and you recommend\n lopping off some members of a sound body, so that its health may afterwards\n be put upon a firm footing—advice which is rather to be refuted than to be\n confirmed by any agreement. Therefore listen to the truth, not obscured by\n any juggling, but transparent and not to be intimidated by any empty\n threats. My praetorian prefect, thinking\n to undertake an enterprise conducing to the public weal, entered into\n conversations with a general of yours, through the agency of some\n individuals of little worth and without consulting me, on the subject of\n peace. This we neither reject nor refuse, if only it take place with dignity\n and honour, without at all prejudicing our self-respect or our majesty.\n For at this time, when the sequence of\n events (may envy's breezes be placated!) has beamed in manifold form upon\n us, when with the overthrow of the usurpers the whole\n Roman world is subject to us, it is absurd and silly to surrender what we\n long preserved unmolested when we were still confined within the bounds of\n the Orient. \n Furthermore, pray make an end of those\n intimidations which (as usual) are directed against us, since there can be\n no doubt that it was not through slackness, but through self-restraint that\n we have sometimes accepted battle rather than offered it, and that when we\n are set upon, we defend our territories with the most valiant spirit of a\n good conscience; for we know both by experience and by reading that while in\n some battles, though rarely, the Roman cause has stumbled, yet in the main\n issue of our wars it has never succumbed to defeat. \n \n \n ",

Accordingly such terrible disasters happen either in seasons of\n stifling heat or after excessive precipitation of water from heaven.

Or they are climatiae \n which rush along to one side and obliquely,\n levelling cities, buildings, and mountains. Or they are chasmatiae, or gaping, which with their intensive movement suddenly\n open abysses and swallow up parts of the earth; as in the Atlantic Ocean an\n island more extensive than all Europe, and in the Crisaean\n Gulf, Helice and Bura; and in the Ciminian district of Italy the town\n of Saccumum; these were all sunk into the deep abysses of Erebus, and lie\n hidden in eternal darkness.

And contrary to his usual custom, he had marched so lazily that he\n intimidated the guides, who were leading the way rapidly, and threatened them\n with death unless they would all agree, and unanimously make a statement, that\n they were wholly ignorant of the region.

And they\n too in the same way gained the peace which they sought, and sooner than was\n expected they summoned from the innermost parts of the kingdom and brought in\n as hostages the sons of eminent men, and also our prisoners (as had been\n stipulated), from whom they parted with as deep sighs as they did from their\n own countrymen.\n \n \n ",
                "16":" These affairs once set in order, his\n attention was turned to the Sarmatians, who were deserving rather of pity than\n of anger; and to them this situation brought an incredible degree of\n prosperity; so that the opinion of some might well be deemed true, that fortune\n is either mastered or made by the power of a prince 18. The natives of this\n realm were once powerful and noble, but a secret conspiracy armed their slaves\n for rebellion; and since with savages all right is commonly might, they\n vanquished their masters, being their equals in courage and far superior in\n number.

Then their prince Vitrodorus, son of King Viduarius,\n and Agilimundus, his vassal, along with other nobles and officials governing various nations, seeing the army in the heart of their\n kingdom and native soil, prostrated themselves before the marching soldiers,\n and having gained pardon, did what was ordered, giving their children as\n hostages by way of pledge that they would fulfil the conditions imposed upon\n them.

Thus to the laurels of various\n victories there was added also the entreaties of those who had usurped freedom\n by arms; and such of them as survived bowed their necks with prayers before\n their former masters, whom they had despised as vanquished and weak, but now\n saw to be the stronger.\n \n ",

And these men, being\n taken under protection according to their own wish (as was believed) remained\n quiet for a short time; later, through their inborn savagery they were aroused\n to an outrage which brought them destruction, as will be\n shown in the proper place. \n \n \n ",

And as a\n crowning favour, he set over them, not some low-born king, but one whom they\n themselves had previously chosen as their ruler, a man eminent for his mental\n and physical gifts. \n ",

                "25":"\n The recollection of our glorious deeds, more grateful to brave men than\n any pleasure, moves me to rehearse to you, with due modesty, what abuses we\n most faithful defenders of the Roman state have corrected by the fortune of\n victory vouchsafed us by Providence both before our battles and in the very\n heat of combat. For what is so noble, or so justly worthy to be commended to\n the memory of posterity, as that the soldier should rejoice in his valiant deeds, and the leader in the sagacity of his\n plans. Our enemies in their madness were\n overrunning all Illyricum, with arrogant folly despising us in our absence,\n while we were defending Italy and Gaul, and in successive raids were laying\n waste our farthest frontiers, crossing the rivers now in dug-out canoes\n and sometimes on foot; they did not\n trust to engagements nor to arms and strength, but, as is their custom, to\n lurking brigandage, with the craft and various methods of deceit dreaded\n also by our forefathers from our very first knowledge of the race. These\n outrages we, being far away, endured as well as they could be borne, hoping\n that any more serious losses could be obviated by the efficiency of our\n generals. But when, encouraged by\n impunity, they mounted higher and burst forth in destructive and repeated\n attacks upon our provinces, after securing the approaches to Raetia and by\n vigilant guard ensuring the safety of Gaul, leaving no cause of fear behind\n us, we came into Pannonia, intending, if it should please eternal God, to\n strengthen whatever was tottering. And sallying forth when all was ready (as\n you know) and spring was well advanced, we took in hand a mighty burden of\n tasks: first, to build a close-jointed bridge, without being overwhelmed by\n a shower of missiles, a work which was easily completed; and when we had\n seen and set foot upon the enemy's territories, without any loss of our men\n we laid low the Sarmatians who, with spirits regardless of death attempted\n to resist us. And when with like impudence the Quadi bore aid to the\n Sarmatians and rushed upon the ranks of our noble legions, we trod them under foot. The latter, after grievous losses,\n having learned amid their raids and menacing efforts at resistance what our\n valour could effect, cast aside the protection of arms and offered hands\n that had been equipped for battle to be bound behind their backs; and seeing\n that their only safety lay in entreaties, they prostrated themselves at the\n feet of a merciful Augustus, whose battles they had often learned to have\n come to a happy issue. These barely\n disposed of, we vanquished the Limigantes as well with equal valour, and\n after many of them had been slain, avoidance of danger forced the rest to\n seek the protection of their lairs in the marshes. When these enterprises were brought to a successful issue, the\n time for seasonable mildness was at hand. The Limigantes we forced to move\n to remote places, so that they could make no further attempts to destroy our\n subjects, and very many of them we spared. And over the free Sarmatians we\n set Zizais, knowing that he would be devoted and loyal to us, and thinking\n it better to appoint a king for the savages than to take one from them; and\n it added to the happiness of the occasion, that a ruler was assigned them\n whom they had previously chosen and accepted. Hence a fourfold prize, the fruit of a single campaign, was won\n by us and by our country: first, by taking vengeance on wicked robbers;\n then, in that you will have abundant booty taken from the enemy; for valour\n ought to be content with what it has won by toil and a strong arm.\n We ourselves have ample wealth and\n great store of riches, if our labours and courage have preserved safe and\n sound the patrimonies of all; for this it is that beseems\n the mind of a good prince, this accords with prosperous successes.\n Lastly, I also display the spoil of an\n enemy's name, surnamed as I am Sarmaticus for the second time, a title not\n undeserved (without arrogance be it said), which you have with one accord\n bestowed upon me. \n \n After this speech was thus ended, the entire assembly with more enthusiasm than\n common, since the hope of betterment and gains had been increased, broke out\n into festal cries in praise of the emperor, and in customary fashion calling\n God to witness that Constantius was invincible, went back to their tents\n rejoicing. And when the emperor had been escorted to his palace and refreshed\n by two days' rest, he returned in triumphal pomp to Sirmium, and the companies\n of soldiers went back to the quarters assigned them.\n "

                "5":" And because Julian was anxious as to what\n ought to be done about the remaining troops which he had been ordered to send,\n and turned over many plans in his mind, he decided that the business ought to\n be managed with circumspection, pressed as he was on one side by savage\n barbarians and on the other by the authority of the emperor's orders; and since the absence of his commander of the cavalry\n in particular increased his uncertainty, he urged\n the prefect to return to him; the latter had gone some\n time before to Vienne, ostensibly to get supplies, but actually to escape\n troubles in the camp. ",
                "6":" For he bore in mind\n that it was in accordance with his own report, which he was thought to have\n sent some time before, that warlike troops, already formidable to the\n barbarians, were to be withdrawn from the defence of Gaul. ",
                "7":" So when he received Julian's letter, urging and\n begging him to hasten to come and aid his country by his counsels, he most\n emphatically refused; for his mind was disturbed with fear for the reason that\n Julian's letter plainly indicated that the prefect ought never to be separated from his commander in the stress\n of dangerous times. And Julian added that if Florentius hesitated to do his\n duty, he would himself of his own accord lay down the emblems of princely\n power, thinking it more glorious to meet death by order, than that the ruin of\n the provinces should be attributed to him. But the obstinate resolution of the\n prefect prevailed, and with the greatest emphasis he refused to obey these\n reasonable demands.\n \n ",
                "8":" However, amid this delay of the absent\n Lupicinus and of the prefect, who feared mutinies of the soldiers, Julian,\n deprived of the aid of counsellors and wavering in anxious hesitation, thought\n the following plan the best: he called out all the soldiers in the usual manner\n from the posts in which they were passing the winter, and\n arranged to hasten them on their way. ",
                "9":"\n Scarcely was this known, when someone in the camp of the Petulantes secretly\n threw on the ground a libellous letter, which among many other things contained\n the following: We verily are driven to the ends of the earth like\n condemned criminals, and our dear ones, whom we freed from their former\n captivity after mortal battles, will again be slaves to the\n Alamanni. \n ",
                "10":" When this note was brought to headquarters\n and read, Julian, although he found the complaints reasonable, nevertheless\n ordered them to set out with their families for the Orient, giving them the\n privilege of using the wagons of the courier-service. And when there was considerable hesitation as to what route they should\n take, it was decided, at the suggestion of the secretary Decentius, that they\n should all go by way of Paris, where Julian still lingered, having as yet made\n no move. And it was so done. ",
                "11":" And when the\n soldiers arrived Caesar met them in the suburbs, and, in his usual manner\n praising those whom he personally knew, and reminding each one of his valiant\n deeds, with mild words he encouraged them to go with cheerful step to Augustus,\n where there was great and extensive power, and they would get worthy rewards\n for their toil. ",
                "12":" And in order to treat with\n greater honour those who were going far away, he invited their officers to\n dinner and bade them make any request that was in their minds. And since they\n were so liberally entertained, they departed anxious and filled with twofold\n sorrow: because an unkindly fortune was depriving them\n both of a mild ruler and of the lands of their birth. But though possessed by\n this sorrow, they were apparently consoled and remained quiet in their\n quarters. ",
                "13":" But no sooner had night come on\n than they broke out in open revolt, and, with their minds excited to the extent\n that each was distressed by the unexpected occurrence, they turned to arms and\n action; with mighty tumult they all made for the palace, and wholly surrounding it, so that no one could possibly get out, with\n terrifying outcries they hailed Julian as Augustus, urgently demanding that he\n should show himself to them. They were compelled to wait for the appearance of\n daylight, but finally forced him to come out; and as soon as they saw him, they\n redoubled their shouts and with determined unanimity hailed him as\n Augustus.\n \n ",
                "14":" He, however, with unyielding resolution,\n opposed them one and all, now showing evident displeasure, again begging and\n entreating them with outstretched hands that after many happy victories nothing\n unseemly should be done, and that ill timed rashness and folly should not stir\n up material for discord. And when he had at last quieted them, with mild words\n he addressed them as follows:\n \n ",
                "15":"\n Let your anger, I pray you, cease for a time. Without dissension or\n attempts at revolution what you demand shall easily be obtained. And since\n it is the charm of your native land that holds you back and you dread\n strange places with which you are unacquainted, return at\n once to your homes; you shall see nothing beyond the Alps, since that is\n displeasing to you, and this I will justify to Augustus to his entire\n satisfaction, since he is willing to listen to reason and is most\n discreet. \n \n \n ",
                "16":" After this the shouts continued none the\n less on every side, and since all insisted with one and the same ardour and\n with loud and urgent outcries mingled with abuse and insults, Caesar was\n compelled to consent. Then, being placed upon an infantryman's shield \n and raised on high, he was hailed by all as Augustus and bidden to bring out a\n diadem. And when he declared that he had never had one, they called for an\n ornament from his wife's neck or head. ",
                "17":" But\n since he insisted that at the time of his first auspices it was not fitting for\n him to wear a woman's adornment, they looked about for a horse's trapping, so\n that being crowned with it he might display at least some obscure token of a\n loftier station. But when he declared that this also was shameful, a man called\n Maurus, afterwards a count and defeated at the pass of Succi, but then a standard-bearer of the Petulantes, took off the neck-chain which he wore as\n carrier of the dragon and boldly placed it on Julian's head. He,\n driven to the extremity of compulsion, and perceiving that he could not avoid\n imminent danger if he persisted in his resistance, promised each man five gold\n pieces \n and a pound of silver.\n \n \n ",
                "18":" When this was done, troubled with no less\n anxiety than before and with quick intuition foreseeing the future, he neither\n wore a diadem, nor dared to appear anywhere or attend to any of the serious\n matters that were most pressing. ",
                "19":" But when he\n had withdrawn to seclusion and retirement, alarmed by the change in his\n fortunes, one of the decurions of the palace, which is a position of dignity,\n hastened at rapid pace to\n the camp of the Petulantes and Celts, and wildly cried that a shameful crime\n had been committed, in that the man whom the day before their choice had\n proclaimed Augustus had been secretly done to death. ",
                "20":" Upon hearing this the soldiers, who were equally excited by all\n news, known to be true or not, some brandishing darts, others with naked swords\n and uttering threats, rushing forth from different sides and in disorder (as is\n usual in a sudden commotion) quickly filled the palace. The fearful uproar\n alarmed the guards, the tribunes, and the count in command of the household\n troops, Excubitor by name, and in fear of treachery from the fickle soldiers\n they scattered in dread of sudden death and vanished from sight. ",
                "21":" The armed men, however, seeing the perfect quiet,\n stood motionless for a time, and on being asked what was the cause of the\n ill-advised and sudden commotion, they kept silence for a long time, being in\n doubt as to the new emperor's safety; and they would not leave until they were\n admitted to the council chamber and had seen him resplendent in the imperial\n garb. These preserved order and acted as adjutants to the emperor.\n "

Since then I have never been thwarted in my purpose of right\n living, and I have been closely observed with you in all your toils, when\n through the widespread arrogance of foreign nations, after the destruction\n of cities and the loss of countless thousands of our men, incalculable\n disaster was overrunning the few regions that were left\n half ruined. It is needless, methinks, to rehearse how often in raw winter\n and under a cold sky, when lands and seas are exempt from the labours of\n Mars, we repelled the hitherto invincible Alamanni and broke their strength.\n But this surely it is right neither to\n pass by nor consign to silence, that when that happiest of days dawned near\n Argentoratus, which in a sense brought lasting freedom to the Gauls, while I\n hastened about amid showers of weapons, you, upheld by your might and by\n long experience, overcame the enemy, rushing on like mountain torrents,\n either striking them down with the steel or plunging them in the river's\n depths; and that too with but few of our number left upon the field, whose\n funerals we honoured with plentiful praise rather than with grief.\n After such great and glorious exploits,\n posterity, I believe, will not be silent about your services to your\n country, which are now well known to all nations, if you defend with courage\n and resolution the man whom you have honoured with a higher title of\n majesty, in case any adverse fortune should assail him. And to the end that a sound course of conduct may\n be maintained, that the rewards of brave men may remain free from\n corruption, and that secret intrigue may not usurp honours, this I declare\n in the presence of your honorable assembly: that no civil official, no\n military officer, shall reach a higher rank through anyone supporting him\n beyond his merits, and that none who tries to intrigue for another shall\n escape without dishonour. \n \n \n ",
                "3":" Through confidence in this promise the\n soldiers of lower rank, who had long had no share in honours \n and rewards, were inspired with greater hope; rising to their feet and clashing\n their spears against their shields with mighty din, almost with one voice they\n acclaimed the emperor's words and plans. ",
                "4":" And\n at once, lest even an instant should be allowed to interfere with so resolved a\n purpose, the Petulantes and Celts begged in behalf of certain commissaries\n that they might be sent as governors to whatever provinces\n they might choose; and when the request was denied, they withdrew neither\n offended nor ill-humoured.\n \n ",
                "5":" But in the night before he was proclaimed\n Augustus, as the emperor told his nearer and more intimate friends, a vision\n appeared to him in his sleep, taking the form in which the guardian spirit of\n the state is usually portrayed, and in a tone of reproach spoke as follows:\n Long since, Julian, have I been secretly watching the vestibule of\n your house, desiring to increase your rank, and I have often gone away as\n though rebuffed. If I am not to be received even now, when the judgements of\n many men are in agreement, I shall depart downcast and forlorn.

So, having\n increased his arms and his power and crossed the Tigris in due form, he\n proceeded to attack Singara, a town which, in the opinion of those who had\n charge of that region, was abundantly fortified with soldiers and with all\n necessities.

Bezabde was a very strong fortress, placed upon a\n hill of moderate height which sloped towards the banks of the Tigris, and where\n it was low and therefore exposed to danger it was fortified with a double wall.\n For the defence of the place three legions were assigned, the Second Flavian,\n the Second Armenian, and also the Second Parthian with a great number of bowmen\n of the Zabdiceni, on whose soil, at that time subject to us, this town was\n situated.\n \n ",

                "3":" When these heralds dared to come\n close, the defenders of the walls spared them for the reason that they had\n brought in close company with them some freeborn men who had been taken\n prisoner at Singara and were recognised by the garrison. In pity for these men\n no one hurled a weapon; but to the offer of peace no answer was made.\n \n ",
                "4":" Then a truce was granted for a whole day and night, but before the\n beginning of the next day the entire force of the Persians fiercely attacked\n the rampart, uttering cruel threats and roaring outcries; and when they had\n boldly advanced close up to the walls, they began to fight with the townsmen,\n who resisted with great vigour.

For clouds of\n arrows flew thick and fast, and transfixed the defenders as\n they stood crowded together. After sunset the two parties separated with equal\n losses, but just before dawn of the following day, while the trumpets sounded\n on one side and the other, the struggle was renewed with much greater ardour\n than before, and on either side equally great heaps of dead were to be seen,\n since both parties fought most obstinately.\n \n ",

                "7":"\n There being given permission to say what he wished, with mild words he advised\n the Persians to return to their homes, declaring that after the lamentable\n losses on both sides it was to be feared that perhaps even greater ones might\n follow. But it was in vain that he persisted in making these and many similar\n pleas, opposed as they were by the frenzied rage of the king, who roundly swore\n that he would not leave the place until the fortress had been destroyed.\n ",
                "8":" But the bishop incurred the shadow of a\n suspicion, unfounded in my opinion, though circulated confidently by many, of\n having told Sapor in a secret conference what parts of the wall to attack, as\n being slight within and weak. And in the end there seemed to be ground for\n this, since after his visit the enemy's engines deliberately battered those\n places which were tottering and insecure from decay, and that too with spiteful exultation, as if those who directed them were\n acquainted with conditions within.\n \n ",
                "9":" And though the narrow footpaths yielded\n difficult access to the walls, and the rams that had been prepared were moved\n forward with difficulty, since the fear of stones thrown by hand and of arrows\n kept them off, yet neither the ballistae nor the scorpions ceased, the former\n to hurl darts, the latter showers of stones and with them blazing wicker\n baskets, smeared with pitch and bitumen. Because of the constant fall of these\n as they rolled down the slope, the engines were halted as though held fast by\n deep roots, and the constant shower of fiery darts and brands set them on\n fire.\n \n ",
                "10":" But in spite of all this, and though many\n fell on both sides, the besiegers were fired with the greater desire to destroy\n the town, defended though it was by its natural situation and by mighty works,\n before the winter season, believing that the king's rage could not be quieted\n until that was done. Therefore neither the great outpouring of blood nor the\n many mortal wounds that were suffered deterred the survivors from like\n boldness. ",

                "12":" However, one ram, higher than the rest, which was covered with wet\n bull's hide and therefore less exposed to danger from fire or darts, having\n gone ahead of all the others, made its way with mighty efforts to the wall.\n There, digging into the joints of the stones with its huge beak, it weakened a tower and overthrew it. As this fell with a mighty\n roar, those also who stood upon it were thrown down by its sudden collapse and\n either dashed to pieces or buried. Thus they perished by varied and\n unlooked-for forms of death, while the armed hordes of the enemy, finding the\n ascent safer, rushed into the town.\n \n ",
                "13":" Then, while the din of the yelling Persians\n thundered on all sides in the terrified ears of the overmatched townsmen, a\n hotter fight raged within the walls, as bands of our soldiers and of the enemy\n struggled hand to hand; and since they were crowded body to body and both sides\n fought with drawn swords, they spared none who came in their way.

                "14":" Finally the besieged, after long resisting imminent\n destruction, were at last with great difficulty scattered in all directions by\n the weight of the huge throng. After that the swords of the infuriated enemy\n cut down all that they could find, children were torn from their mothers'\n breasts and the mothers themselves were butchered, and no man recked what he\n did. Amid such scenes of horror that nation, greedier still for plunder,\n laden with spoils of every sort, and\n leading off a great throng of captives, returned in triumph to their tents.\n \n ",

For he feared what\n actually happened, namely, that the Romans,\n taking to heart the loss of such a powerful stronghold, would strive with all\n their might to recover it.\n \n ",
                "16":" Then, filled with greater confidence and\n inspired with the hope of accomplishing whatever he might undertake, after\n capturing some insignificant strongholds, he prepared to attack Virta, a\n fortress of great antiquity, since it was believed to have been built by\n Alexander of Macedon; it was situated indeed on the outer frontier of\n Mesopotamia, but was girt by walls with salient and re-entrant angles and made\n difficult of access by manifold devices.

And when with their native resolution they rejected these offers,\n being men of good birth and inured to perils and hardships, all the\n preparations for a siege were made.\n \n \n ",

The unlooked-for sight of this and the skilful manner in which it was\n put together would have daunted the besieged, who had already\n been almost reduced to seeking safety in surrender, had they not taken heart\n again and prepared defences against the menacing engine.

For although the ram, which was old and had been taken apart\n for ready transportation, was being set up with all skill and with every\n exertion of power, and was protected by the besiegers with a mantlet of great\n strength, yet the artillery and the showers of stones and sling-shots continued\n none the less to destroy great numbers on both sides. The massive mounds too\n were rising with rapid additions, the siege grew hotter every day, and many of\n our men fell for the reason that, fighting as they were under the emperor's\n eye, through the hope of rewards and wishing to be easily recognised they put\n off their helmets from their heads and so fell victims to the skill of the\n enemy's archers.

The Persians, too, when the\n height of the mounds had already become great, stricken with horror of the huge\n ram, which other smaller ones followed, all strove with might and main to set\n fire to them, constantly hurling firebrands and blazing darts. But their\n efforts were vain, for the reason that the greater part of the timbers were\n covered with wetted hides and rags, while in other places they had been\n carefully coated with alum, so that the fire fell on them without effect.

                "14":" And on the other hand the\n defenders, when the huge ram was already drawing near to shake down a tower\n which stood in its way, by a subtle device entangled its projecting iron end\n (which in fact has the shape of a ram's head) on both sides with very long\n ropes, and held it so that it might not move back and gather new strength, nor\n be able with good aim to batter the walls with repeated lunges; and in the\n meantime they poured down scalding-hot pitch. And the engines which had been\n brought up stood for a long time exposed to the huge stones and to the\n missiles.\n \n ",
                "15":" And now, when the mounds were raised still\n higher, the garrison, fearing that destruction would soon be upon them unless\n they should rouse themselves, resorted to utter recklessness. Making a sudden\n rush through the gates, they attacked the foremost of our men, with all their\n strength hurling upon the rams firebrands and baskets made of iron and filled\n with flames. ",
                "16":" But after fighting with\n shifting fortune the greater number were driven back within the walls without\n effecting anything. Then those same Persians, when they had taken their place\n on the bulwarks were assailed from the mounds, which the Romans had raised,\n with arrows, sling-shots, and fiery darts, which, however, though they flew\n through the coverings of the towers, for the most part fell without effect,\n since there were men at hand to put out the fires.\n \n ",
                "17":" And when the fighting men on both sides\n became fewer, and the Persians were driven to the last extremity unless some\n better plan should suggest itself, a carefully devised sally\n from the fortress was attempted. A vast throng made a sudden rush, with still\n greater numbers of men carrying material for setting fires drawn up among the armed\n soldiers; then iron baskets filled with flames were hurled upon the woodwork,\n as well as faggots and other things best suited for kindling fires. ",
                "18":" And because the pitch-black clouds of smoke made it\n impossible to see, the legions were roused to the fight by the clarion and in\n battle array advanced at rapid pace. Then, as their ardour for fighting\n gradually increased and they had come to hand-to-hand conflict, on a sudden all\n the siege-engines were destroyed by the spreading flames, except the greater\n ram; this, after the ropes which had been thrown from the walls and entangled\n it had been broken, the valiant efforts of some brave men barely rescued in a\n half-burned condition.\n \n ",
                "19":" But when the darkness of night put an end to\n the fighting, the rest which was allowed the soldiers was not for long. For\n after being refreshed with a little food and sleep, they were aroused at the\n call of their officers and moved the siege-engines to a distance from the wall,\n preparing to fight with greater ease on the lofty earthworks, which were now finished and\n overtopped the walls. And in order that those who would defend the ramparts\n might the more readily be kept back, on the very highest part of each mound two\n ballistae were placed, through fear of which it was believed that no one of the\n enemy would be able even to put out his head. ",
                "20":" When these preparations had been sufficiently made, just before dawn our men\n were drawn up in three divisions and tried an assault upon the walls, the cones of their helmets nodding in threatening wise and\n many carrying scaling-ladders. And now, while arms clashed and trumpets brayed,\n both sides fought with equal ardour and courage. And as the Romans extended\n their forces more widely and saw that the Persians were in hiding through fear\n of the engines placed upon the mounds, they attacked a tower with the ram; and\n in addition to mattocks, pickaxes, and crowbars the scaling- ladders also drew\n near, while missiles flew thick and fast from both sides. ",
                "21":" The Persians, however, were more sorely troubled by\n the various missiles sent from the ballistae, which as if along a tight rope rushed down the artificial slopes of the earthworks.\n Therefore, thinking that their fortunes were now at their lowest ebb, they\n rushed to meet certain death, and distributing the duties of their soldiers in\n the midst of their desperate crisis, they left some behind to hold the walls,\n while a strong force secretly opened a postern gate and rushed out, drawn sword\n in hand, followed by others who carried concealed fires. ",
                "22":" And while the Romans now pressed hard on those who\n gave way, and now met those who ventured to charge, the men who carried the\n fire-pans, stooping low and creeping along, pushed live coals into the joints\n of one of the mounds, which was built of the boughs of various kinds of trees,\n of rushes, and of bundles of cane. These, as soon as the dry fuel caught fire,\n at once burst into flame, and our soldiers only with extreme\n peril got away with their engines uninjured.\n \n ",
                "23":" But when the coming of evening put an end to\n the fighting, and both sides withdrew for a brief rest, the emperor, divided\n between various plans and pondering them—since pressing reasons urged a longer\n attempt to destroy Phaenicha, a fortress opposed as an almost unsurmountable\n barrier to the enemy's inroads; but the lateness of the season dissuaded\n him—finally decided to stay there, and to carry on light skirmishes, thinking\n that perhaps the Persians would yield through lack of supplies. But the result\n was not what he looked for. ",
                "24":" For when the\n fighting slackened, wet weather followed, dripping clouds with menacing\n darkness appeared, and the ground was so drenched with continual rains, that\n soft and sticky mud caused general trouble in that region of rich turf. And,\n besides all this, thunder and lightning with repeated crashes terrified the\n timorous minds of men.\n \n ",
                "25":" More than this, rainbows were constantly\n seen; and how that phenomenon is wont to occur, a brief explanation will show.\n The warmer exhalations of the earth and its moist vapours are condensed into\n clouds; these are then dissipated into a fine spray, which, made brilliant by\n the sun's rays that fall upon it, rises swiftly and, coming opposite the fiery\n orb itself, forms the rainbow. And the bow is rounded into a great curve,\n because it extends over our world, which the science of natural philosophy\n tells us rests upon a hemisphere. \n ",
                "26":" Its first colour, so far as mortal eye can\n discern, is yellow, the second golden or tawny, the third\n red, the fourth violet, and the last\n blue verging upon green. ",
                "27":" It shows this\n combination of beautiful colours, as earthborn minds conceive, for the reason\n that its first part, corresponding in colour with the surrounding air, appears\n paler; the second is tawny, that is, somewhat more vivid than yellow; the third\n is red, because it is exposed to the brightness of the sun, and in proportion\n to alternation in the air absorbs its brilliance most purely, being just\n opposite; the\n fourth is violet, because receiving the brightness of the sun's rays with a\n thick rain of spray glittering between, through which it rises, it shows an\n appearance more like fire; and that colour, the more it spreads, passes over\n into blue and green.\n \n ",
                "28":" Others think that the form of the rainbow\n appears to earthly sight when the rays of the sun penetrate a thick and lofty\n cloud and fill it with clear light. Since this does not find an outlet, it\n forms itself into a mass and glows from the intense friction; and it takes the\n colours nearest to white from the sun higher up, but the greenish shades from\n resemblance to the cloud just above it. The same thing usually happens with the\n sea, where the waters that dash upon the shore are white, and those further out\n without any admixture are blue.\n \n ",
                "29":" And since the rainbow is an indication of a\n change of weather (as I have said), from sunny skies bringing up masses of\n clouds, or on the contrary changing an overcast sky to one that is calm and pleasant, we often read in the poets that Iris is sent from\n heaven when it is necessary to change the present condition of affairs. There\n are many other different opinions, which it would be superfluous to enumerate\n at present, since my narrative is in haste to return to the point from which it\n digressed.\n \n ",
                "30":" For these and similar reasons the emperor\n wavered between hope and fear, since the severity of winter was drawing near\n and attacks were to be looked for in that trackless region, while also he\n feared mutiny of the exasperated soldiers. Besides this, his anxious mind was\n tormented by the thought that when, so to speak, the door of a rich house was\n open before him, he was returning without success.\n \n ",
                "31":" Therefore abandoning his fruitless attempt,\n he returned to Syria, purposing to winter in Antioch, having suffered severely\n and grievously; for the losses which the Persians had inflicted upon him were\n not slight but terrible and long to be lamented. For it had happened, as if\n some fateful constellation so controlled the several events, that when\n Constantius in person warred with the Persians, adverse fortune always attended\n him. Therefore he wished to conquer at least through his generals, which, as we\n recall, did sometimes happen.\n "

So the commander of the cavalry, just now so\n haughty and self-confident, following another's behest, was set upon the first\n horse that could be found and brought before the emperor like a base captive,\n scarcely keeping his wits through terror.

                "7":" But\n when at first sight of Julian he saw that the opportunity was given him of\n bowing down to the purple, taking heart at last and no longer in fear for his\n life, he said: Incautiously and rashly, my Emperor, you have trusted\n yourself with a few followers to another's territory. To which\n Julian replied with a bitter smile: Reserve these wise words for\n Constantius, for I have offered you the emblem of imperial majesty, not as\n to a counsellor, but that you might cease to fear. \n \n "

And advancing with rapid steps, he had no sooner come near the\n suburbs, which were large and extended to a great distance, than a crowd of\n soldiers and people of all sorts, with many lights, flowers, and good wishes,\n escorted him to the palace, hailing him as Augustus and Lord.

But with the dawn of the third day,\n impatient of delay, he hastened along the public highways, and since no one\n ventured to oppose him, placed a force in the pass of Succi, and\n entrusted its defence to Nevitta, as a faithful officer.

On the one side they are near to the midlands of\n Dacia and to Serdica, on the other they look\n down upon Thrace and Philippop- olis, great and famous cities; and as if nature\n had fore-knowledge that the surrounding nations must come under the sway of\n Rome, the pass was purposely so fashioned that in former times it opened\n obscurely between hills lying close together, but afterwards, when our power\n rose to greatness and splendour, it was opened even for the passage of carts;\n and yet it could sometimes be so closed as to check the attempts of great\n leaders and mighty peoples.

But the opposite\n side, over against Thrace, precipitous and falling sheer downward, is made\n difficult on both sides by rough paths, and is hard to get over even when there\n is no opposition. At the foot of these heights on both sides lie spacious\n plains, the upper one extending as far as the Julian Alps, the other so flat and open that there is\n no hindrance to its habitation as far as the strait and the Propontis.\n \n ",

                "7":" Then he passed on to abuse the memory of\n Constantine as an innovator and a disturber of the ancient laws and of customs\n received of old, openly charging that he was the very first to advance\n barbarians even to the rods and robes of consuls. In so doing he showed neither\n good taste nor consideration; for instead of avoiding a fault which he so\n bitterly censured, he himself soon afterwards joined to Mamertinus as colleague\n in the consulship Nevitta, a\n man neither in high birth, experience, nor renown comparable with those on whom\n Constantine had conferred the highest magistracy, but on the contrary\n uncultivated, somewhat boorish, and (what was more intolerable) cruel in his\n high office.\n "

Having\n arranged the plot by secret conferences and added to its strength by profound\n silence, on arriving at Aquileia, a well-situated and prosperous city,\n surrounded by strong walls, with hostile intent they suddenly closed its gates,\n supported in this revolt by the native population, because of the dread which\n was even then connected with the name of Constantius. \n ",

                "4":" And since now nothing was looked for\n except battle, both sides refreshed themselves with food and sleep; at daybreak\n the sound of the trumpets roused them to slay one another, and raising a shout\n they rushed to battle with more boldness than discretion.\n ",
                "5":" Then the besiegers, pushing before them\n mantlets and closely-woven hurdles, advanced slowly and cautiously, and with a\n great number of iron tools tried to undermine the walls. Many carried scaling-\n ladders made to match the height of the walls, but when they could all but\n touch the ramparts, some were crushed by stones that were hurled down upon\n them, others were pierced with whizzing darts; and as the survivors gave way,\n they carried with them all the rest, whom fear of a like fate turned from their\n purpose of fighting. ",
                "6":" This first encounter\n raised the courage of the besieged, who felt confident of still greater\n success, and made light of what remained to do; with settled and resolute minds\n they placed artillery in suitable places and with unwearied labour kept guard\n and attended to other measures of safety. ",
                "7":" On\n the other side the assailants, though anxious and fearful of danger, yet from\n shame of seeming spiritless and slack, seeing that assault by open force\n effected little, turned to the devices of the besiegers' art. And since a\n suitable place could nowhere be found for moving up rams, for bringing engines\n to bear, or for digging mines, the fact that the river Natesio flows by the city only a short\n distance off suggested a device as worthy of admiration as those of old.\n ",
                "8":" With eager speed they built wooden towers\n higher than the enemy's ramparts and placed each upon three\n ships strongly fastened together. On these stood armed men, who, with forces\n gathered from near at hand strove with combined and equal courage to dislodge\n the defenders; and below, light-armed skirmishers issued forth from the lower\n rooms of the towers and threw out little bridges, which they had made\n beforehand, and hastened to cross on them. Thus they worked in unison, in order\n that while those stationed above on both sides assailed each other in turn with\n missiles and stones, those who had crossed by the bridges might without\n interference tear down a part of the wall and open an approach into the heart\n of the city. \n ",

When by the rapidly spreading fire and the weight\n of the men who stood precariously upon them the towers toppled and fell into\n the river, some of the soldiers were killed on their very tops, pierced by\n missiles from the distant engines.

                "10":" Meanwhile\n the foot-soldiers, left alone after the death of their companions on the ships,\n were crushed by huge stones, except a few whom speed of foot through the\n encumbered passageways saved from death. Finally, after the conflict had lasted\n until evening, the usual signal for retreat was given; whereupon both sides\n withdrew and spent what remained of the day with different feelings. ",
                "11":" For the laments of the besiegers, as they grieved\n for the death of their comrades, encouraged the defenders to hope that they were now getting the upper hand, although they, too, had\n a few losses to mourn. Yet, in spite of this, no time was lost, and after a\n whole night, during which enough food and rest to recover their strength was\n allowed, the battle was renewed at daybreak at the sound of the trumpet.\n ",
                "12":" Then some with their shields raised over\n their heads, to be less hampered in fighting, others carrying ladders on their\n shoulders as before, rushed forward in fiery haste, exposing their breasts to\n wounds from many kinds of weapons. Still others tried to break the iron bars of\n the gates, but were assailed in their turn with fire or slain by great stones\n hurled from the walls. Some, who boldly tried to cross the moat, taken unawares\n by the sudden onslaughts of those that secretly rushed forth through the\n postern gates, either fell, if overbold, or withdrew wounded. For the return to\n the walls was safe and a rampart before the walls covered with turf protected\n from all danger those who lay in wait. \n ",
                "13":" But although the besieged, who had no help\n other than that of the walls, excelled in endurance and the arts of war, yet\n our soldiers, selected from the better companies, unable to bear the long\n delay, went about all the suburbs, diligently seeking for places where they\n could force an entrance into the city by main strength or by their artillery.\n ",
                "14":" But when this proved impossible,\n prevented by the greatness of the difficulties, they began to conduct the siege\n with less energy, and the garrison troops, leaving behind only the sentinels\n and pickets, ransacked the neighbouring fields, got an\n abundance of all suitable things, and gave their comrades a large share of\n their plunder; and in consequence, by drinking immoderately and stuffing\n themselves with rich food, they lost their vigour.\n \n ",
                "15":" When Julian, who was still wintering in\n Constantinople, heard from the report of Immo and his colleagues what had\n happened, he devised a shrewd remedy for the troubles; he at once sent Agilo,\n commander of the infantry, who was well known at that time, to Aquileia, hoping\n that the sight of so distinguished a man, and the announcement through him of\n Constantius' death, might put an end to the blockade.\n \n ",
                "16":" Meanwhile, that the siege of Aquileia might\n not be interrupted, it was decided, since all the rest of their toil had come\n to nothing, to force a surrender of the vigorous defenders by thirst. And when\n the aqueducts had been cut off, but in spite of that they resisted with still\n greater confidence, with a mighty effort the river was turned from its course;\n but that also was done in vain. For when the means of drinking more greedily\n were diminished, men whom their own rashness had beleaguered lived frugally,\n and contented themselves with water from wells.\n \n ",
                "17":" While these events were taking place with\n the results already told, Agilo (as he was ordered) came to them, and covered\n by a close array of shields drew near confidently; but after giving a detailed\n and true account of the death of Constantius and the establishment of Julian's\n rule, he was overwhelmed with endless abuse as a liar. And no one believed his\n account of what had happened until he was admitted alone\n within the walls under a pledge of safe conduct and repeated what he had said,\n adding a solemn oath that it was true. ",
                "18":" When\n this was heard, the gates were opened, and after their long torment all poured\n forth and gladly met the peace-making general. Trying to excuse themselves,\n they presented Nigrinus as the author of the whole outrage, along with a few\n others, asking that by the execution of these men the crime of treason and the\n woes of their city might be expiated.

                "19":"\n Finally, a few days later, after the affair had been more thoroughly\n investigated before Mamertinus, the praetorian prefect, then sitting in\n judgement, Nigrinus as the chief instigator of the war was burned alive. But\n after him Romulus and Sabostius, senators of Aquileia, being convicted of\n having sown the seeds of discord without regard to its dangerous consequences,\n died by the executioner's sword. All the rest, whom compulsion, rather than\n inclination, had driven to this mad strife, escaped unpunished. For so the\n emperor, naturally mild and merciful, had decided on grounds of justice.\n \n ",
                "20":" Now these things happened later. But Julian\n was still at Naessus, beset by deep cares, since he feared many dangers from\n two quarters. For he stood in dread lest the soldiers besieged at Aquileia\n should by a sudden onset block the passes of the Julian Alps, and he should\n thus lose the provinces and the support which he daily expected from them.\n ",
                "21":" Also he greatly feared the forces of the\n Orient, hearing that the soldiers dispersed over Thrace had been quickly\n concentrated to meet sudden violence and were approaching\n the frontiers of Succi under the lead of the count Martianus. But in spite of\n this he himself also, acting with an energy commensurate with the pressing mass\n of dangers, assembled the Illyrian army, reared in the toil of Mars and ready\n in times of strife to join with a warlike commander. ",
                "22":" Nor did he at so critical a time disregard the interests of private\n persons, but he gave ear to their suits and disputes, especially those of the\n senators of the free towns, whom he was much inclined to favour, and unjustly\n invested many of them with high public office. ",
                "23":" There it was that he found Symmachus and Maximus, two distinguished senators, who had been sent by the\n nobles as envoys to Constantius. On their return he received them with honour,\n and passing over the better man, in place of Tertullus\n made Maximus prefect of the eternal city, to please Rufinus Vulcatius,\n whose nephew he knew him to be. Under this\n man's administration, however, there were supplies in abun- dance, and the\n complaints of the populace, which were often wont to arise, ceased altogether.\n ",
                "24":" Then, to bring about a feeling of\n security in the crisis and to encourage those who were submissive, he promoted\n Mamertinus, the pretorian prefect in Illyricum, to the consulship, as well as\n Nevitta; and that too although he had lately beyond measure blamed Constantine\n as the first to raise the rank of base foreigners. \n \n "

                "1":" But in\n this state of indecision he was kept back by many delays, since the Persian\n king was waiting on the other side of the Tigris until the signs from heaven\n should warrant a move; for if Sapor had crossed the river and found no one to\n oppose him, he could easily have penetrated to the Euphrates; besides this,\n since he was keeping his soldiers in condition for civil war, he feared to\n expose them to the dangers of an attack upon a walled city, knowing by\n experience the strength of its fortifications and the energy of its\n defenders.\n \n ",
                "2":" However, in order not to be wholly inactive,\n nor be criticised for slackness, he ordered Arbitio and Agilo, commanders of\n the cavalry and of the infantry, to sally forth promptly with strong forces,\n not with a view of provoking the Persians to battle, but to draw a cordon on\n our bank of the Tigris and be on the watch to see where the impetuous king\n might break through.

But the scouts and deserters who appeared from time to\n time brought conflicting accounts, being uncertain what would happen, because\n among the Persians plans are communicated to none save the grandees, who are\n reticent and loyal, and with whom among their other gods Silence is honoured.\n \n ",

If anything of the kind was bruited abroad, he gave himself up to\n inquisitions with more eagerness than humanity, and appointed for such trials\n merciless judges; and in the punishment of some he tried to make their death\n lingering, if nature allowed, in some particulars being even more ruthless than\n Gallienus in such inquisitions.

And as sparks flying from a dry forest even\n with a light breeze of wind come with irresistible course and bring danger to\n rural villages, so he also from trivial causes roused up a\n mass of evils, unlike that revered prince Marcus, \n who, when Cassius had mounted to imperial heights in Syria, and a packet of\n letters sent by him to his accomplices had fallen into the emperor's hands\n through the capture of their bearer, at once ordered it to be burned unopened,\n in order that, being at the time still in Illyricum, he might not know who were\n plotting against him, and hence be forced to hate some men against his will.\n \n ",

Therefore, in lawless and\n impious plans, such as Caesar followed, there could be no happiness.\n Happier, in my judgement, was Camillus in exile than was Manlius at that same time,\n even if (as he had desired) he had succeeded in making himself king. \n \n ",

And since throngs of bishops hastened hither and\n thither on the public post-horses to the various synods, as they call them,\n while he sought to make the whole ritual conform to his own will, he cut the\n sinews of the courier-service.\n \n ",

Of these,\n only a small part live on the fruits of the earth; all the rest roam over\n desert wastes, which never knew plough nor seeds, but are rough from neglect\n and subject to frosts; and they feed after the foul manner of wild beasts.\n Their dear ones, their dwellings, and their poor belongings they pack upon\n wains covered with the bark of trees, and when the fancy takes them they change\n their abode without trouble, wheeling their carts to the place which has\n attracted them.\n \n ",
                "42":" But when we have come to another bend,\n abounding in harbours, which forms the last part of the curve of the bow, the\n island of Peuce juts forth, and around\n this dwell the Trogodytae, the Peuci, and other lesser tribes.

A certain man with great vehemence charged an enemy of his, with whom\n he was at bitter odds, of being guilty of high treason; and when the emperor\n ignored it, he repeated the same charge day after day. At last, on being asked\n who it was that he accused, he replied that it was a wealthy citizen.

Whereupon Julian, wearied and disgusted\n with the man's conduct, seeing his treasurer nearby, said to him: Have a\n pair of purple shoes given to this dangerous chatterbox, to take to his\n enemy (who he says, so far as I can understand, has had a cloak of that\n colour sewn for him), in order that he may be able to learn what\n insignificant rags amount to without great power. \n \n \n ",

                "1":" Between two posts along, strong iron baris\n fastened, and projects like a great ruler; from its smooth, rounded surface,\n which in the middle is highly polished, a squared staff extends to a\n considerable distance, hollowed out along its length with a narrow groove, and\n bound there with a great number of twisted cords. To this two wooden rollers\n are very firmly attached, and near one of them stands the gunner who aims the\n shot. He carefully places in the groove of the projecting iron bar a wooden\n arrow, tipped with a great iron point. When this is done, strong young men on\n both sides quickly turn the rollers and the cords. ",
                "2":" When its point has reached the outermost ropes, the arrow, driven by\n the power within, flies from the ballista out of sight, sometimes emitting sparks because of the excessive heat.\n And it often happens that before the weapon is seen, the pain of a mortal wound\n makes it felt.\n \n ",
                "3":" The scorpion, which is now-a-days called the\n wild ass, has the following form. Two posts of oak or holm-oak are hewn out and\n slightly bent, so that they seem to stand forth like humps. These are fastened\n together like a sawing-machine and bored through on both sides with fairly\n large holes. Between them, through the holes, strong ropes are bound, holding\n the machine together, so that it may not fly apart. ",
                "4":" From the middle of these ropes a wooden arm rises obliquely, pointed\n upward like the pole of a chariot, and is twined around with cords in\n such a way that it can be raised higher or depressed. To the top of this arm,\n iron hooks are fastened, from which hangs a sling of hemp or iron. In front of\n the arm is placed a great cushion of hair-cloth stuffed with fine chaff, bound\n on with strong cords, and placed on a heap of turf or a pile of sundried\n bricks; for a heavy machine of this kind, if placed upon a stone wall, shatters\n everything beneath it by its violent concussion, rather than by its weight.\n ",
                "5":" Then, when there is a battle, a round\n stone is placed in the sling and four young men on each side turn back the bar\n with which the ropes are connected and bend the pole almost flat. Then finally\n the gunner, standing above, strikes out the pole-bolt, which holds the\n fastenings of the whole work, with a strong hammer, thereupon the pole is set\n free, and flying forward with a swift stroke, and meeting the soft hair-cloth,\n hurls the stone, which will crush whatever it hits. ",
                "6":" And the machine is called tormentum as all\n the released tension is caused by twisting ( torquetur );\n and scorpion, because it has an upraised sting; modern times have given it the\n new name onager, because when wild asses are pursued by\n hunters, by kicking they hurl back stones to a distance, either crushing the\n breasts of their pursuers, or breaking the bones of their skulls and shattering\n them.\n \n ",
                "7":" Now we shall come to the ram. A tall fir or\n mountain ash is selected, to the end of which is fastened a long, hard iron;\n this has the appearance of a projecting ram's head, and it is this shape which\n has given the machine its name. This is suspended between\n ironbound beams running across on both sides, so that it hangs from a third\n beam like the pan of a balance. Then a number of men, as great as the length of\n the pole permits, draw it back and then shove it forward again with powerful\n blows, just as a ram charges and retreats, to break everything in its way. As\n this is renewed with the force of a repeated stroke of lightning, buildings are\n cracked and shattered as the structure of their walls is destroyed. ",
                "8":" If this kind of engine is worked with full vigour,\n the strongest cities, after their walls have been stripped of defenders, are\n laid open, and the siege is thus brought to an end.\n \n ",
                "9":" In place of these devices of rams, which,\n because they are now so frequent, are in less esteem, a machine is made, well\n known to the historians, which we Greeks call helepolis. It was through the constant\n employment of this engine that Demetrius, the son of King Antigonus, after\n taking Rhodes and other cities gained the name of Poliorcetes. \n ",
                "10":" It is built in the following manner: a huge\n mantlet is constructed of strong planks of great\n length fastened together with iron nails, and covered with ox-hides and hurdles\n of green twigs; and over these is spread mud, in order to protect it from fire\n and falling missiles. ",
                "11":" On its front side are\n set very sharp, three-pronged spear-points,\n of the form which our painters and sculptors give to\n thunderbolts, made heavy with iron weights, so that whatever it attacks it\n shatters with the projecting points. ",
                "12":" This\n powerful mass is guided by numerous soldiers within by means of wheels and\n ropes, and by their united efforts is brought up to the weaker part of the\n walls; and unless the strength of the defenders above is too great, it shatters\n the walls and opens great breaches.\n \n ",
                "13":" But fire-darts (a kind of missile) are made\n in this form: the shaft is of reed, and between this and the point is a\n covering of bands of iron; it looks like a woman's distaff for making linen\n threads. It is skilfully hollowed out on the lower side with many openings, and\n in the cavity fire and some inflammable matter are placed. ",
                "14":" And if it is shot slowly from a somewhat loose bow\n (for it is extinguished by too swift a flight) and has stuck anywhere, it burns\n persistently, and water poured upon it rouses the fire to still greater heat;\n and there is no way of extinguishing it except by sprinkling it with dust.

Whereupon all the people turned\n their heads about and then fled in all directions, to avoid the arrows that\n were showered upon them from the citadel. Thus the city was set on fire, and\n many people who were carelessly wandering about, as in time of peace, were\n butchered; neighbouring places were burned and devastated, and the enemy, laden\n with plunder, returned home without the loss of a single man.

",
                "4":" But the emperor, disregarding\n his cautious counsellor, pushed confidently on, since no human power or virtue\n has ever been great enough to turn aside what the decrees of fate had ordained.\n Immediately upon crossing the bridge he ordered it to be destroyed, so that no\n soldier in his own army might entertain hope of a return.

But on the day after the wretched man had been executed\n another fleet arrived, as he had promised, bringing an abundance of\n supplies.\n \n ",

Elated by this omen, as if he now had surer hope\n of a successful outcome, the emperor pushed on with proud confidence, but since\n the breeze of fortune is uncertain, the result turned out otherwise; for the\n death of a king was foretold, but of which king was uncertain.

                "9":" However, the Etruscan soothsayers, who\n accompanied the other adepts in interpreting prodigies, since they were not\n believed when they often tried to prevent this campaign, now brought out their\n books on war, and showed that this sign was adverse and prohibitory to a prince\n invading another's territory, even though he was in the right. ",
                "10":" But they were spurned by the opposition of the\n philosophers, whose authority was then highly valued, but who were sometimes in\n error and very persistent in matters with which they had little acquaintance.\n They, indeed, advanced as a specious argument for establishing belief in their\n knowledge, that when the former Caesar Maximianus was\n already on the point of engaging with Narseus, king of the Persians, in the\n same way a lion and a huge boar that had been killed were brought to him, and\n that he came back safely after conquering the enemy. And there was no idea at\n all that such a portent threatened destruction to the invader of another's\n territory, although Narseus had first seized Armenia, which was subject to\n Roman jurisdiction.

                "12":" Upon seeing this, Julian again called in\n the interpreters of omens, and on being questioned they declared emphatically\n that this sign also forbade the expedition, pointing out that the thunderbolt\n was of the advisory kind; for so those are\n called which either recommend or dissuade any act. And so much the more was it\n necessary to guard against this one. because it killed a soldier of lofty name\n as well as war-horses, and because places which were struck\n in that manner—so the books on lightning declare— must neither be looked upon nor trodden.

                "13":" The philosophers, on the other hand, maintained that\n the brilliance of the sacred fire which suddenly appeared signified nothing at\n all, but was merely the course of a stronger mass of air sent downward from the\n aether by some force; or if it did give any sign, it foretold an increase in renown for the emperor, as he was beginning a glorious\n enterprise, since it is well known that flames by their very nature mount on\n high without opposition.\n \n ",
                "14":" So when the bridge had been broken down (as\n was said before) and all had crossed, the emperor thought that the most urgent\n of all his duties was to address the soldiers, who were advancing confidently\n through trust in themselves and their leader. Therefore, when the signal had\n been given with the trumpets, and all the centuries, cohorts and maniples had\n come together, he took his place upon a mound of earth, surrounded by a ring of\n high officials, and with calm countenance and favoured with the unanimous\n devotion of all, spoke as follows:\n \n ",
                "15":"\n Seeing the great vigour and eagerness that animate you, my valiant\n soldiers, I have resolved to address you, in order to explain in full detail\n that this is not the first time—as some evil-minded men mutter—that the\n Romans have invaded the Persian kingdom. For not to mention Lucullus and\n Pompey, who, passing through the Albani and the Massagetae, whom we now call\n the Alani, broke into this nation also and came to the Caspian Sea, we know\n that Ventidius, the lieutenant-general of Antony, inflicted\n innumerable sanguinary defeats in this region. But to leave ancient times, I will disclose what recent history\n has transmitted to us. Trajan, Verus, and Severus returned from here\n victorious and adorned with trophies, and the younger Gordianus,\n whose monument we just now looked\n upon with reverence, would have come back with equal glory, after\n vanquishing the Persian king and putting him to flight at Resaina, had he not been struck down by an impious wound\n inflicted by the faction of Philippus, the praetorian prefect, and a few\n wicked accomplices, in the very place where he now lies buried. But his\n shade did not long wander unavenged, for as if their deeds were weighed in\n the scales of Justice, all who had conspired against him perished by\n agonising deaths. \n Those emperors, indeed, their own desire,\n inclined as they were to lofty enterprises, drove to undertake noteworthy\n exploits, but we are urged on to our present purpose by the pitiful fate of\n recently captured cities, by the unavenged shades of armies destroyed, by\n the great disasters that have been suffered, and by the loss of many a camp.\n For everybody's desires are one with ours to make good the past and give\n strength to our country by making this side of her domain safe, and thus\n leave to future generations material for singing our praises. Everywhere shall I, with the help of the eternal\n deity, be by your side, as emperor, as leader, and as fellow horseman, and (as I think) under favourable auspices. But if fickle\n fortune should overthrow me in any battle, I shall be content with having\n sacrificed myself for the Roman world, after the example\n of the Curtii and Mucii of old and the noble family of the Decii. We must wipe out a most mischievous nation, on whose\n sword-blades the blood of our kinsmen is not yet dry. Our forefathers spent many ages in eradicating\n whatever caused them trouble. Carthage was conquered in a long and difficult\n war, but our distinguished leader feared that she might survive the victory. Scipio utterly destroyed\n Numantia, after undergoing many vicissitudes in its\n siege. Rome laid Fidenae low, in order\n that no rivals of her power might grow up, and for that same reason crushed\n Falerii and Veil; and even trustworthy\n ancient histories would have difficulty in convincing us that those cities\n were ever powerful. \n This I have set forth from my knowledge\n of ancient records; it remains for each of you, putting aside the desire for\n plunder, which has often tempted the Roman soldier, to keep with the army on\n its march, and when battle must be joined, to follow each his own standard,\n remembering that if anyone falls behind, he will be left hamstrung. For I fear nothing, save the craft and treachery of the\n over-cunning enemy. Finally, I promise\n one and all that when, after this, affairs shall be\n brought to a successful conclusion, waiving all prior rights of princes, who\n by reason of their full powers think that whatever they have said or\n resolved is just, I will give to anyone who demands it an account of what\n has been rightly or wrongly undertaken. \n Therefore rouse, I pray you, at once rouse your courage, both in the\n anticipation of great success, since you will undergo whatever difficulty\n arises on equal terms with me, and with the conviction that victory must\n always attend the just cause. \n \n \n ",
                "16":" After the speech had been brought to this\n most welcome conclusion, the warriors, exulting in the fame of their leader,\n and still more greatly fired with the hope of success, lifted their shields on\n high and cried that nothing would be dangerous or difficult under a leader who\n imposed more toil upon himself than on the common soldiers. ",
                "17":" In particular, the Gallic troops showed this feeling\n by joyful shouts, remembering how often under his command, and as he ran about\n from company to company, they had seen some nations overcome and others reduced\n to entreaties.\n "

On the west it touches Armenia, Niphates, the Asiatic Albani, the Red Sea, and the Scenitic Arabs, whom men of later\n times called the Saracens. Under the\n southern heaven it looks down on Mesopotamia. Opposite the eastern front it extends to the Ganges river, which\n cuts through India and empties into the southern ocean.\n \n ",

And it is said that, after this same statue had been\n carried off and the city burned, the soldiers in ransacking the temple found a\n narrow crevice; this they widened in the hope of finding something valuable;\n but from a kind of shrine, closed by the occult arts of the Chaldaeans, the\n germ of that pestilence burst forth, which after generating the virulence of\n incurable diseases, in the time of the same Verus and of Marcus Antoninus\n polluted everything with contagion and death, from the frontiers of Persia all\n the way to the Rhine and to Gaul. \n \n \n \n ",
                "24":" Near these is the land of the Chaldaeans,\n the foster-mother of the old-time philosophy—as they themselves say—where the\n true art of divination first made its appearance. Now the most important rivers\n that flow through those lands, besides the others that I have mentioned, are\n the Marses, the Royal River, and the Euphrates, greatest of\n all. The last-named divides into three branches, all of which are navigable,\n forms several islands, and often thoroughly waters the fields through the\n diligence of the farmers, and prepares them\n for the ploughshare and for tree-culture.\n \n ",
                "25":" Neighbours to these lands are the Susiani,\n who have few cities. Conspicuous among them, however, is Susa, often the\n residence of the kings, and Arsiana, Sele, and Aracha. The others are small and\n little known. On the other hand, many rivers flow through this region; most\n notable among them are the Oroates, Harax, and Mosaeus, which along the narrow\n sandy tract that separates the Caspian from the Red Sea overflow into a great\n number of pools.\n \n ",
                "26":" On the left Media extends, bordering on the\n Hyrcanian Sea. Of this province we read that\n before the reign of the elder Cyrus and the growth in Persia's power, it was\n the queen of all Asia, after it had overcome Assyria, whose many provinces, changed in\n name to Agropatena, it possessed by the right of conquest. ",
                "27":" It is a warlike nation, and most of all to be feared\n next to the Parthians, by whom alone it is surpassed, and its territory has the\n form of a rectangle. The inhabitants of these lands as a\n whole dwell in a most spacious country, overhung by very lofty mountains, which\n they call Zagrus, Orontes, and Iasonius. \n ",
                "28":" Those who dwell on the western side of the\n lofty mountain Coronus abound in fields of grain and\n vineyards, enjoy the fertility of a productive\n soil, and are rich in rivers and clear springs. ",
                "29":" Their green meadows produce a noble breed of horses, on which their\n chiefs (as the writers of old say, and as I myself have seen) when entering\n battle are wont to ride full of courage. These horses they call Nesaean.\n \n ",
                "30":" Therefore Media abounds in rich cities, in\n villages built up like towns, and in a great number of inhabitants; it is (to\n speak briefly) the richest residence of the kings.\n \n ",
                "31":" In these parts are the fertile fields of the\n Magi, about whose sects and pursuits—since we have chanced on this point—it\n will be in place to give a few words of explanation. According to Plato, the most\n eminent author of lofty ideas, magic, under the mystic name of hagistia, \n is thepurest worship of the gods. To the science of this, derived from\n the secret lore of the Chaldaeans, in ages long past the Bactrian Zoroaster\n made many\n contributions, and after him the wise king Hystaspes, \n the father of Darius. \n ",
                "32":" When Zoroaster had boldly made his way into\n the unknown regions of Upper India, he reached a wooded wilderness, whose calm\n silence the lofty intellects of the Brahmins control. From their teaching he\n learned as much as he could grasp of the laws regulating the movements of the\n earth and the stars, and of the pure sacrificial rites. Of what he had learned\n he communicated something to the understanding of the Magi, which they, along\n with the art of divining the future, hand on from generation to generation to\n later times. ",
                "33":" From that time on for many ages\n down to the present a large class of men of one and the same descent have\n devoted themselves to the service of the gods. The Magi also say (if it is\n right to believe them) that they guard on ever-burning braziers a fire sent\n down from heaven in their country, and that a small portion of it, as a good\n omen, used to be carried before the Asiatic kings. ",
                "34":" The number of Magi of this origin in old times was very small, and\n the Persian potentates made regular use of their services in the worship of\n their gods. And it was sin to approach an altar, or touch a sacrificial victim,\n before one of the Magi, with a set form of prayer, poured the preliminary\n libations. But they gradually increased in number and became a strong clan,\n with a name of their own; they possessed country residences, which were\n protected by no great walls, and they were\n allowed to live in accordance with their own laws, and through respect for\n religion were held in high esteem. ",
                "35":" From this\n seed of the Magi, as the ancient records relate, seven men after the death of\n Cambyses mounted the Persian throne, but (we are told), they\n were overthrown by the party of Darius, who made himself king by the neighing\n of a horse. \n \n \n ",
                "36":" In this neighbourhood the Medic oil is made.\n If a missile is smeared with this oil and shot somewhat slowly from a loosened\n bow (for it is extinguished by a swift flight), wherever it lands it burns\n persistently; and if one tries to put it out with water, he makes it burn the\n more fiercely, and it can be quelled in no other way than by throwing dust upon\n it. \n ",
                "37":" Now, the oil is made in this way. Those who\n are skilled in such matters take oil of general use, mix it with a certain\n herb, and let it stand for a long time and thicken, until it gets magic power\n from the material. Another kind, like a thicker sort of oil, is native to\n Persia, and (as I have said) is called in that\n language naphtha.\n \n ",
                "38":" In these lands are many scattered cities;\n greater than all the rest are Zombis, Patigran and Gazaca. Conspicuous for their\n wealth and their mighty walls are Heraclia, Arsacia, Europos, Cyropolis and Ecbatana, all situated at the foot of Mount\n Iasonius in the land of the Syromedi. \n ",
                "39":" Many streams flow through this country, of\n which the greatest are the Choaspes, Gyndes, Amardus, Charinda, Cambyses, and Cyrus. To this last, a\n great and beautiful river, the elder Cyrus, that lovable king, when he was\n hastening on his way to seize the realms of the Scythians, gave that name in\n place of its older one, because it is valiant, as he himself also was said to\n be, and forcing its way with the exercise of great power, as he did, flows into\n the Caspian Sea.\n \n ",
                "40":" Beyond these tracts, but extending farther\n to the south, next to the seacoast lies Old Persia, rich in small fruits,\n date-palms, and an abundance\n of excellent water. For many rivers flow through it into the above-mentioned\n gulf, the greatest of which are the Batradites, Rogomanius, Brisoana, and Bagrada. ",
                "41":" But the inland cities are the greater -and it is\n uncertain for what reason they built nothing conspicuous along the\n seacoast-notable among which are Persepolis, Ardea, Habroatis,\n and Tragonice. But only three islands are to be seen there: Tabiana, Fara, and\n Alexandria.\n \n ",
                "42":" Near these to the north are the Parthians,\n dwelling in lands abounding in snow and frost. Their land is cut by Choatres\n river, more copious than the rest, and the following cities are more important\n than the others: Oenunia, Moesia, Charax, Apamia,\n Artacana, and Hecatompylos, from which place one reckons along\n the Caspian Sea to the Caspian Gates 1040 stadia. ",
                "43":" There the inhabitants of all the districts are savage and warlike,\n and take such pleasure in war and conflict, that one who loses his life in\n battle is regarded as happy beyond all others. For those who depart from this\n life by a natural death they assail with insults, as degenerate and\n cowardly.\n \n ",
                "44":" On the south-eastern border of these are the\n Happy Arabs, so-called because they are rich in the fruits of the\n field, as well as in cattle, dates, and many varieties of perfumes. A great\n part of their lands border to the right on the Red Sea, and on the left form\n the boundary of the Persian Sea, and the people know how to avail themselves of\n all the advantages of both elements. ",
                "45":" On that\n coast there are both many anchorages and numerous safe harbours, trading cities\n in an uninterrupted line, uncommonly splendid and richly adorned residences of\n their kings, natural hot springs of remarkable curative powers, a conspicuous\n abundance of brooks and rivers, and a very salubrious climate; so that to men\n of good judgement they evidently lack nothing for supreme happiness. ",
                "46":" And while they have an abundance of towns, inland\n and on the coast, as well as fruitful plains and valleys, yet the choicest\n cities are Geapolis and Nascos, Baraba, and also Nagara,\n Maephe, Taphra, and Dioscuris. Moreover, in both seas, and near to the\n shore, there are many islands, which it is not worth while to enumerate. The\n most prominent among them is Turgana, on which there\n is said to be a great temple of Serapis.\n \n ",
                "47":" Beyond the frontier of this people Greater\n Carmania rises with lofty peaks, extending as far as the Indian Sea, supplied\n with products of the soil and fruit trees, but far inferior in fame and in\n extent to the lands of the Arabs; however, the country is no less rich in\n rivers, and equally blest with a fertile soil. ",
                "48":" The rivers better known than the rest are the Sagareus, Saganis, and\n Hydriacus. There are also cities which, though few in number, are very rich in\n all that contributes to the maintenance and enjoyment of life. Conspicuous\n among them are Carmana, mother city of them all, Portospana, Alexandria, and\n Hermupolis.\n \n ",
                "49":" Proceeding inland, one meets with the\n Hyrcanians, whose coast the sea of the same name washes. Among them, since the leanness of their soil kills the\n seeds, less attention is given to agriculture, but they live upon game, of\n which there is a monstrous great variety and abundance. There are also many\n thousand tigers, and numerous other wild beasts, and by what kind of devices\n they are usually taken I recall that I gave an account long ago. \n ",
                "50":" But for all that, they are not unacquainted\n with the plough-tail, but some districts, where the soil is richer, are covered\n over with sown fields. Groves of trees, too, are not lacking\n in places suited for planting them, and many people support themselves by\n commerce on the sea. \n ",
                "51":" Here are two rivers well known by name, the\n Oxus and the Maxera, over which tigers, driven by hunger, sometimes swim and\n unexpectedly cause great losses to the neighbouring places. They also have some\n strong cities, among lesser towns; two are on the sea, Socanda and Saramanna,\n and others inland, Asmurna, Sale, and, better known than these, Hyrcana.\n \n ",
                "52":" Over against this people to the north the\n Abii are said to dwell, a most kindly race, accustomed to trample on all mortal\n things, on whom, as Homer sings as part of his tale, Jupiter looks with favour\n from the mountains of Ida. \n \n \n ",
                "53":" Next after the Hyrcanians the Margiani have\n found homes, a people all but wholly surrounded by lofty hills, and thus\n separated from the sea. And although the greater part of their soil, from\n dearth of water, is a desert, they nevertheless have some towns; but Iasonion,\n Antiochia, and Nigaea\n are better known than the others.\n \n ",
                "54":" The lands next to these the Bactriani\n possess, a nation formerly warlike and very powerful, and always at odds with\n the Persians, until they reduced all the peoples about them to submission and\n incorporated them under their own name. In ancient times they were ruled by\n kings who were formidable even to Arsaces. \n ",
                "55":" Many parts of this land, like Margiana, are\n widely separated from the coast, but rich in vegetation; and the herds which\n graze on their plains and mountains are thickset, with strong limbs, as appears\n from the camels brought from there by Mithridates and seen for the first time\n by the Romans at the siege of Cyzicus. \n ",
                "56":" Several peoples are subject to these same\n Bactrians, notably the Tochari, and like Italy the country is watered by many\n rivers. Of these, the Artamis and Zariaspes first unite, as well as the Ochus\n and Orgomanes, and when joined they increase the mighty flow of the Oxus with\n their combined waters. ",
                "57":" There are also cities here which are laved by other rivers, but\n they recognise these as their betters: namely, Chatracharta, Alicodra, Astatia,\n Menapila, and Bactra itself, from which the kingdom and the nation have derived\n their name.\n \n ",
                "58":" Next the Sogdiani dwell at the foot of the\n mountains which they call the Sogdii, through whose territories two rivers flow\n which are navigable by ships, the Araxates and the Dymas. These streams rush headlong\n over mountains and valleys into a level plain and form a lake, Oxia by name,\n which is both long and broad. Here among other towns Alexandria, Cyreschata,\n and the metropolis,\n Drepsa, are famous.\n \n \n ",
                "59":" Next to these are the Sacae, a tribe of\n savages, inhabiting a rough country rich only for cattle, and hence without\n cities. It is overhung by the mountains Ascanimia and Comedus, along the base\n of which and through a village, which they call Lithinos Pyrgos, a very long road extends, which is the route taken by\n the traders who journey from time to time to the land of the Seres.\n \n ",
                "60":" Along the slopes and at the foot of the\n mountains which they call Imavi and Apurii, various Scythian tribes dwell\n within the Persian territories, bordering on the Asiatic Sarmatians and\n reaching to the outermost side of the Halani. These, as if living in a nook of\n the world, and brought up in solitude, are widely scattered, and are accustomed\n to common and poor food. ",
                "61":" And various other\n tribes dwell in these parts, which at present I think it superfluous to\n enumerate, since I am hastening on to another topic. It is necessary only to\n know, that among these nations, which because of the extreme roughness of their\n land are almost inaccessible, there are some mild and kindly folk, such as the\n Iaxartae and the Galactophagi, whom the bard Homer\n mentions in this verse : \n \n Of the Galactophagi and Abii, righteous men. \n \n \n ",
                "62":" Now, among the many rivers of this land,\n which nature either joins with larger streams or by their own flow carries on\n to the sea, the Rhymmus, Iaxartes and Daicus are celebrated. But there are only\n three cities which the region is known to have, namely, Aspabota, Chauriana,\n and Saga.\n \n \n ",
                "63":" Beyond these lands of both Scythias,\n towards the east, the summits of lofty\n walls form a circle\n and enclose the Seres, remarkable for the richness\n and extent of their country. On the west they are bounded by the Scythians, and\n on the north and the east they extend to a snowclad waste; on the south they\n reach India and the Ganges. There are mountains there, called Anniba,\n Nazavicium, Asmira, Emodon, and Opurocorra. ",
                "64":"\n Through this land, consisting of a plain of wide extent, surrounded\n on all sides by precipitous cliffs, two rivers of famous name, the Oechartis\n and the Bautis, flow in a somewhat\n slow course. The nature of the various tracts is unlike, being now open and\n flat and now descending in gentle slopes; and therefore the land overflows in\n grain, flocks, and orchards. ",
                "65":" On this very\n fruitful soil dwell various peoples, of which the Anthropophagi, Anibi, Sizyges\n and Chardi lie towards the north and the snows. Towards the rising sun are the\n Rabannae, Asmirae, and the Essedones, the most famed of all; close to them, on\n the west, are the Athagorae, and the Aspacarae. In the south are the Baetae,\n dwelling on the slopes of high mountains. They are famed for cities which,\n though not numerous, are large and prosperous; the greatest of these, Asmira,\n Essedon, Asparata, and Sera, are beautiful and well known.\n ",
                "66":" The Seres themselves live a peaceful\n life, for ever unacquainted with arms and warfare; and since to gentle and\n quiet folk ease is pleasurable, they are troublesome to none of their\n neighbours. Their climate is agreeable and healthful, the sky is clear, the\n winds gentle and very pleasant. There is an abundance of well-lighted woods,\n the trees of which produce a substance which they work with frequent\n sprinkling, like a kind of fleece; then from the wool-like material, mixed with\n water, they draw out very fine threads, spin the yarn, and make sericum,\n formerly for the use of the nobility, but nowadays\n available even to the lowest without any distinction. ",
                "67":" The Seres themselves are frugal beyond all others, live a quiet\n life, and avoid intercourse with the rest of mortals. And when strangers, in\n order to buy threads or anything else, cross the river, their wares are laid\n out and with no exchange of words their value is estimated by the eye alone;\n and they are so abstemious, that they hand\n over their own products without themselves getting any foreign ware in\n return.\n \n ",
                "68":" Beyond the Seres live the Ariani, exposed to\n the blasts of the north wind; through their lands flows a river called the\n Arias, large enough to carry ships, which forms a great lake called by the same\n name. Moreover, this same Aria has many cities, among which the following are\n renowned: Vitaxa Sarmatina, Sotira, Nisibis, and Alexandria, from which the\n voyage to the Caspian Sea is reckoned as fifteen hundred stadia.\n \n \n ",
                "69":" Neighbours to these places are the Paro-\n panisadae, facing the Indi on the east, and the Caucasus on the west;\n they themselves also dwell on the slopes of the mountains and through their\n country (besides some smaller rivers) flows the Gordomaris, rising in Bactria.\n And they also have some cities, of which the better-known are Agazaca,\n Naulibus, and Ortospana, from which the distance along the bank of the river to\n the frontiers of Media next to the Caspian Gates is 2200 stadia.\n \n ",
                "70":" Joining the aforesaid are the Drangiani,\n connected with them by hills. Their land is washed by the river Arabius,\n so-called from the place of its rise. Among other towns they are proud\n of two, Prophthasia and Ariaspe, because of their wealth and fame.\n \n ",
                "71":" Then, opposite to these, we see Arachosia,\n on the right facing the Indi. From a much smaller river, flowing out from the\n mighty Indus, from which the whole region takes its name, Arachosia receives an\n abundance of water; this river forms a lake, called Arachotoscrene. Here also among insignificant cities, are Alexandria, Arbaca, and Choaspa.\n \n ",
                "72":" Now far within Persia lies Gedrosia, on the\n right reaching the frontiers of the Indi; it is made fertile by the Artabius,\n in addition to smaller streams. Here the Arbitani mountains come to an end, and from their bases flow other rivers, which mingle\n with the Indus, losing their names through the size of the greater stream. But\n here, too, there are famous cities, in addition to islands; but Ratira and\n Gynaecon limen \n are more highly esteemed than the rest.\n \n ",
                "73":" But we would not give a detailed account of\n the seacoast at the extremities of Persia, and wander too far from our subject.\n So it will be enough to say that the sea extending from the Caspian mountains\n along the northern side to the above-mentioned strait is 9000 stadia; but the\n southern frontier, from the mouths of the river Nile to where Carmania begins,\n is reckoned at 14,000 stadia.\n \n ",
                "74":" Among these many men of differing tongues\n there are varieties of persons, as well as of places. But, to describe their\n bodily characteristics and their customs in general, they are almost all\n slender, somewhat dark, or of a leaden pallor, with eyes grim as goats',\n eyebrows joined and curved in the form of a half-circle, not uncomely beards,\n and long, shaggy hair. All of them without exception, even at banquets and on\n festal days, appear girt with swords; an old Greek custom which, according to\n the trustworthy testimony of Thucydides, the Athenians\n were the first to abandon. ",
                "75":" Most of them are\n extravagantly given to venery, and are hardly contented with a multitude of\n concubines; they are free from\n immoral relations with boys. Each man according to his means contracts many or few\n marriages, whence their affection, divided as it is among various objects,\n grows cold. They avoid as they would the plague splendid and luxurious\n banquets, and especially, excessive drinking. \n ",
                "76":" Except for the kings' tables, they have no\n fixed hours for meal-times, but every man's belly is, as it were, his sundial;\n when this gives the call, they eat whatever is at hand,\n and no one, after he is satisfied, loads himself with superfluous food.\n \n ",
                "77":" They are immensely moderate and cautious, so\n much so that they sometimes march through an enemy's gardens and vineyards\n without coveting or touching anything, through fear of poison or magic arts.\n ",
                "78":" Besides this, one seldom sees a Persian\n stop to pass water or step aside in response to a call of nature; so\n scrupulously do they avoid these and other unseemly actions. ",
                "79":" On the other hand, they are so free and easy, and\n stroll about with such a loose and unsteady gait, that one might think them\n effeminate; but, in fact, they are most gallant warriors, though rather crafty\n than courageous, and to be feared only at long range. They are given to empty\n words, and talk madly and extravagantly. They are boastful, harsh and\n offensive, threatening in adversity and prosperity alike, crafty, haughty,\n cruel, claiming the power of life and death over slaves and commons. They flay\n men alive, either bit by bit or all at once, and no servant who waits upon\n them, or stands at table, is allowed to open his mouth, either to speak or to\n spit; to such a degree, after the skins are spread,\n are the mouths of all fettered. ",
                "80":" They stand in special fear of the laws, among which\n those dealing with ingrates and deserters are particularly severe; and some\n laws are detestable, namely, those which provide that because of the guilt of a\n single person all his relatives are put to death. \n ",
                "81":" For the office of judge, upright men of\n proved experience are chosen, who have little need of advice from others;\n therefore they ridicule our custom, which at times places eloquent men, highly\n skilled in public law, behind the backs of judges without learning. But that one judge was forced to take his seat on the\n skin of another who had been condemned to death for injustice is either a fiction\n of antiquity, or, if once customary, has long since been given up. ",
                "82":" Through military training and discipline, through\n constant exercise in warfare and military manoeuvres, which we have often\n described, they cause dread even to great armies; they rely especially on the\n valour of their cavalry, in which all the nobles and men of rank undergo hard\n service; for the infantry are armed like the murmillones, \n \n and they obey orders like so many horse-boys. The whole throng of them always\n follows in the rear, as if doomed to perpetual slavery, without ever being\n supported by pay or gifts. And this nation, so bold and so well trained for the\n dust of Mars, would have brought many other peoples under the yoke in addition\n to those whom they fully subdued, were they not constantly\n plagued by domestic and foreign wars. ",
                "83":" Most\n of them are so covered with clothes gleaming with many shimmering colours, that\n although they leave their robes open in front and on the sides, and let them\n flutter in the wind, yet from their head to their shoes no part of the body is\n seen uncovered. To the use of golden armlets and neckchains, gems, and\n especially pearls, of which they possess a great number, they first became\n accustomed after their victory over Lydia and Croesus. \n \n \n ",
                "84":" It remains for me to speak briefly about the\n origin of this gem. Among the Indians and the\n Persians pearls are found in strong, white sea-shells, being conceived at a\n definite time of the year by mixture with dew. For at that time they desire, as\n it were, a kind of copulation, and by often opening and shutting quickly they\n take in moisture by sprinkling with moonlight. Thereby becoming pregnant, they\n each bear two or three small pearls, or else uniones, \n so called because the shell-fish, when opened, sometimes yield only one\n pearl, but in that case they are of greater size. ",
                "85":" And it is a proof that they are of ethereal origin, rather than\n that they are conceived and fed from nourishment derived from the sea, that\n when drops of morning dew fall upon these gems, they make them brilliant and\n round, but the dew of evening, on the contrary, makes them irregular, red, and\n sometimes spotted; and they become large or small under varying conditions,\n according to the quality of what they have taken in. Very often the shell-fish close through fear of thunderstorms, and either\n produce imperfect stones or none at all; or at any rate, it melts away as the\n result of abortion. ",
                "86":" Their taking is\n difficult and dangerous, and their price is high, for the reason that they\n avoid shores that are usually frequented, to escape the snares of the\n pearlfishers, as some believe, and hide amid solitary rocks and the lairs of\n sea-hounds. \n ",
                "87":" That this kind of gem is found and gathered\n in the lonely bays of the Britannic Sea, although of less value than these, is well known to us.\n "

He also arranged to have 1500 mounted scouts riding a little\n ahead of the army, who advancing with caution on both flanks, as well as in\n front, kept watch that no sudden attack be made. He himself in the centre led\n the infantry, which formed the main strength of his entire force, and ordered\n Ncvitta on the right with several legions to skirt the banks of the Euphrates.\n The left wing with the cavalry he put in charge of Arintheus and Ormisda, to be led in close\n order through the level fields and meadows. Dagalaifus and Victor brought up\n the rear, and last of all was Secundinus, \n military leader in Osdruena. \n \n \n ",
                "2":" Then in order to fill the enemy (if they\n should burst out anywhere), even when they saw him from afar, with fear of a\n greater force than he had, by a loose order he so extended the ranks of horses\n and men, that the hindermost were nearly ten miles distant from the\n standard-bearers in the van. This is the wonderful device that Pyrrhus, the\n famous king of Epirus, is said often to have used; for he was most skilful in\n choosing suitable places for his camp, and able to disguise the look of his forces\n so that the enemy might think them greater or fewer as it suited him.\n \n ",
                "3":" His packs, servants, unarmed attendants, and\n every kind of baggage he placed between two divisions of the rank and file, in\n order that they might not be carried off (as often happens) by a sudden attack,\n if they were left unprotected. The fleet, although the river along which it\n went winds with many a bend, was not permitted to lag behind or get ahead.\n \n ",
                "4":" After making a march of two days in this\n manner, we approached the deserted city of Dura, situated on the river bank.\n Here so many herds of deer were found, some of which were slain with arrows,\n others knocked down with heavy oars, that all ate to satiety; but the greater\n number of the animals, accustomed to rapid swimming, leaped into the river and\n with a speed that could not be checked escaped to their familiar deserts.\n \n ",
                "5":" Then, after completing a leisurely march of\n four days, just as evening was coming on Count Lucillianus, with a thousand\n light-armed troops embarked in ships, was sent, by the emperor's order, to\n capture the fortress of Anatha, which, like many\n others, is girt by the waters of the Euphrates. The ships, according to orders,\n took suitable positions and blockaded the island, while a misty night hid the\n secret enterprise. ",
                "6":" But as soon as daylight\n appeared, a man who went out to fetch water, suddenly catching sight of the\n enemy, raised a loud outcry, and by his excited shouts called the defenders to\n arms. Then the emperor, who from an elevated point had\n been looking for a site for a camp, with all possible haste crossed the river,\n under the protection of two ships, followed by a great number of boats carrying\n siege-artillery. ",
                "7":" But on drawing near the\n walls he considered that a battle must be accompanied by many dangers, and\n accordingly, partly in mild terms, partly in harsh and threatening language, he\n urged the defenders to surrender. They asked for a conference with Ormizda, and\n were induced by his promises and oaths to expect much from the mercy of the\n Romans. ",
                "8":" Finally, driving before them a\n garlanded ox, which with them indicates the acceptance of peace, they came down\n in suppliant guise. At once the whole fortress was set on fire; Pusaeus, its\n commander, later a general in Egypt, was given the rank of tribune. As for the\n rest, they were treated kindly, and with their families and possessions were\n sent to Chalcis, a city of Syria. ",
                "9":" Among them\n was a soldier who, when in former times Maximianus made an inroad into the\n Persian territory, had been left in these parts because of illness; he was then\n a young man, whose beard was just beginning to grow. He had been given several\n wives (as he told us) according to the custom of the country, and was on our\n arrival a bent old man with numerous offspring. He was overjoyed, having\n advised the surrender, and when taken to our camp, he called several to witness\n that he had known and declared long ago that he, when nearly a hundred years\n old, would find a grave on Roman soil. After this the Saracens, to the\n emperor's great delight, brought in some skirmishers belonging to a division\n of the enemy, and after receiving rewards were sent back\n to engage in like activities.\n \n ",
                "10":" On the following day another thing happened,\n this time a disaster. For a hurricane arose, which stirred up numerous\n whirlwinds and caused such general confusion, that many tents were rent asunder\n and numerous soldiers were prevented by the force of the gale from keeping a\n firm footing and were hurled to the ground on their faces or on their backs. On\n that same day another equally dangerous thing happened. For the river suddenly\n overflowed its banks and some grain-ships were sunk, since the sluices built of\n masonry, which served to hold in or let out the water used for irrigating the\n fields, were broken through; but whether this was a device of the enemy or was\n due to the weight of the waters could not be learned.\n \n ",
                "11":" After storming and burning the first city to\n which we had come, and moving the prisoners to another place, the hopes of the\n army were raised to fuller confidence and with loud shouts they rose to praise\n the prince, convinced that even now the protection of the god of heaven would\n be with them.\n \n ",
                "12":" And for one who was traversing unknown\n regions greater precautions against hidden dangers were necessary, since the\n craft and many wiles of the nation were to be feared. Therefore the emperor,\n with light-armed skirmishers, now took his place at the head of the army, and\n now brought up the rear; and in order that no hidden danger might escape his\n notice, he scanned the rough thickets and valleys, using either his native\n affability or threats to keep his men from scattering too loosely or too far.\n \n ",
                "13":" However, he allowed the enemy's fields,\n abounding in fruits of every kind, to be set on fire with their crops and huts,\n but only after each man had fully supplied himself with everything that he\n needed; and in this way the safety of their foes was impaired before they knew\n it. ",
                "14":" For the warriors gladly made use of what\n they had won with their own hands, thinking that their valour had found new\n granaries; and they were delighted to have\n an abundance of provisions and at the same time save the food that was carried\n in the ships. ",
                "15":" At this place a drunken\n soldier, who had rashly and without orders crossed to the opposite bank, was\n seized by the enemy before our eyes and killed.\n "
            },
            "1":{
                "0":" After these successful operations we reached\n a fortress called Thilutha, situated in the middle of the river, a place rising\n in a lofty peak and fortified by nature's power as if by the hand of man. Since\n the difficulty and the height of the place made it impregnable, an attempt was\n made with friendly words (as was fitting) to induce the inhabitants to\n surrender; but they insisted that such defection then would be untimely. But\n they went so far as to reply, that as soon as the Romans by further advance had\n got possession of the interior, they also would go over to the victors, as\n appendages of the kingdom. ",
                "1":" After this, as our\n ships went by under their very walls, they looked on in\n respectful silence without making any move. After passing this place we came to\n another fortress, Achaiachala by name, also protected by the encircling river,\n and difficult of ascent; there too we received a similar refusal and went on.\n The next day another castle, which because of the weakness of its walls had\n been abandoned, was burned in passing. ",
                "2":" Then\n during the following two days we covered 200 stadia and arrived at a place\n called Baraxmalcha. From there we crossed the river and entered the city of\n Diacira, \n seven miles distant. This place was without inhabitants, but rich in grain and\n fine white salt; there we saw a temple, standing on a lofty citadel. After\n burning the city, and killing a few women whom we found, we passed over a\n spring bubbling with bitumen and took possession of the town of Ozogardana,\n which the inhabitants had likewise deserted through fear of the approaching\n army. Here a tribunal of the emperor Trajan was to be seen. \n ",
                "3":" After burning this city also, and taking two\n days' rest, towards the end of the night which followed the second day, the\n Surena, who among\n the Persians has won the highest rank after the king, and the Malechus,\n Podosaces by name, phylarch of the Assanitic\n Saracens, a notorious brigand, who with every kind of cruelty had long raided\n our territories, laid an ambuscade for Ormizda, who, as they had\n learned (one knew not from what source), was on the point of\n setting out to reconnoitre. But their attempt failed, because the river at that\n point is narrow and very deep, and hence could not be forded. ",
                "4":" At daybreak the enemy were already in sight, and we\n then saw them for the first time in their gleaming helmets and bristling with\n stiff coats of mail; but our soldiers rushed to battle at quick step, and fell\n upon them most valiantly. And although the bows were bent with strong hand and\n the flashing gleam of steel added to the fear of the Romans, yet anger whetted\n their valour, and covered with a close array of shields they pressed the enemy\n so hard that they could not use their bows. ",
                "5":"\n Inspired by these first-fruits of victory, our soldiers came to the village of\n Macepracta, where the half-destroyed traces of walls were seen; these in early times had a wide extent, it was said,\n and protected Assyria from hostile inroads. ",
                "6":"\n Here a part of the river is drawn off by large canals which take the water into\n the interior parts of Babylonia, for the use of the fields and the neighbouring\n cities; another part, Naarmalcha by name, which\n being interpreted means the kings' river, flows past Ctesiphon.\n Where it begins, a tower of considerable height rises, like the Pharos.\n Over this arm of the\n river all the infantry crossed on carefully constructed bridges. ",
                "7":" But the cavalry with the pack-animals swam across in\n full armour where a bend in the river made it less deep and rapid; some of them\n were carried off by the current and drowned, others were \n assailed by the enemy with a sudden shower of arrows; but a troop of\n auxiliaries, very lightly equipped for running, sallied forth, followed hard on\n the backs of the flying foe, and like so many birds of prey, struck them\n down.\n \n ",
                "8":" When this undertaking also had been\n accomplished with glory, we came to the large and populous city of Pirisabora,\n surrounded on all sides by the river. The emperor, after riding up and\n inspecting the walls and the situation, began the siege with all caution, as if\n he wished by mere terror to take from the townsmen the desire for defence. But\n after they had been tried by many conferences, and not one could be moved\n either by promises or by threats, the siege was begun. The walls were\n surrounded by a triple line of armed men, and from dawn until nightfall they\n fought with missiles. ",
                "9":" Then the defenders,\n who were strong and full of courage, spread over the ramparts everywhere loose\n strips of haircloth to check the force of the missiles, and themselves\n protected by shields firmly woven of osier and covered with thick layers of\n rawhide, resisted most resolutely. They looked as if they were entirely of\n iron; for the plates exactly fitted the various parts of their bodies and fully\n protecting them, covered them from head to foot. ",
                "10":" And again and again they earnestly demanded an interview with\n Ormizda, as a fellow countryman and of royal rank, but when he came near they\n assailed him with insults and abuse, as a traitor and a deserter. This tedious\n raillery used up the greater part of the day, but in the first stillness of\n night many kinds of siege-engines were brought to bear and \n the deep trenches began to be filled up. ",
                "11":"\n When the defenders, who were watching intently, made this out by the still\n uncertain light, and besides, that a mighty blow of the ram had breached a\n corner tower, they abandoned the double walls of the city and took possession\n of the citadel connected with them, which stood on a precipitous plateau at the\n top of a rough mountain. The middle of this mountain rose to a lofty height,\n and its rounded circuit had the form of an Argolic shield, except that on the north side, where its roundness\n was broken, cliffs which descended into the current of the Euphrates still more\n strongly protected it. On this stronghold, battlements of walls rose high, and\n were built of bitumen and baked brick, a kind of structure (as is well known)\n than which nothing is safer. ",
                "12":" And now the\n soldiers with greater confidence rushed through the city, seeing it deserted,\n and fought fiercely with the inhabitants, who from the citadel showered upon\n them missiles of many kinds. For although those same defenders were hard\n pressed by our catapults and ballistae, they in turn set up on the height\n strongly stretched bows, whose wide curves extending on both sides were bent so\n pliably that when the strings were let go by the fingers, the iron- tipped\n arrows which they sent forth in violent thrusts crashed into the bodies exposed\n to them and transfixed them with deadly effect. ",
                "13":" Nevertheless both armies fought with clouds of stones thrown by\n hand; neither side gave way, but the hot fight continued with great\n determination from dawn until nightfall, and ended indecisively. Then, on the\n following day, they continued the battle most fiercely, many\n fell on both sides, and their equal strength held the victory in balance.\n Whereupon the emperor, hastening to try every lucky throw amid the mutual\n slaughter, surrounded by a band in wedge-formation, and protected from the fall\n of arrows by shields held closely together, in swift assault with a company of\n vigorous warriors, came near the enemy's gate, which was heavily overlaid with\n iron. ",
                "14":" And although he and those who shared\n in his peril were assailed with rocks, bullets from slings, and other missiles,\n nevertheless he often cheered on his men as they tried to break in the leaves\n of the folding gates, in order to affect an entrance, and he did not withdraw\n until he saw that he must soon be overwhelmed by the volleys that were being\n hurled down upon him. ",
                "15":" After all, he got back\n with all his men; a few were slightly wounded, he himself was unhurt, but bore\n a blush of shame upon his face. For he had read that Scipio Aemilianus,\n accompanied by the historian Polybius of Megalopolis in Arcadia and thirty soldiers, had\n undermined a gate of Carthage in a like attack. But the admitted credibility of\n the writers of old upholds the recent exploit. \n ",
                "16":" For Aemilianus had come close up to the\n gate, and it was protected by an arch of masonry, under which he was safely\n hidden while the enemy were trying to lift off the masses of stone ; and he broke into the city when it\n was stripped of its defenders. But Julian attacked an exposed place, and was\n forced to retreat only when the face of heaven was darkened by fragments of\n mountains and other missiles showered upon him; and then with difficulty.\n \n \n ",
                "17":" These actions went on in haste and\n confusion, and since it was evident that the construction of mantlet-sheds and\n mounds was greatly interfered with by other pressing matters, Julian gave\n orders that the engine called helepolis should quickly be built, by the use of which, as I have\n said above, King Demetrius overcame many cities and won the name of\n Poliorcetes. \n ",
                "18":" To this huge mass, which would rise above\n the battlements of the lofty towers, the defenders turned an attentive eye, and\n at the same time considering the resolution of the besiegers, they suddenly\n fell to their prayers, and standing on the towers and battlements, and with\n outstretched hands imploring the protection of the Romans, they craved pardon\n and life. ",
                "19":" And when they saw that the works\n were discontinued, and that those who were constructing them were attempting\n nothing further, which was a sure sign of peace, they asked that an opportunity\n be given them of conferring with Ormizda. ",
                "20":"\n When this was granted, and Mamersides, commander of the garrison, was let down\n on a rope and taken to the emperor, he obtained (as he besought) a sure promise\n of life and impunity for himself and his followers, and was allowed to return.\n When he reported what he had accomplished, all the people of both sexes, since\n everything that they desired had been accepted, made peace with trustworthy\n religious rites. Then the gates were thrown open and they came out, shouting\n that a potent protecting angel had appeared to them in the person of a Caesar\n great and merciful. ",
                "21":" The prisoners numbered\n only 2500; for the rest of the population, in anticipation of a siege, had crossed the river in small boats and made off. In this\n citadel there was found a great abundance of arms and provisions; of these the\n victors took what they needed and burned the rest along with the place\n itself.\n "
            },
            "2":{
                "0":" The day after these events the serious news\n came to the emperor, while he was quietly at table, that the Persian leader\n called the Surena had unexpectedly attacked three\n squadrons of our scouting cavalry, had killed a very few of them, including one\n of their tribunes, and carried off a standard. ",
                "1":" At once roused to furious anger, Julian hurried forth with an armed\n force,—his safest course lay in his very speed-and routed the marauders in\n shameful confusion; he cashiered the two surviving tribunes as inefficient and\n cowardly, and following the ancient laws, discharged and put to death ten\n of the soldiers who had fled from the field.\n \n ",
                "2":" Then, after the city was burned (as has been\n told), Julian mounted a tribunal erected for the purpose and thanked the\n assembled army, urging them all to act in the same way in the future, and\n promised each man a hundred pieces of silver. But when he perceived that the smallness of the promised sum excited a mutinous uproar, he was roused to deep indignation\n and spoke as follows:\n \n ",
                "3":"\n Behold the Persians, said he, abounding in wealth of\n every kind. The riches of this people can enrich you, if we show ourselves\n brave men of united purpose. But from endless resources (believe me, pray)\n the Roman empire has sunk to extremest want through those men who (to enrich\n themselves) have taught princes to buy peace from the barbarians with gold.\n \n The treasury has been pillaged, cities\n depopulated, provinces laid waste. I have neither wealth nor family\n connections (although I am of noble birth), only a heart that knows no fear;\n and an emperor who finds his sole happiness in the training of his mind will\n feel no shame in admitting an honourable poverty. For the Fabricii too,\n though poor in worldly goods, conducted serious wars and were rich in glory.\n All this you may possess in abundance,\n if you fearlessly follow God's lead and your general's, who will be careful\n (so far as human foresight can provide), and if you act with moderation; but\n if you oppose me and repeat the shameful scenes of former revolts, go to it\n now! I alone, as becomes a commander,\n having reached the end of a career of great deeds, will die standing on my\n feet, indifferent to a life which one little fever may take from me; or at\n any rate I will abdicate, since I have not lived such a life that I cannot\n some time be a private citizen. And I may say with pride and joy that we have with us thoroughly tried generals, perfect in their\n knowledge of every kind of warfare. \n \n \n ",
                "4":" By this address of an emperor self-contained\n amid prosperity and adversity the soldiers were quieted for the time, and,\n gaining confidence through the anticipation of better days, they promised to be\n obedient and compliant. With unanimous applause they lauded his leadership and\n high spirit to the skies; and when such utterances are sincere and come from\n the heart, it is usually shown by a slight clashing of shields. ",
                "5":" After this they retired to their tents and (so far as\n the circumstances allowed) refreshed themselves with food and sleep. It gave\n courage to the army besides that Julian constantly took oath, not by those dear\n to him, but by the great deeds that he planned, saying: As I hope to\n send the Persians under the yoke ; As I hope to restore the\n shattered Roman world. Just as Trajan is said sometimes to have\n emphasized a statement by the oaths: As I hope to see Dacia reduced to\n the form of a province ; As I hope to cross the Hister and the\n Euphrates on bridges ; and many other oaths of the same kind.\n \n ",
                "6":" Next, after a march of fourteen miles, we\n came to a place where the fields are made fertile by an abundance of water; but\n the Persians, having learned in advance that we should take that route, had\n broken the dykes and allowed the water to flow everywhere without restraint.\n ",
                "7":" Therefore, as the ground was covered far\n and wide with standing pools, the emperor gave the soldiers another day of\n rest, and went on himself; and after overcoming many dangers, he made such\n bridges as he could from bladders, as well as boats from the trunks of palm trees, and so got\n his army across, though not without difficulty.\n \n ",
                "8":" In these regions there are many fields,\n planted with vineyards and various kinds of fruits. Here too palm trees are\n wont to grow, extending over a wide expanse as far as Mesene and the great sea, in mighty\n groves. And wherever anyone goes, one constantly sees palm branches with and\n without fruit, \n and from their yield an abundance of honey and wine is made. The palms themselves are said to couple, and the sexes may\n easily be distinguished. \n ",
                "9":" It is also said that the female trees\n conceive when smeared with the seeds of the male, and they assert that the\n trees take pleasure in mutual love, and that this is evident from the fact that\n they lean towards each other, and cannot be parted even by gales of wind. And\n if the female tree is not smeared in the usual way with the seed of the male,\n it suffers abortion and loses its fruit before it is ripe. And if it is not\n known with what male any female tree is in love, her trunk is smeared with her\n own perfume, and the\n other tree by a law of nature is attracted by the sweet odour. It is\n from these signs that the belief in a kind of copulation is created.\n \n \n ",
                "10":" Abundantly supplied with food of that kind,\n our army passed by several islands, and where formerly there was dread of\n scarcity there was now serious danger of over-eating. Finally, they were\n assailed by a hidden attack of the enemy's archers, but not unavenged; and came\n to a place where the main body of the Euphrates is divided into many small\n streams.\n "
            },
            "3":{
                "0":" In this tract a city which, because of its\n low walls, had been abandoned by its Jewish inhabitants, was burned by the\n hands of the angry soldiers. This done, the emperor went on farther, still more\n hopeful because of the gracious aid of the deity, as he interpreted it.\n ",
                "1":" And when he had come to Maiozamalcha, a\n great city surrounded by strong walls, he pitched his tents and took anxious\n precautions that the camp might not be disturbed by a sudden onset of the\n Persian cavalry, whose valour in the open field was enormously feared by all\n peoples. ",
                "2":" After making this provision,\n attended by a few light-armed soldiers and himself also marching on foot,\n Julian planned to make a careful examination of the position of the city; but\n he fell into a dangerous ambuscade, from which he escaped only with difficulty\n and at the risk of his life. ",
                "3":" For through a\n secret gate of the town ten armed Persians came out, and after crossing the\n lower slopes on bended knees made a sudden onslaught on our men. Two with drawn\n swords attacked the emperor, whose bearing made him\n conspicuous, but he met their strokes by lifting up his shield. Thus protected,\n with great and lofty courage he plunged his sword into the side of one\n assailant, while his followers with many a stroke cut down the other. The rest,\n of whom some were wounded, fled in all directions. After stripping the two of\n their arms, Julian returned to the camp with the spoils, bringing back his\n companions uninjured, and was received by all with great joy. ",
                "4":" Torquatus once took from a prostrate foe his golden neck-chain;\n Valerius, \n afterwards surnamed Corvinus, laid low a bold and bragging Gaul with the aid of\n a crow, and by these glorious deeds they gained fame with posterity. We do not\n begrudge the praise; let this fine exploit also be added to the records of the\n past.\n \n ",
                "5":" On the following day bridges were built and\n the army led across, and a camp was measured off in another and more\n advantageous place and girt by a double palisade, since (as I have said) Julian\n feared the open plains. Then he began the siege of the town, thinking that it\n would be dangerous to advance farther, and leave behind him an enemy whom he\n feared.\n \n ",
                "6":" While great preparations were being made for\n the siege, the Surena, who was in command of the enemy, made an attack on the\n pack-animals, which were grazing in the palm-groves; but he was met by our\n scouting-cohorts, and after loss of a few of the men, was baffled by our forces\n and withdrew. ",
                "7":" The inhabitants of two cities,\n which were on islands made by the winding river, alarmed and\n distrustful of their strength, tried to make their way to the walls of\n Ctesiphon; some of them slipped off through the thick woods, others crossed the\n neighbouring pools in their boats made from hollowed trees, thinking this their\n only hope and the best means for making the long journey which confronted them,\n if they were to reach that distant land. ",
                "8":" Some\n of them, who offered resistance, were slain by our troops, who also rushed\n about everywhere in skiffs and boats and from time to time brought in others as\n prisoners. For Julian had provided with balanced care, that while the infantry\n were besieging the town, the cavalry forces, divided into detachments, should\n give their attention to driving off booty; and through this arrangement the\n soldiers, without burdening the provincials at all, fed upon the vitals of the\n enemy.\n \n ",
                "9":" And now the emperor, having surrounded, with\n a triple line of shields, the town,\n which had a double wall about it, assailed it with all his might, in the hope\n of gaining his end. But necessary as the attack was, so was it very difficult\n to bring it to a successful issue. For on every side the approaches were\n surrounded by high and precipitous cliffs and many windings made them doubly\n perilous and the town inaccessible, especially since the towers, formidable for\n both their number and their height, rose to the same elevation as the eminence\n of natural rock which formed the citadel, while the sloping plateau overlooking\n the river was fortified with strong battlements. ",
                "10":" Added to this was an equally serious disadvantage, in that the\n large and carefully chosen force of the besieged could not by any enticements be led to surrender, but resisted as though resolved either\n to be victorious or to die amid the ashes of their native city. But our\n soldiers could with difficulty be kept from the attack, mutinously pressing on\n and demanding a pitched battle even in the open field; and when the trumpet\n sounded the recall, they continually tormented themselves with spirited\n attempts to assail the enemy.\n \n ",
                "11":" However, the judgement of our leaders\n overcame their extreme violence; the work was divided, and each man undertook\n with all speed the task assigned him. For here lofty embankments were being\n raised, there others were filling up the deep ditches; elsewhere long passages\n were being constructed in the bowels of the earth, and those in charge of the\n artillery were setting up their hurling engines, soon to break out with deadly\n roar.

                "12":" Nevitta and Dagalaifus had charge of\n the mines and mantelets; the opening of the attack, and the protection of the\n artillery from fire or sallies was undertaken by the emperor in person.\n And when all the preparations for destroying the city had been completed with\n much painful toil, and the soldiers demanded battle, the general named Victor,\n who had reconnoitred the roads as far as Ctesiphon, returned and reported that\n he had found no obstacles.

                "13":" Upon this all the\n soldiers were wild with joy, and aroused to greater confidence awaited under\n arms the signal for battle.\n \n ",
                "14":" And now, as the trumpets sounded their\n martial note, both sides raised a loud shout. The Romans were the first with\n repeated onslaughts and threatening roars to attack the foe,\n who were covered with plates of iron as if by a thin layer of feathers, and\n were full of confidence since the arrows flew back as they struck the folds of\n the hard iron; but at times the covering of joined shields, with which our men\n skilfully covered themselves as if by the protection of irregularly shaped\n arches, because of their continual movements yawned apart. The Persians, on the\n other hand, obstinately clinging to their walls, tried with every possible\n effort to avoid and baffle the death-dealing attacks. ",
                "15":" But when the besiegers, carrying before them hurdles of wicker\n work, were already threatening the walls, the enemy's slingers and archers,\n others even rolling down huge stones, with torches and fiery shafts tried to keep them at a distance; then ballistae\n adapted for wooden arrows were bent and plied with screaming sound, sending\n forth showers of missiles; and scorpions, hauled to various places by skilled\n hands, hurled round stones. \n ",
                "16":" But after renewed and repeated contests, as\n the heat increased towards the middle of the day and the sun burnt like fire,\n both sides, though intent upon the preparation of the siege-works and eager for\n battle, were forced to retire worn out and drenched with sweat.\n \n ",
                "17":" With the same fixity of purpose, the\n contending parties on the following day also carried on the battle persistently\n with contests of various kinds, and separated on equal terms and with\n indecisive result. But in the face of every danger, the emperor, in closest\n company with combatants, urged on the destruction of the city, lest by\n lingering too long about its walls, he should be forced to abandon his greater\n projects. ",
                "18":" But in case\n of dire necessity nothing is so trifling that it may not at times, even\n contrary to expectation, tip the balance in some great undertaking. For when,\n as often, the combatants were on the point of separating and the fighting\n slackened, a more violent blow from a ram which had shortly before been brought\n up shattered a tower which was higher than all the rest and strongly built of\n kiln-dried brick; and in its fall it carried with it amid a tremendous crash\n the adjacent side of the wall. ",
                "19":" Thereupon,\n according to changes of the situation, the vigour of the besiegers and in turn\n the energy of the besieged was shown by splendid deeds. For nothing seemed too\n hard for our soldiers, inflamed as they were with wrath and resentment, nothing\n was formidable or terrible in the eyes of the defenders as they joined issue\n for their lives. For it was not until the fight had raged for a long time\n without result and blood had been shed in much slaughter on both sides, that\n the close of the day brought it to an end and the combatants then yielded to\n fatigue.\n \n ",
                "20":" While this was going on in the light of day\n and before the eyes of all, it was reported to the emperor, who kept a watchful\n eye on everything, that the legionary soldiers to whom the laying of the mines\n had been assigned, having completed their underground passages and supported\n them by beams, had made their way to the bottom of the foundations of the\n walls, and were ready to sally out when he himself should give the word.\n ",
                "21":" Therefore, although the night was far\n advanced, the trumpets sounded, and at the given signal for \n entering battle they rushed to arms. And, as had been planned, the fronts of\n the wall were attacked on two sides in order that while the defenders were\n rushing here and there to avert the danger, the clink of the iron tools digging\n at the parts close by might not be heard, and that with no hindrance from\n within, the band of sappers might suddenly make its appearance. ",
                "22":" When these matters were arranged as had been\n determined, and the defenders were fully occupied, the mines were opened and\n Exsuperius, a soldier of a cohort of the Victores, leaped out; next came\n Magnus, a tribune and Jovianus, a notary, followed by the whole daring band.\n They first slew those who were found in the room through which they had come\n into daylight; then advancing on tiptoe they cut down all the watch, who,\n according to the custom of the race, were loudly praising in song the justice\n and good fortune of their king. ",
                "23":" It was\n thought that Mars himself (if it is lawful for the majesty of the gods to\n mingle with mortals) had been with Luscinus, when he\n stormed the camp of the Lucanians; and this was believed because in the heat of\n battle an armed warrior of formidable size was seen carrying scaling-ladders,\n and on the following day, when the army was reviewed, could not be found,\n although he was sought for with particular care; whereas, if he had been a\n soldier, from consciousness of a memorable exploit he would have presented\n himself of his own accord. But although then the doer of that noble deed was\n wholly unknown, on the present occasion those who had fought valiantly were\n made conspicuous by gifts of siege-crowns, and according to the\n ancient custom were commended in the presence of the assembled army.\n \n ",
                "24":" At last the city, stripped of its defenders,\n laid open with many breaches and on the point of falling, was entered, and the\n violence of the enraged soldiers destroyed whatever they found in their way,\n without distinction of age or sex; others, in fear of imminent death, being\n threatened on one side by fire, on the other by the sword, shedding their last\n tears voluntarily hurled themselves headlong from the walls, and with all their\n limbs shattered endured for a time a life more awful than death, until they\n were put out of their misery.

                "25":" Nabdates,\n however, the commandant of the garrison, with eighty followers, was dragged out\n alive, and when he was brought before the emperor, who was happy and inclined\n to mercy, orders were given that he be spared unharmed with the others and kept\n in custody.\n Then when the booty was divided according to the estimate of merit and hard\n service, the emperor, being content with little, took only a dumb boy who was\n offered to him, who was acquainted with sign- language and explained many\n things in which he was skilled by most graceful gestures, and was valued at\n three pieces of gold; and this he considered a reward for the victory that\n he had won that was both agreeable and deserving of gratitude. ",
                "26":" But as to the maidens who were taken prisoners (and\n they were beautiful, as is usual in Persia, where the women excel in that\n respect) he refused to touch a single one or even to look on her, following the\n example of Alexander and Africanus, who avoided such conduct, lest those who\n showed themselves unwearied by hardships should be unnerved by passion.\n \n ",
                "27":" In the course of these contests a builder on\n our side, whose name I do not recall, happened to be standing behind a\n scorpion, when a stone which one of the gunners had fitted insecurely to the\n sling was hurled backward. The unfortunate man was thrown on his back with his\n breast crushed, and killed; and his limbs were so torn asunder that not even\n parts of his whole body could be identified.\n \n ",
                "28":" The emperor was on the point of leaving the\n spot, when a trustworthy informant reported that in some dark and hidden pits\n near the walls of the destroyed city, such as are numerous in those parts, a\n band of the enemy was treacherously lying in wait, intending to rush out\n unexpectedly and attack the rear of our army. ",
                "29":" At once a band of foot soldiers of tried valour was sent to dislodge them,\n and when they could neither force an entrance through the openings nor lure to\n battle those hidden within, .they gathered straw and faggots and piled them\n before the entrances of the caves. The smoke from this, becoming thicker the\n narrower the space which it penetrated, killed some by suffocation; others\n scorched by the blast of fires, were forced to come out and met a swift death;\n and so, when all had fallen victims to steel or flame, our men quickly returned\n to their standards. Thus a great and populous city,\n destroyed by Roman strength and valour, was reduced to dust and ruins.\n \n ",
                "30":" After these glorious deeds we passed over a\n series of bridges, made necessary by the union of many streams, and came to two\n fortresses built with special care. Here a son of the Persian king, who had\n come from Ctesiphon with some magnates and an armed force, tried to prevent\n Count Victor, who was leading our van, from crossing the river; but on seeing\n the throng of soldiers that followed, he retreated.\n "

                "1":" There was also in that same region an\n extensive round tract, enclosed by a strong fence and containing the wild\n beasts that were kept for the king's entertainment: lions with flowing manes,\n boars with bristling shoulders, and bears savage beyond all manner of madness\n (as they usually are in Persia), and other choice animals of enormous size; our\n cavalry burst the fastenings of the gates and butchered them all with\n hunting-spears and showers of missiles.

Not far from it is Coche, which they call Seleucia; there a camp was hastily fortified, and the entire army because of the\n convenience of water and fodder rested for two days. But the emperor went on\n ahead with some light-armed skirmishers, in order to visit a deserted city\n destroyed in former days by the emperor Carus ; in this there is an ever\n flowing spring forming a great pool which empties into the Tigris.

For while three cohorts of light-armed skirmishers\n were fighting with a band of Persians which had burst forth from the suddenly\n opened gates of a town, others who had\n sallied forth from the opposite side of the river, cut off and butchered the\n pack-animals that followed us, along with a few foragers who were carelessly\n roaming about.

But only his armour-bearer, who was close at his\n side, was wounded; he himself was protected by a close array of shields, and so\n escaped the great danger and went his way.\n \n ",

                "8":" While this was going on, the Persians, in the same\n way as before, attacked a part of our men from the opposite side of the river,\n killed some, and took a few alive. And from fear, and at the same time because\n they thought that the enemy had gained greater numbers, our men for a time were\n held irresolute; but when they had recovered their courage, had armed\n themselves as well as they could in the confusion, and our army, aroused by the\n trumpets' blast, was hastening to the spot with threatening\n cries, the attacking force retreated in terror, though without loss.

And so\n when he had exposed himself valiantly and long to extreme peril, after using\n every kind of attack and weapons, through the unanimous valour of the besiegers that same\n fortress was at last taken and destroyed by fire.

The calvalry was backed up by companies of infantry, who,\n protected by oblong, curved shields covered with wickerwork and raw hides,\n advanced in very close order.

His\n brother Maurus, later a general in Phoenicia, tried to protect him, and after\n cutting down the man who had killed his brother, he terrified all who came in\n his way, and although he was himself partly disabled by an arrow through his\n shoulder, by main strength he succeeded in bringing off Machameus, already pale\n with approaching death, from the fray.\n \n ",

His guards, who had\n scattered in their alarm, were crying to him from all sides to get clear of the\n mass of fugitives, as dangerous as the fall of a badly built roof, when\n suddenly—no one knows whence —a cavalryman's spear grazed the skin of his arm, pierced\n his ribs, and lodged in the lower lobe of his liver.

Thinking also of this, that the gods of heaven themselves have given\n death to some men of the greatest virtue as their supreme reward. But this gift, I know well, was given to me, that I might not\n yield to great difficulties, nor ever bow down and humiliate myself; for\n experience teaches me that all sorrows overcome only weaklings, but yield to\n the steadfast. I do not regret what I\n have done, nor does the recollection of any grave misdeed torment me; either\n when I was consigned to the shade and obscurity, or after I attained the\n principate, I have preserved my soul, as taking its origin from relationship\n with the gods, stainless (in my opinion), conducting civil affairs with\n moderation, and making and repelling wars only after mature deliberation.\n And yet success and well-laid plans do not always go hand in hand, since\n higher powers claim for themselves the outcome of all enterprises.\n Considering, then, that the aim of a\n just rule is the welfare and security of its subjects, I was always, as you\n know, more inclined to peaceful measures, excluding from my conduct all\n license, the corrupter of deeds and of character. On the other hand, I\n depart rejoicing that, so often as the state, like an imperious parent, has\n exposed me deliberately to dangers, I have stood four-square, accustomed as\n I am to tread under foot the storms of fate. And I shall not be ashamed to admit, that I learned long ago\n through the words of a trustworthy prophecy, that I should perish by the\n sword. And therefore I thank the eternal power that I\n meet my end, not from secret plots, nor from the pain of a tedious illness,\n nor by the fate of a criminal, but that in the mid-career of glorious renown\n I have been found worthy of so noble a departure from this world. For he is\n justly regarded as equally weak and cowardly who desires to die when he\n ought not, or he who seeks to avoid death when his time has come. So much it will be enough to say, since my vital\n strength is failing. But as to the choice of an emperor, I am prudently\n silent, lest I pass over some worthy person through ignorance, or if I name\n someone whom I consider suitable, and perhaps another is preferred, I may\n expose him to extreme danger. But as an honourable foster-child of our\n country, I wish that a good ruler may be found to succeed me. \n \n \n ",
                "14":" After having spoken these words in a calm\n tone, wishing to distribute his private property to his closer friends, as if\n with the last stroke of his pen, he called for Anatolius, his chief\n court-marshal. And when the prefect Salutius replied He has been\n happy, he understood that he had been slain, and he who recently\n with such courage had been indifferent to his own fate, grieved deeply over\n that of a friend.

                "15":" Meanwhile, all who were\n present wept, where- upon even then maintaining his authority, he chided them,\n saying that it was unworthy to mourn for a prince who was called to union with\n heaven and the stars. ",
                "16":" As this made them all\n silent, he himself engaged with the philosophers Maximus and Priscus in an intricate discussion about the nobility of the\n soul. Suddenly the wound in his\n pierced side opened wide, the pressure of the blood checked\n his breath, and after a draught of cold water for which he had asked, in the\n gloom of midnight he passed quietly away in the thirty-second year of his age.\n Born in Constantinople, he was left alone in childhood by the death both of his\n father Constantius (who, after the decease of his brother Constantinus, met his\n end with many others in the strife for the succession to the throne)\n and of his mother Basilina, who came from an old and noble\n family. \n \n "

                "0":" He was a man truly to be numbered with the\n heroic spirits, distinguished for his illustrious deeds and his inborn majesty.\n For since there are, in the opinion of the philosophers, four principal\n virtues, \n moderation, wisdom, justice, and courage and corresponding to these also some\n external characteristics, such as knowledge of the art of war, authority, good\n fortune, and liberality, these as a whole and separately Julian cultivated with\n constant zeal.\n \n ",
                "1":" In the first place, he was so conspicuous for\n inviolate chastity that after the loss of his wife \n it is well known that he never gave a thought to love: bearing in mind what we\n read in Plato, that Sophocles, the tragic poet, when he was\n asked, at a great age, whether he still had congress with women, said no,\n adding that he was glad that he had escaped from this passion as from some mad\n and cruel master. ",
                "2":" Also, to\n give greater strength to this principle, Julian often repeated the saying of\n the lyric poet Bacchylides, whom he delighted to read, who declares that as a\n skilful painter gives a face beauty, just so chastity gives charm to a life of\n high aims. This blemish in the mature strength of manhood he avoided with such\n care, that even his most confidential attendants never (as often happens)\n accused him even of a suspicion of any lustfulness.\n \n ",
                "3":" Moreover, this kind of self-restraint was\n made still greater through his moderation in eating and sleeping, which he\n strictly observed at home and abroad. For in time of peace the frugality of his\n living and his table excited the wonder of those who could judge aright, as if\n he intended soon to resume the philosopher's cloak. And on his various\n campaigns, he was often seen partaking of common and scanty food, sometimes\n standing up like a common soldier. ",
                "4":" As soon as\n he had refreshed his body, which was inured to toil, by a brief rest in sleep,\n he awoke and in person attended to the changing of the guards and pickets, and\n after these serious duties took refuge in the pursuit of learning. ",
                "5":" And if the nightly lamps amid which he worked could\n have given oral testimony, they would certainly have borne witness that there\n was a great difference between him and some other princes, since they knew that\n he did not indulge in pleasure, even to the extent which nature demanded.\n \n ",
                "6":" Then there were very many proofs of his\n wisdom, of which it will suffice to mention a few. He was thoroughly skilled in\n the arts of war and peace, greatly inclined to courtesy, and claiming for himself only so much deference as he thought preserved him\n from contempt and insolence. He was older in virtue than in years. He gave\n great attention to the administration of justice, and was sometimes an\n unbending judge; also a very strict censor in regulating conduct, with a calm\n contempt for riches, scorning everything mortal; in short, he often used to\n declare that it was shameful for a wise man, since he possessed a soul, to seek\n honour from bodily gifts.\n \n ",
                "7":" By what high qualities he was distinguished\n in his administration of justice is clear from many indications: first, because\n taking into account circumstances and persons, he was awe-inspiring but free\n from cruelty. Secondly, because he checked vice by making examples of a few,\n and also because he more frequently threatened men with the sword than actually\n used it. ",
                "8":" Finally, to be brief, it is well\n known that he was so merciful towards some open enemies who plotted against\n him, that he corrected the severity of their punishment by his inborn\n mildness.\n \n ",
                "9":" His fortitude is shown by the great number\n of his battles and by his conduct of wars, as well as by his endurance of\n excessive cold and heat. And although bodily duty is demanded from a soldier,\n but mental duty from a general, yet he once boldly met a savage enemy in battle\n and struck him down, and when our men gave ground,\n he several times alone checked their flight by opposing his breast to them. When destroying the\n king- doms of the raging Germans and on the burning sands of Persia he added to\n the confidence of his soldiers by fighting among the\n foremost. ",
                "10":" There are many notable evidences\n of his knowledge of military affairs: the sieges of cities and fortresses,\n undertaken amid the extremest dangers, the varied forms in which he arranged\n his lines of battle, the choice of safe and healthful places for camps, the\n wisely planned posting of frontier guards and field pickets. ",
                "11":" His authority was so well established that, being\n feared as well as deeply loved as one who shared in the dangers and hardships\n of his men, he both in the heat of fierce battles condemned cowards to\n punishment, and, while he was still only a Caesar, he controlled his men even without\n pay, when they were fighting with savage tribes, as I have long ago said. And\n when they were armed and mutinous, he did not fear to address them and threaten\n to return to private life, if they continued to be insubordinate. ",
                "12":" Finally, one thing it will be enough to know in\n token of many, namely, that merely by a speech he induced his Gallic troops,\n accustomed to snow and to the Rhine, to traverse long stretches of country and\n follow him through torrid Assyria to the very frontiers of the Medes.\n \n ",
                "13":" His success was so conspicuous that for a\n long time he seemed to ride on the shoulders of Fortune herself, his faithful\n guide as he in victorious career surmounted enormous difficulties.

                "14":" There are many undoubted tokens of his generosity. Among these are his very light imposition of\n tribute, his remission of the crown-money, the cancellation of many debts made great\n by long standing, the impartial\n treatment of disputes between the privy purse and private persons, the\n restoration of the revenues from taxes to various states along with their\n lands, except such as previous high officials had alienated by a kind of legal\n sale; furthermore, that he was never eager to increase his wealth, which he\n thought was better secured in the hands of its possessors; and he often\n remarked that Alexander the Great, when asked where his treasures were, gave\n the kindly answer, in the hands of my friends. \n \n \n ",

                "3":" No sooner were these arrangements perfected\n without disturbance than both emperors were seized with violent and lingering\n fevers; but as soon as their hope of life was assured, being more successful m\n investigating various matters than in settling them, they commissioned\n Ursatius, the chief-marshal of the court, a rough Dalmatian, and Viventius of\n Siscia, who was then quaestor, to make a strict\n investigation of what they suspected to be the cause of these diseases.\n Persistent rumour had it, that their purpose was, by asserting that they had\n been harmed by secret sorcery, to rouse hatred of the memory of the emperor\n Julian and his friends. But this charge was easily shown to have nothing in it,\n since no evidence of such plots was found, even in a single word.\n \n \n \n ",
                "4":" At this time, as if trumpets were sounding\n the war-note throughout the whole Roman world, the most savage peoples roused\n themselves and poured across the nearest frontiers. At the\n same time the Alamanni were devastating Gaul and Raetia, the Sarmatae and Quadi\n Pannonia, while the Picts, Saxons, Scots, and Attacotti were harassing the Britons with con- stant disasters. The\n Austoriani and other Moorish tribes raided Africa more fiercely than ever and\n predatory bands of Goths were plundering Thrace and Pannonia. ",
                "5":" The king of the Persians was laying hands on Armenia,\n hastening with mighty efforts to bring that country again under his sway, under\n the false pretext that after the death of Jovian, with whom he had concluded a\n treaty of peace, nothing ought to prevent his recovery of what he claimed had\n formerly belonged to his forefathers.\n "

                "1":" To Valentinian, in accordance with whose\n wish the matter was settled, fell Jovinus, who had\n previously been promoted by Julian to be commander of the cavalry in Gaul, and Dagalaifus, whom\n Jovian had raised to the same rank. But it was arranged that Victor, who had\n also been promoted by the decision of the aforesaid emperor, should follow\n Valens to the Orient, and with him Arintheus was associated. For Lupicinus, who\n also had formerly been made commander of the cavalry by Jovian, was already in\n charge of the eastern provinces. ",
                "2":" At the same\n time Aequitius, who was not yet a\n commander-in-chief, but only a count, was put in charge\n of the army in Illyricum, and Serenianus, who some time before had been retired\n from service, being a Pannonian girded on his sword and was joined with Valens in command\n of a part of the bodyguard. After matters had been thus arranged, the troops\n also were divided between the two emperors.\n \n ",

And being roughly treated by Ursatius, who was then court-marshal, a\n hot-tempered and cruel man, they returned home, and exaggerating what had\n happened, aroused the savage peoples, on the ground that they had been\n grievously insulted.\n \n ",
                "7":" And about that time, or not much later, in\n the Orient Procopius had started a revolution. This and the Alamannic revolt\n were reported to Valentinian on one and the same day about the first of\n November as he was on his way to Paris.\n \n ",
                "8":" Then Valentinian ordered Dagalaifus to go in\n haste to meet the Alamanni, who after devastating places near the frontier had\n withdrawn to a distance without the loss of a man. But as to checking the\n attempt of Procopius before it became ripe, he was distracted by doubt and\n anxiety, being especially troubled because he did not know whether Valens was\n alive or whether his death had led Procopius to aspire to the throne.\n ",
                "9":" For Aequitius knew of the matter only\n from the report of the tribune Antonius, who commanded the soldiers in central\n Dacia and gave a vague account of the affair from that which he himself had\n heard; and Aequitius himself had not yet heard anything trustworthy, and so\n merely reported the circumstance to the emperor in simple words. ",
                "10":" Upon hearing the news, Valentinian, after raising\n the said Aequitius to the rank of a commander-in- chief, decided to go back to Illyricum, lest\n the rebel after rushing through Thrace and being already formidable should\n invade Pannonia with a hostile army. For he was greatly\n alarmed by a recent example, recalling that Julian a short time before, making\n light of an emperor who had\n been victor in all civil wars, contrary to all hope and expectation had passed\n with incredible speed from city to city. ",
                "11":" But\n his eager longing to return was modified by the advice of his confidential\n friends, who advised, nay begged him, not to give up Gaul to the savages who\n threatened destruction, and not under that pretext to abandon provinces which\n needed strong support. These were supported by deputations from famous cities,\n who begged that he should not leave unprotected in such hard and doubtful times\n cities which by his presence he could save from the greatest dangers, since the\n glory of his name would strike fear into the Germans. ",
                "12":" At last, after giving careful thought to what was expedient, he\n followed the view of the majority, often repeating that Procopius was only his\n own and his brother's enemy, but the Alamanni were enemies of the whole Roman\n world; and so he resolved for the present nowhere to leave the boundaries of\n Gaul. ",
                "13":" And having returned as far as Rheims,\n and feeling anxious about Africa, for fear that it might suddenly be invaded,\n he decided that Neoterius, afterwards consul but at that\n time a secretary, should go to protect that province, and also Masaucio, an\n officer of the household troops, bearing in mind that, having had long training\n there under his father, the former Count Cretio, he\n knew all the suspected places; and he joined with them Gaudentius, an officer\n of the targeteers, a loyal man who long had been known to him.\n \n \n ",
                "14":" Because, then, at one and the same time\n lamentable storms arose on both sides, we shall set down the single events in\n their proper place, first giving an account of a part of what took place in the\n Orient, then of the wars with the savages: since most of the events both in the\n west and in the east took place in the same months; for I fear that by\n hastening to return from one place to another by leaps and bounds we might\n confuse everything and involve the course of events in the deepest\n darkness.\n "

            "5":{
                "0":" Procopius was born in Cilicia of a distinguished family and correspondingly\n educated, and for the reason that he was related to Julian, who was afterwards emperor, he was conspicuous from his first\n entry into a public position; and as he was somewhat strict in his life and\n character, although retiring and silent, he served for a long time with\n distinction as state-secretary and tribune, and already had prospects of\n attaining the highest positions. But when after the death of Constantius he\n became through the change in the situation a relative of the emperor,\n he aimed higher and entered the order of counts;\n and it was evident that, if ever he had the opportunity, he would be a\n disturber of the public peace. ",
                "1":" When Julian\n invaded Persia, he left Procopius in Mesopotamia, in association with\n Sebastianus, who was given the same rank, with a strong\n force of soldiers, and ordered him (as rumour\n darkly whispered, for no one vouched for the truth of the report) to act in\n accordance with the conditions that arose, and if he learned that the Roman\n power in Persia was weakened, to take measures quickly to have himself named\n emperor. ",
                "2":" Procopius followed these directions\n with moderation and prudence, but when he learned that Julian had been mortally\n wounded and died, and that Jovian had been raised to the rule of the empire,\n and that the false report was circulated that Julian had with the last breath\n of his failing life declared that it was his wish that Procopius should be\n entrusted with the helm of the state, he feared that on that account he might\n be put to death without a trial. Accordingly, he withdrew from public sight;\n and he was in special fear after the death of Jovianus, the chief of all the\n secretaries, because he had learned that after Julian's death Jovianus had been\n named by a few soldiers as worthy of imperial power, and that from that time on\n he had been suspected of rebellious designs and had suffered a cruel death.\n \n ",
                "3":" And because Procopius had learned that he was\n being tracked with extreme care, in order to avoid the weight of greater hatred\n he retreated to still more remote and secret places. Then hearing that Jovianus\n was diligently hunting for his hiding-places, and being already thoroughly\n wearied of living the life of a wild beast—for being cast down from a lofty\n station to a lower condition and confined to desert places, he actually\n suffered from hunger and was deprived of intercourse with mankind—under the\n compulsion of extreme necessity he came by round-about ways\n to the vicinity of Chalcedon. ",
                "4":" There, since it\n seemed to him a safe refuge, he hid himself with the\n most loyal of his friends, a certain Strategius, a soldier of the court guards\n who rose to be a senator, often going as secretly as possible to\n Constantinople, as was afterwards known from the testimony of that same\n Strategius when frequent investigations were held of the accomplices in the\n cabal. ",
                "5":" And so, after the fashion of some\n clever spy, being unrecognizable because of his unkempt appearance and his\n leanness, he gathered the gossip, which was then becoming frequent, of many\n who, since men are always discontented with present conditions, were finding\n fault with Valens, as being inflamed with a desire of seizing the property of\n others. ",
                "6":" To the emperor's cruelty deadly\n incentive was given by his father-in- law Petronius, who from the command of the Martensian legion\n had by\n a sudden jump been promoted to the rank of patrician. He was a man ugly in spirit and in appearance, who,\n burning with an immoderate longing to strip everyone without distinction,\n condemned guilty and innocent alike, after exquisite tortures, to fourfold\n indemnities, looking up debts going back to the time of the emperor Aurelian,\n and grieving excessively if he was\n obliged to let any one escape unscathed. ",
                "7":"\n Along with his intolerable character he had this additional incentive to his\n devastations, that while he was enriching himself through the woes of others,\n he was inexorable, cruel, savage and fearlessly\n hardhearted, never capable of giving or receiving reason, more hated than\n Cleander, who, as we read, when prefect under the\n emperor Commodus, in his haughty madness had ruined the fortunes of many men;\n more oppressive than Plautianus, also a\n prefect under Severus, who with superhuman arrogance would have caused general\n confusion, if he had not perished by the avenging sword. ",
                "8":" These lamentable occurrences, which under Valens,\n aided and abetted by Petronius, closed the houses of the poor and the palaces\n of the rich in great numbers, added to the fear of a still more dreadful\n future, sank deeply into the minds of the provincials and of the soldiers, who\n groaned under similar oppression, and with universal sighs everyone prayed\n (although darkly and in silence) for a change in the present condition of\n affairs with the help of the supreme deity.\n \n ",
                "9":" All this Procopius observed from his hiding-\n place, and thinking that when a more favourable turn of fortune should occur,\n the crown of supreme power could be gained with little trouble, he lay in wait\n like a beast of prey, ready to leap forth at once on seeing anything which he\n could seize. ",
                "10":" And while he was burning with\n impatience to hasten his designs, fate offered him this most timely\n opportunity. For Valens at the end of winter hastened to Syria and had already\n crossed the frontier of Bithynia, when he learned from the reports of his\n generals that the Gothic tribes, at that time unassailed\n and therefore very savage, were conspiring together and making\n preparations to invade the Thracian provinces. On learning this, in order that\n he himself might reach his destination without hindrance, Valens ordered a\n sufficient reinforcement of cavalry and infantry to be sent to the places where\n inroads of the savages were feared. ",
                "11":" And so,\n since the emperor was removed to a distance, Procopius, worn out by\n long-continued troubles, and thinking that even a cruel death would be more\n merciful than the evils by which he was tormented, hazarded at one cast all\n perils whatsoever; and without fear now of suffering the worst, led by a\n desperate resolve he essayed the bold deed of hastening to tempt the legions of\n Divitenses and the Younger Tungricani, who had\n been ordered with other troops to hasten to the urgent service in Thrace, and\n as usual were to remain for two days in Constantinople. This he did by hastening to appeal to\n certain acquaintances that he had among those same troops; but because it would\n be dangerous and difficult to speak with all, he confided in only a few.\n ",
                "12":" These men, enticed by the hope of great\n rewards, promised under the sanctity of an oath that they would do everything\n that he wished, guaranteeing also the favour of their comrades, with whom they\n held an important place in giving advice, since they were the highest paid\n and\n the most deserving. ",
                "13":" So, as had been agreed,\n as soon as the sun's rays illumined the day, the aforesaid\n Procopius, full of conflicting emotions, went to the Anastasian Baths, named\n for the sister of Constantine, where he knew that the\n legions had their quarters. There he learned from the confidants of his secrets\n that their whole number in a meeting by night had united in his support. Then,\n after a pledge of safety was willingly given him, he was received by the throng\n of venal soldiers and treated indeed with honour, although he seemed in a way\n to be held as a prisoner; for just as once before, after the death of Pertinax,\n the praetorians took up Julianus, when he was a bidder for the imperial power, so now also these\n troops, with an eye to every possible gain, defended Procopius, as he plotted\n to enter upon his ill-starred rule.\n \n ",
                "14":" So there he stood rather wasted (you would\n think that he had come up from the lower world), and because a purple robe\n could nowhere be found, he was dressed in a gold-embroidered tunic, like an\n attendant at court, but from foot to waist he looked like a page in the service\n of the palace ;\n he wore purple shoes on his feet, and bore a lance, and a small piece of purple\n cloth in his left hand; just as sometimes on the stage you might think that a\n splendidly decorated figure was suddenly made to appear as the curtain was\n raised, or through some mimic deception. \n ",
                "15":" Raised in a laughable \n manner to this dishonour of all honours, he ad- dressed\n his supporters with servile flattery, and promised them ample riches and\n dignities as the first-fruits of his principate. Then he appeared in public,\n surrounded by a number of armed men, and now advancing with more confidence and\n with upraised standards, attended with a fearful din of shields mournfully\n clashing together, which the soldiers from fear of his being pelted from\n housetops with stones or pieces of tile held closely joined together over the\n very crests of their helmets.\n \n ",
                "16":" And as he advanced more boldly, the people neither opposed nor favoured him; nevertheless, they were\n aroused by the sudden charm of novelty which is inborn in most of the commons,\n and they were still more strongly moved because they one and all (as we have\n already said) hated Petronius, who was enriching himself by violence, and was\n reviving transactions that were long since buried, and debts of the misty past\n brought up again against all classes. \n ",
                "17":" Accordingly, when the said Procopius had\n mounted the tribunal, and all were filled with amazement, fearing the gloomy\n silence, and believing (as indeed he had expected) that he had merely come to a\n steeper road to death, since a trembling which pervaded all his limbs hindered\n his speaking, he stood for a long time without a word.\n Finally, he beganwith broken and dying utterance to say a little, justifying\n his action by his relationship with the imperial family; then at first by the\n low whispers of a few, who had been hired for the purpose, later by the\n tumultuous acclamations of the people, he was hailed as emperor in disorderly\n fashion, and hastily went on to the Senate House. There finding none of the\n distinguished senators, but only a few persons of low rank, with rapid steps he\n hastened to the palace and entered it with ill-omened step.\n \n ",
                "18":" Certainly some may wonder that so laughable\n a reign, rashly and blindly begun, broke out into such lamentable disasters to\n the state, if perchance they are unacquainted with previous instances, and\n think that this happened for the first time. ",
                "19":"\n It was thus that Andriscus of Adramytium, a man\n born to the lowest condition, raised himself to the title of a Pseudophilippus\n and added to the Macedonian wars a third, full of danger. It was thus, when the\n emperor Macrinus was living at Antioch, that Heliogabalus Antoninus burst forth from Emesa. Thus, by the unexpected uprising of Maximinus, Alexander\n was murdered\n with his mother Mamaea. Thus in Africa the elder Gordian was hurried to the\n throne, but when he found himself entangled in the terror of coming dangers,\n ended his life with the noose. \n \n "

But some, thinking that\n anything was safer than the present condition, secretly left the city and went\n at rapid pace to the emperor's camp.\n \n ",
                "1":" All these were outstripped by the swift\n course of Sophronias, at that time a secretary and later city-prefect in\n Constantinople. He met Valens just as he was on the point of leaving Caesarea\n in Cappadocia, in order to go to his residence at Antioch, since the oppressive\n heat in Cilicia was already somewhat diminished, and after telling him what had\n happened, induced him, discouraged by this event and amazed, as was natural at\n such a crisis, to go to Galatia, in order to take hold of affairs while they\n were still unsettled.\n \n ",
                "2":" While Valens was hastening on by forced\n marches, Procopius with strictest attention was busy day and night, and brought\n forward certain emissaries, who with crafty assurance pretended that they had\n come, some from the Orient, others from Gaul, and falsely\n announced that Valentinian was dead and that everything was open to the new and\n beloved emperor. ",
                "3":" And because attempts at\n revolution, even though audaciously begun, are sometimes wont to be\n strengthened by quick action, accordingly, that nothing might be neglected\n which could arouse fear, Nebridius, recently promoted to be praetorian prefect\n in place of Salutius by the party of Petronius, and Caesarius, prefect of the\n city of Constantinople, were thrown into chains. Phronimius was ordered to take charge of the city with the usual powers, and\n Euphrasius was made chief-marshal of the court; both were Gauls, distinguished\n for their training in the noble arts. The direction of military affairs was\n entrusted to Gomoarius and Agilo, who were recalled to service —being an unwise\n appointment, as the result of their treachery revealed. \n ",
                "4":" Therefore because it was feared that Count\n Julius, who commanded the military forces in\n Thrace, if he should hear of the attempt, would march from the neighbouring\n posts to crush the rebels, an effective plan was devised. For a letter was\n extorted by violence from Nebridius, who was still in prison, in which it was\n pretended that by Valens' order Julius was to discuss serious measures relating\n to the disturbances among the barbarians; and so he was summonedto\n Constantinople and there held in strict confinement. Through this clever trick\n the warlike nations of Thrace were now won over without bloodshed, and this\n powerful support was gained by the rebellious venture. ",
                "5":" After this had been effected with such happy success,\n Araxius by soliciting the favour of the court became\n praetorian prefect, under pretext that he was supported by his son-in-law\n Agilo; and many others were employed in various services at court or in\n administrative posts in the provinces, some against their will, others because\n they offered themselves and paid for the positions. ",
                "6":" And as commonly happens in times of civil strife, some rose from the\n dregs of the people, led by desperation or by blind ambitions, while on the\n other hand some men of distinguished origin fell from their high estate even to\n death and exile.\n \n ",
                "7":" When through these and like conditions the\n party seemed firmly established, it remained to muster a sufficient force of\n soldiers, and a thing which in public disturbances has often times hampered\n bold enterprises even when their origin was justified, was managed with ease.\n ",
                "8":" For some divisions of cavalry and infantry\n which had been raised for the campaign in Thrace passed that way; they were\n received courteously and generously, and when they were all united in one body,\n there was already the appearance of an army. Eager for the riches\n that were promised, they swore allegiance to Procopius with dire penalties for\n disloyalty, promising to stand by him and protect him with their lives.\n ",
                "9":" There was found, besides, a very\n favourable means of winning them over, namely, that Procopius took in his arms\n the little daughter of Constantius, whose memory they honoured, and carried her\n about, claiming kinship with the former emperor. And he\n gained another timely advantage in that Faustina, the girl's mother, happened\n to be present when he had received some insignia forming a part of the imperial\n adornment. ",
                "10":" Also he added another stroke\n which was to be hastened with swift energy; for certain men chosen for their\n foolhardy daring were sent to take possession of Illyricum; these set out\n relying on no other aid than their impudence, using for their purpose\n goldpieces bearing the image of the new emperor and trying other devices for\n enticement; but Aequitius, the military commander in those regions, seized them\n and put them to death in various ways. ",
                "11":" Then,\n through fear of similar attempts, Aequitius blockaded the three narrow passes\n leading to the northern provinces, one through Dacia Ripensis, a second, the best known, through Succi,\n the third through Macedonia, and called\n Acontisma. And in consequence of these prudent\n measures, the usurper of illegitimate power was disappointed in his vain hope\n of seizing Illyricum and lost a great source of material for the war.\n \n ",
                "12":" While these things were thus going on,\n Valens, shocked by the terrible news and already returning through Galatia, on\n hearing what had happened at Constantinople advanced with distrust and fear.\n His sudden terror made him unfit for all ways of precaution, and his spirit had\n sunk so low that he even thought of casting aside his imperial robes as a heavy\n burden; and he would actually have done so, had he not been kept by the\n remonstrances of his intimates from the shameful intention and given courage by\n the advice of better men; accordingly, he ordered two\n legions, named the Jovii and the Victores, to go on ahead and attack the rebels\n in their camp.

                "13":" When these were already\n approaching, Procopius himself, having returned from Nicaea, to which place he\n had gone shortly before, with the Divitenses and a promiscuous rabble of\n deserters which he had got together in a brief space of time, hastened to\n Mygdus, a place laved by the river Sangarius.

                "14":" There the legions were already advancing upon each other, ready for battle,\n when Procopius rushed alone between them, while they were exchanging volleys,\n as if he wished to challenge the enemy. And by a stroke of good fortune as if\n he recognised in the enemy's lines a certain Vitalianus—whether he actually\n knew him is a matter of doubt—he saluted him courteously in Latin, and called\n him forward in a friendly fashion. Then he held out his hand to him and kissed\n him, to the amazement of all on both sides, and cried out: ",

That a base Pannonian should shake and\n trample upon the world, to gain a throne which he never so much as dared to\n pray for, we groan over your wounds and ours! No, no—follow rather the house\n of your own royal line, one who has taken up arms with the greatest justice,\n not in order to seize what is another's, but to restore himself to the\n possession of his ancestral majesty. \n \n \n ",
                "16":" Through these calm words, all the men who\n had come to fight hotly against him were pacified, and willingly went over to\n his side with the eagles and the tips of their standards\n lowered; and in place of terrible shouts that the barbarians call barritus\n he was hailed as emperor; all crowded about him in the customary\n manner, and in harmony escorted him back to the camp, swearing, in the\n soldiers' manner, by Jupiter that Procopius would be invincible.\n "

For a tribune called Rumitalca, who had been won\n over to the party of Procopius and given the charge of the palace, upon a\n carefully devised plan crossed the sea with his soldiers and came to the place\n formerly called Drepanum, now Helenopolis, and then with unexpected speed seized Nicaea.\n ",
                "1":" To besiege this city Valens sent, besides\n others skilled in that kind of fighting, Vadomarius, a former general and king\n of the Alamanni, and went on himself to Nicomedia. Leaving that place, he\n carried on the siege of Chalcedon with great vigour, from the walls of which\n city insults were hurled at him and he was derisively addressed as Sabaiarius.\n Now sabaia is a drink of the poorer people in Illyricum, a\n liquor made from barley or some other grain. \n ",

And by this mischance Bithynia also fell into the\n power of Procopius.\n \n ",
                "3":" When Valens had returned thence by rapid\n marches to Ancyra and learned that Lupicinus with a\n force not to be despised was drawing near from the Orient, his hopes for better\n success were aroused, and he sent his best general Arintheus to attack the enemy. ",
                "4":" When\n Arintheus reached Dadastana, the station where, as we have said, Jovian died, he suddenly saw Hyperechius and his forces\n opposed to him; he had before been merely in charge of the\n commander's supplies (that is, a servant of his belly and gullet), but\n Procopius had entrusted him as a friend with the command of a band of\n auxiliaries. And scorning to overcome in battle so despicable a man, relying on\n his authority and his imposing stature, Arintheus ordered the enemy themselves\n to put their leader in irons; and thus this shadow of a commander was taken\n prisoner by the hands of his own men.\n \n ",
                "5":" While affairs were proceeding in this way, a\n certain Venustus, an attendant on the state-treasury under Valens, who had been\n sent long before to Nicomedia, in order to distribute into the soldiers' hands\n the money that had been raised for the pay of those stationed in various parts\n of the Orient, hearing of this unfortunate occurrence, and seeing that the time\n was unfavourable for his task, quickly made his way to Cyzicus with the money\n he had received. ",
                "6":" There he chanced to meet\n Serenianus, at that time commander of the household troops, who had been sent\n to protect the treasures there; and since the city had an impregnable circuit\n of walls, and was known because of its old monuments, he tried to hold it,\n relying on the hastily formed garrison. Procopius had appointed a strong force\n to storm that city, in order to join Hellespontus to his side now he held\n Bithynia. ",
                "7":" However, the success of the work\n was delayed because often whole masses of the besiegers were slain by arrows,\n slingshots, and other missiles, and through the skill of the garrison the\n entrance to the port had been barred by a very strong iron chain, which was\n fastened to the land on both sides, so that even the\n armoured ships of the enemy could not force their way in. ",
                "8":" This chain, after various efforts of the soldiers and\n their leaders, who were exhausted by the hot fighting, was broken through by a\n tribune called Aliso, a distinguished and skilful warrior, in the following\n manner. He fastened together three boats and built upon them a protective\n covering after this fashion: in front stood armed men on the thwarts with their\n shields held close together over their heads, those behind them stooped down\n somewhat lower, and those in the third rank gradually lower still, so that,\n since the hindermost rested on their hams, the whole gave the appearance of an\n arched building. This kind of device, used in battles against walls, has this\n form in order that the volleys of missiles and rocks, gliding down the sloping\n side, may flow off like showers of rain. ",
                "9":"\n Thus Aliso, defended for the time being from the volleys of missiles, being a\n man of great bodily strength, placed a block underneath and struck the chain\n heavy blows with an axe, breaking it in such a way that it fell apart and\n opened a broad entrance; and by this result the city was exposed unprotected to\n the enemy's attack. Because of this, when the ring-leader of the whole\n rebellion was later killed, and the members of his party were cruelly treated,\n this same tribune, being allowed to keep his life and his position in the army\n in view of his brilliant exploit, was slain long afterwards in Isauria at the\n hands of a predatory band.\n \n ",
                "10":" When Cyzicus had been opened to him by this\n martial stroke, Procopius quickly hastened to the city; he pardoned all who had\n opposed him, except Serenianus alone, who was by his order\n put in irons and taken to Nicaea to be closely guarded. ",
                "11":" And immediately afterwards Ormisdas, a mature young\n man, son of the royal prince of the same name, was given the rank of\n proconsul, and therewith according to ancient usage the control of civil and\n military affairs. This man acted with great mildness, in accordance with his\n disposition, and when he was on the point of being seized by a sudden onset of\n the soldiers whom Valens had sent through by-paths of Phrygia, he made his\n escape with such vigorous courage, that he embarked on board a ship which he\n had got ready in case of danger, and carried off his wife safely amid volleys\n of arrows when she followed him and was all but taken prisoner; she was a rich\n and distinguished matron, whose high reputation and commendable firmness later\n saved her husband amid extreme dangers.\n \n ",
                "12":" By this victory Procopius was elated, beyond\n what is lawful for mortals, and forgetting that any happy man, if Fortune's\n wheel turns, may before evening become most wretched, he ordered the house of\n Arbitio, full of priceless furniture, to be completely stripped. Hitherto he\n had spared it as if it were his own, believing that the man was on his side;\n but he had been incensed because he had summoned Arbitio several times to come\n to him and Arbitio had put him off, pleading the infirmities of age and\n illness.

                "13":" And although for this reason the\n usurper feared serious consequences, nevertheless, since he could now boldly\n invade the oriental provinces without opposition, in fact even with the free\n consent of all—as those provinces were eager to see any change, from their dislike of the strict rule under which they were\n then held—for the purpose of winning over some cities of Asia and surrounding\n himself with men skilled in raising money (as likely to be helpful to him in\n the numerous great battles which he expected) he slothfully delayed and became\n blunt, just as a sharp sword might.

Emboldened by this, he proceeded to stir up many disturbances, and being convicted\n of cheating in a matter of business with some ship-captains, as was\n reported, he met death at the hands of the executioner when\n Claudius was city-prefect. \n \n \n ",

For\n through all quarters of the city which had been adorned at the expenses of\n various emperors, he had his own name inscribed, not as the restorer of old\n buildings, but as their founder. From this fault the emperor Trajan also is\n said to have suffered, and for that reason he was jestingly called\n wall-wort. \n \n \n \n ",

In\n consequence, he was barely able by swift flight to avoid the anger of the\n incensed poor, who had repeated losses to lament.\n \n ",
                "10":" As his successor came Viventius, a former court-chancellor, a just and prudent man of Pannonia, whose\n administration was quiet and mild, and rich in an abundance of everything.

Therefore,\n my valiant men, accept I pray you with friendly minds my heart's desire,\n convinced that we have wished this action, which the duties of affection\n sanction, not only to be brought to your knowledge, but also to be confirmed\n by your approval as agreeable to you and likely to be advantageous.\n This son of mine, Gratianus, now become\n a man, has long lived among your children, and you love him as a tie between\n you and me; therefore, in order to secure the public peace on all sides, I\n plan to take him as my associate in the imperial power, if the propitious\n will of the god of heaven and of your dignity shall support what a father's\n love suggests. He has not been, as we have been, brought up in a severe\n school from his very cradle, nor trained in the endurance of adversity, and\n (as you see) he is not yet able to endure the dust of Mars; but, in harmony\n with the glory of his family and the great deeds of his forefathers, he will\n forthwith rise (I speak with moderation, in fear of Nemesis) to greater\n heights. For as I am wont to think, when I\n consider, as I often do, his character and his inclinations, although they\n are not yet fully developed: when he enters on the years of youth, since he\n has been instructed in the liberal arts and in the pursuit of skilful\n accomplishments, he will weigh with impartial justice the\n value of right and wrong actions; he will so conduct himself that good men\n will know that he understands them; he will rush forward to noble deeds and\n cling close to the military standards and eagles; he will endure sun and\n snow, frost and thirst, and wakeful hours; he will defend his camp, if\n necessity ever requires it; he will risk his life for the companions of his\n dangers; and, what is the first and highest duty of loyalty, he will know\n how to love his country as he loves the home of his father and\n grandfather. \n \n \n ",

He was\n a man who left many proofs of noble self-confidence worthy of imitation by\n sensible men, one who never deviated from the principles of a fearless nature,\n but was always firm andresembled the laws, which, as we know, in the manifold\n cases in court speak with one and the same voice; and he then remained truer to the side of justice which he had\n espoused, even when the emperor, becoming arbitrary, assailed him with threats\n when he gave him good advice.

However, in this affair Valentinian overstepped the usage established of\n old, in that he named his brother and his son, not Caesar, but Augustus,\n generously enough.

The plan thus agreed upon was\n hastily carried out, and Gratianus, whose youth was even then unequal to\n battles and toil, was kept back with the legion of the Joviani, while\n Valentinian, as a deliberate and cautious leader, with uncovered head surveyed\n the centuries and maniples; and without taking anyone of the higher officers\n into his confidence he dismissed his throng of attendants, and with a few\n companions, known to him for their energy and fidelity, hastened off to inspect\n the foot of the hills, declaring (for he had a lofty opinion of his own\n judgment) that another wav besides that which the scouts had seen could be\n found leading to the steep heights.

                "0":" While among the Persians (as I have already\n related) the perfidy of the king was arousing\n unexpected disturbances, and in the eastern regions wars were\n rising with renewed strength, somewhat more than sixteen years after the death\n of Nepotianus, Bellona, raging throughout the Eternal City, set all\n ablaze, being aroused from insignificant beginnings to lamentable massacres;\n and I could wish that everlasting silence had consigned these to oblivion, lest\n haply at some time similar crimes should be attempted, which might do more harm\n from their general example and precedent than through the offences themselves.\n ",
                "1":" And although, after long consideration of\n various circumstances, well-grounded dread restrained me from giving a minute\n account of this series of bloody deeds, yet I shall, relying on the better\n morals of the present day, set forth briefly such of them as are worthy of\n notice and I shall not be sorry to tell concisely what I have feared from\n events of antiquity. ",
                "2":" When in the first Medic\n war the Persians had plundered Asia, they besieged Miletus with mighty forces,\n threatened the defenders with death by torture, and drove the besieged to the\n necessity, overwhelmed as they all were by a weight of evils, of killing their\n own dear ones, consigning their movable possessions to the flames, and each one\n striving to be first to throw himself into the fire, to burn on the common\n funeral pyre of their country. ",
                "3":" Soon after\n this, Phrynichus composed a play with this disaster as its plot, which he put\n upon the stage at Athens in the lofty language of tragedy. At first he was\n heard with pleasure, but as the sad story went on in too tragic style, the\n people became angry and punished him, thinking that \n consolation was not his object but blame and reproach, when he had the bad\n taste to include among stage-plays a portrayal even of those sufferings which a\n well-beloved city had undergone, without receiving any support from its\n founders. For Miletus was a colony of\n the Athenians founded by Nileus, the son of Codrus (who is said to have\n sacrificed himself for his country in the Dorian war) and by other Ionians.\n \n ",
                "4":" But let us come to our subject.\n Maximinus, who formerly held the office of vice- prefect at Rome, was born at Sopianae, a town of Valeria,\n of very humble\n parents, his father being an accountant in the governor's office and\n sprung from ancestors who were Carpi, a people whom Diocletian drove from its\n ancient abode and transferred to\n Pannonia. ",
                "5":" Maximinus, after some slight study\n of the liberal arts, and after acting as a pleader without acquiring\n distinction, became governor of Corsica, also of Sardinia, and finally of\n Tuscia. then, because his successor lingered too\n long on the way, although transferred to the charge of the city's grain supply, he\n retained also the rule of Tuscia, and at the beginning acted with moderation,\n for a three-fold reason. ",
                "6":" First, because the\n prophecies of his father were still warm in his ears, a man exceedingly skilful in interpreting omens from\n the flight or the notes of birds, who declared he would attain to high power,\n but would die by the sword of the executioner; secondly, because he had got\n hold of a man from Sardinia who was highly skilled in calling\n up baneful spirits and eliciting predictions from the ghosts of the dead. This\n man he himself afterwards put to death, so the rumour went, in a treacherous\n fashion,—so long as he survived, Maximinus was more yielding and mild, for fear\n that he might be betrayed—finally, because while creeping through low places\n like a serpent under ground he could not yet stir up causes for death on a larger\n scale.\n \n ",
                "7":" The first opportunity to widen the sphere of\n his operations arose from the following affair. Chilo, a former\n deputy-governor, and his wife Maxima made complaint before Olybrius, at that\n time prefect of the city, declaring that their life\n had been attempted by poison; and they managed that those whom they suspected\n should at once be seized and put in prison. The accused were an organ-builder\n Sericus, a wrestler Asbolius,\n and a soothsayer Campensis. ",
                "8":" But as the affair\n languished because of a severe illness with which Olybrius was long affected,\n those who had brought the charge, impatient of delay, presented a petition,\n asking that the examination of the dispute should be turned over to the prefect\n of the grain supply; and from a desire for a speedy decision this was granted.\n ",
                "9":" Thus Maximinus gained the power of doing\n harm and poured out the natural cruelty implanted in his hard heart, as often\n happens with wild beasts in the amphitheatre, when they break in pieces the\n back-gates and are at last set free.\n And while the business was being looked into in many ways, as if in a kind of\n preliminary practice, and some persons, whose sides had been torn into furrows,\n had named certain nobles as having, through their clients and\n other common people who were notorious as malefactors and informers, made use\n of men skilled in harmful practices, the hellish judge, going beyond his\n last \n (as the saying is), in a malicious report to the emperor informed him\n that the offences which many men had committed at Rome could not be\n investigated or punished except by severer measures. 11. On hearing\n this, the emperor, in anger, being rather a cruel than a strict foe of vices,\n gave one general judicial sentence to cover cases of the kind, which he\n arbitrarily fused with the design of treason, and ruled that all those whom the\n justice of the ancient code and the edicts of deified emperors had made exempt\n from inquisitions by torture should, if circumstances demanded, be examined\n with torments. 12. And that with doubled power and higher rank Maximinus might\n patch together a greater heap of calamities, the emperor gave him a temporary\n appointment as acting prefect at Rome; \n and he associated with him in the investigation of these charges which\n were being devised for the peril of many the secretary Leo, afterward\n chief-marshal of the court, a Pannonian and a\n grave-robber, snorting forth cruelty\n from the grinning jaws of a wild beast, and no less insatiable in his thirst\n for human blood than Maximinus. 13. The persistent natural bent of Maximinus to\n cruel conduct was increased by the coming of a colleague of the same character\n and by the charm of a commission conferring lofty rank. Therefore, full of joy,\n he turned his steps this way and that, seeming to dance rather than walk, and\n seeking to imitate the Brahmins, who march (as some say)\n above the earth among their altars. \n \n \n ",
                "10":" And now, as the trumpets sounded the signal\n for the murder of citizens and all were stupified by the horrible situation,\n besides many harsh and merciless acts, which because of their variety and\n number cannot be enumerated, the execution of Marinus, a public advocate, was\n conspicuous. This man was accused of having dared by forbidden arts to try to\n gain a certain Hispanilla as his wife, and when the truthfulness of the\n evidence had been perfunctorily examined, Maximinus condemned him to death.\n ",
                "11":" And since I think that perchance some of\n my readers by careful examination may note and bring it against me as a\n reproach that this, and not that, happened first, or that those things which\n they themselves saw are passed over, I must satisfy them to this extent: that\n not everything which has taken place among persons of the lowest class is worth\n narrating; and if this were necessary to be done, even the arrays of facts to\n be gained from the public records themselves would not suffice, when there was\n such a general fever of evils, and a new and unbridled madness was mingling the\n highest with the lowest; for it was clearly evident that it was not a judicial\n trial which was to be feared, but a suspension of legal proceedings. \n \n \n ",
                "12":" Then Cethegus, a senator, was accused of\n adultery and beheaded, Alypius, a young man of noble birth, was banished for a\n trifling fault, and others of lower rank were publicly put to death; and every\n one, seeing in their unhappy fate the picture (as it were) of\n his own danger, dreamt of the torturer and of fetters and lodgings of\n darkness.\n \n ",
                "13":" At the same time, the case of Hymetius also,\n a man of distinguished character, was tried, of which we know this to have been\n the course of events. When he was governing Africa as proconsul he took from\n the storehouses grain intended for the Roman people and sold it to the\n Carthaginians, who were by that time worn out from lack of food, and a little\n later, when the crops were again abundant, without any delay completely\n restored what he had taken. ",
                "14":" Moreover, since\n ten bushels had been sold to the needy for one gold-piece, while he himself now\n bought thirty, he sent\n the profit from the difference in price to the emperor's treasury. And so Valentinian, suspecting that he had sent less\n than he should have sent as the result of his trafficking, punished him with a\n fine of a part of his property. ",
                "15":" To add to\n his calamity, this also had happened at that same time, which was not less\n fatal. The soothsayer Amantius, at that time especially notorious, was betrayed\n on secret evidence of having been employed by the said Hymetius, for the\n purpose of committing certain criminal acts, to perform a sacrifice; but when\n brought to trial, although he stood bent double upon the rack, he denied it with obstinate insistence.\n ",
                "16":" Upon his denial, his secret papers were\n brought from his house and a memorandum in the handwriting of Hymetius was\n found, begging him that by carrying out a solemn sacrifice he should prevail\n upon the deity to make the emperors milder towards him; and at the end of the document were read\n some reproaches of Valentinian as avaricious and cruel. ",
                "17":" When the emperor learned this from the report of the\n judges, who gave what had been done a harsh interpretation, he issued orders\n that the affair should be investigated with excessive strictness. And since\n Frontinus, an adviser of the said Hymetius, was charged with having drawn up the form of\n prayer that was made, he was mangled with rods, and having confessed his guilt,\n was exiled to Britain; but Amantius was later found guilty of a capital crime\n and executed. ",
                "18":" After this course of events\n Hymetius was taken to the town of Ocriculum, to\n be heard by Ampelius, prefect of the city, and\n Maximinus, the deputy-prefect; and when it was evident that he would\n immediately be condemned to death, he boldly appealed to the emperor's\n protection, when the opportunity was given him, and, defended under the refuge\n of that name, saved his life. ",
                "19":" When the\n emperor was consulted about this matter, he referred the business to the senate. And when\n they had weighed the case in the scales of justice and learned the truth and\n had exiled the accused to Boae, \n a place in Dalmatia, they could hardly bear the wrath of the emperor, who was\n greatly incensed on learning that a man whom he had intended to be condemned to\n death had been punished with a milder sentence.\n \n \n ",
                "20":" On account of this occurrence and many\n others of the same kind, the fate which was seen to overtake a few persons\n began to be feared by all. And lest, by so many evils that were ignored, and\n gradually creeping on, the mass of troubles should be increased, by resolution\n of the nobles envoys were sent to the emperor. These were Praetextatus,\n former prefect of the city, Venustus, a\n one-time deputy-prefect, and Minervius, who had\n been a consular governor. They were to ask that punishments should be inflicted\n that were not too severe for the offences, and that no\n senator should, in a fashion neither practised nor permitted, be subjected to\n torture. ",
                "21":" When the deputation had been\n admitted to the council-chamber and had presented their request, Valentinian\n said that he had never made such a decree, and cried out that he was the victim\n of calumny. But the quaestor Eupraxius mildly\n contradicted him, and through his freedom of speech the cruel order, which\n surpassed all examples of harshness, was rescinded.\n \n ",
                "22":" At about that same time Lollianus, a youth\n just growing his first beard, son of the ex-prefect Lampadius, as the result of a strict examination by Maximinus, was\n convicted of having written a book on destructive magic arts, when adult age\n had not yet endowed him with sound judgment. And when it was feared that he\n would be exiled, by his father's advice he appealed to the emperor and was\n ordered to be taken to his court; but he went from the smoke (as the saying is)\n into the fire; for he was handed over to Phalangius, consular\n governor of Baetica, and died at the hand of the dread\n executioner.\n \n ",
                "23":" Besides these also Tarracius Bassus,\n afterwards prefect of the city, his brother Camenius, a\n certain Marcianus, and Eusaphius, all men of senatorial rank, were brought to\n trial on the ground that they were said to be making much of the charioteer\n \n Auchenius, and were his accomplices in the use of poisons; but because the\n evidence was even then doubtful, they were acquitted, as widespread rumour\n declared, through the influence of Victorinus, who was the closest friend of\n Maximinus.\n \n ",
                "24":" Not even women were more immune from similar\n calamities. For many of high birth belonging to this sex too were charged with\n the disgrace of adultery or of fornication, and put to death. Conspicuous among\n these were Charitas and Flaviana, of whom the latter, when she was led to\n death, was stripped of the clothing which she wore, being allowed not even to\n keep sufficient covering for the secret parts of her body. But for that reason\n the executioner was convicted of having committed a monstrous crime, and was\n burned alive.\n \n ",
                "25":" Nay more, two senators, Paphius and\n Cornelius, both of whom confessed to having disgraced themselves by the wicked\n practices of poisons, by the sentence of the same Maximinus were put to death.\n Even the head of the mint perished by a like fate. But\n Sericus and Asbolius, mentioned above, because when he\n urged them to name indiscriminately such accomplices as they wished, he had\n declared on oath that he would order no one to be punished\n with fire or steel, he killed with heavy blows of lead. And after this he consigned the soothsayer Campensis to the\n flames, being bound in his case by no oath.\n \n ",
                "26":" It is, I think, fitting now to set forth the\n cause which drove Aginatius headlong to death, a man of noble descent from his\n early ancestors, as persistent report declared; for as to this there is no\n trustworthy documentary evidence. ",
                "27":" Maximinus,\n breathing blasts of arrogance, while he was still prefect of the grain supply,\n and finding no slight incentives to his audacity, went so far as to insult\n Probus, the most distinguished man among all\n the highest officials, and governing several provinces with the rank of\n praetorian prefect. ",
                "28":" Aginatius, filled with\n indignation at this, and resentful because Maximinus, in conducting\n examinations, was preferred to him by Olybrius, although he himself was\n vice-prefect of Rome, secretly informed Probus in a confidential communication\n that the worthless man, one who\n quarrelled with high merits, could easily be brought low, if Probus decided\n that it should be done. ",
                "29":" This letter Probus,\n as some maintained, without the knowledge of anyone except the bearer,\n sent to Maximinus, fearing him as a man already very highly\n trained in wickedness and in favour with the emperor. On reading the letter\n that savage man fell into such a blaze of anger, that from then on he set all\n devices in motion against Aginatius, after the manner of a serpent crushed by a\n wound from some unknown person. ",
                "30":" There was\n added to this another more powerful impulse to treacherous attacks, which\n ruined the said Aginatius. For he accused Victorinus after\n his death of having sold decisions of Maximinus during his lifetime, although he himself had\n received no contemptible legacies from Victorinus' will; and with like\n impudence he threatened Anepsia also, Victorinus's widow, with charges and\n litigious suits. ",
                "31":" The woman, fearful of these\n troubles, and wishing to protect herself by the help of Maximinus, pretended\n that her husband in a will which he had made shortly before his death had left\n him 3000 pounds of silver. Maximinus then, enflamed with excessive greed—for he\n was not free from that vice also—demanded half of her inheritance. But by no\n means content even with this, which he thought too little, he devised another\n plan, honourable and safe (as he thought), and in order not to lose the\n opportunity which was offered him for profiting from rich estate, he asked for\n the hand of the step-daughter of Victorinus (Anepsia's own child) for his son;\n and this was quickly secured with the woman's consent.\n \n ",
                "32":" Through these and other equally lamentable\n crimes, which were a blot on the fair aspect of the Eternal City, this man, to\n be named only with groans, made his violent way over the ruins of many\n fortunes, passing beyond the limits afforded by the courts. For he is said to\n have had a cord hanging from a secluded window of his palace, the lower end of\n which could pick up certain seemingly incriminating charges, supported, it is\n true, by no evidence, but nevertheless likely to injure many innocent persons.\n And sometimes he ordered Mucianus and\n Barbarus, his attendants, who were most skilled in deception, severally to be\n cast out of his house. \n ",
                "33":" These two then, as if bewailing the fate by\n which they pretended to be overwhelmed, exaggerated the cruelty of the judge\n and often repeated the assertion that the accused had no other means of saving\n their lives than by charging men of high rank with serious crimes; for they\n declared that by involving such men in the same accusations with themselves\n they could easily secure an acquittal.\n \n ",
                "34":" Because of this, with a ruthlessness now\n passing all bounds, the hands of very many were bound in fetters, and men of\n noble birth were seen in mourning garb and in distress. And none of them could\n rightly be blamed, since very often when waiting upon him with bodies bent so\n as almost to touch the ground, they constantly heard that brigand with the\n heart of a wild beast shout that no one could be found innocent without his\n consent. ",
                "35":" Such words, which accomplishment\n quickly followed, would surely have terrified men like Numa Pompilius, and a\n Cato. For, in fact, the business was conducted in such a way that some people\n could not even contemplate the ills of others with dry eyes, a thing which\n often happens in the many difficult trials of life. ",
                "36":" Nevertheless, the iron-hearted judge, often as he deviated from law\n and justice, was endurable in what may be called one special thing. For at\n times he could be prevailed upon to show mercy to some; although this, we read\n in the following passage in Cicero, is almost a\n vice: For, he says, when anger is implacable, there is\n extreme severity; but if it yields to entreaties, the greatest inconstancy:\n yet the latter, as a choice of evils, is to be preferred to\n severity. \n \n \n \n ",
                "37":" After this, Maximinus received a successor,\n and was summoned to the emperor's\n court, as Leo had been before him; and there,\n being promoted to the praetorian prefecture, he was no whit milder, but like\n the basilisk, was harmful even from a distance. ",
                "38":" At\n that time, or not much earlier, the brooms with which the assembly-hall of the\n nobles was swept were seen to bloom, and this was an omen that some men of the\n most despised station would be raised to high rank in the offices of state.\n \n ",
                "39":" Although it is high time to return to the\n course of the history which we have begun, yet, in order not to interfere with\n the connection of events, I shall linger over a few of the wrongful acts\n committed by the iniquity of the vice-prefects in the city, since it was\n according to the nod and wish of Maximinus that they were done by those same\n subordinates—I might say attendants . ",
                "40":" After him came Ursicinus, inclined to milder measures; he, wishing\n to be prudent and kindly, had referred to the Court the information that Esaias\n (with others who had been imprisoned because of adulterous relations with\n Rufina) was trying to bring a charge of treason against her husband, Marcellus,\n a former agent of the state. In consequence, Ursicinus was despised as inactive\n and unfit for the vigorous prosecution of such matters, and was forced to\n withdraw from his deputyship. ",
                "41":" To him\n succeeded Simplicius of Hemona, a former teacher of literature and later an adviser of Maximinus, a man who during the administration of the\n prefecture was neither proud nor arrogant, but excited fear by his sidelong\n glance, and in language of studied moderation plotted severity for many. And\n first he put to death Rufina, with all who were implicated in, or aware of, the\n adultery that she had committed, whose case (as we have previously said)\n Ursicinus had referred to the Court; and then many\n others, regardless of whether they were guilty or innocent. ",
                "42":" For vying in bloody rivalry with Maximinus, as his\n leader, he strove to outdo him in cutting the sinews of\n distinguished families, imitating Busiris of old, and Antaeus and Phalaris\n to such a degree that he seemed to lack only the\n Agrigentine bull of the last-named.\n \n ",
                "43":" Amid these and such acts so perpetrated a\n matron called Hesychia, who because of an attempted crime was committed to an\n official's attendant to be guarded at his house, and was in fear of much cruel\n treatment, pressed her face in the feather bed on which she was lying and so\n stopped her nose and her breath and gave up the ghost.\n \n ",
                "44":" There was added to these another no less\n cruel evil. For Eumenius and Abienus, both of senatorial rank, being accused\n under Maximinus of improper conduct with Fausiana, a woman of position, after\n the death of Victorinus, under whose protection they lived with less anxiety,\n terrified by Simplicius' coming who with threats planned no less cruelty than Maximinus, fled to secret retreats. ",
                "45":" But after Fausiana had been found guilty, a charge\n was made against them also; but though summoned by edicts, they kept themselves in still\n closer concealment, and Abienus remained hidden for a long time in the house of\n Anepsia. But as unexpected chances often aggravate lamentable disasters, a\n slave of Anepsia, Sapaudulus by name, seized with resentment because his wife\n had been flogged, went by night to\n Simplicius and reported the matter; then attendants were sent and dragged the\n accused, whose whereabouts had been pointed out, from their hiding-places.\n ",
                "46":" And Abienus, assailed with an additional\n accusation of improper relations which he was said to have had with Anepsia,\n was punished with death. But the woman, that she might have strong hope of\n retaining her life by putting off her punishment, declared that she had been\n worked upon by evil arts and had suffered violence in the house of Aginatius.\n ",
                "47":" Simplicius gave the emperor a spiteful\n account of what had been done, and Maximinus, who was at court, and, for the\n reason which I have given above, was hostile to\n Aginatius, while his hatred was set ablaze with his rise in power, strongly\n urged the emperor to give him a warrant for putting Aginatius to death; and\n this the mad and powerful instigator easily brought to pass. ",
                "48":" But Maximinus, fearing the weight of greater hatred,\n if a man of patrician stock should die by the sentence of Simplicius, who was\n his adviser and his friend, kept back the emperor's order for some time, in\n perplexity and doubt as to whom he would find most trustworthy and efficient in\n carrying out the cruel design. ",
                "49":" At last, since like and like readily flock together, a Gaul called Doryphorianus was found, reckless to the point of\n insanity, on whom, since he promised to accomplish the business in a short\n time, he arranged to have the post of deputy conferred. Accordingly, he gave\n him with the epistle of Augustus a letter of\n advice instructing the savage but inexperienced man how he might quickly and\n without any hindrance destroy Aginatius, who, if he gained any possible\n respite, would perhaps make his escape. ",
                "50":"\n Doryphorianus, as had been ordered, hastened to Rome by long days' journeys,\n and at the beginning of his administration cast about with great energy, to see by what act of violence he could\n without anyone's help destroy a senator of conspicuous lineage. And on learning\n that Aginatius had long since been found, and was under guard in his own villa,\n he arranged personally to examine him, and Anepsia as well, as the chief of the\n guilty persons, in the midst of the horrors of night, when men's minds are\n commonly dulled in the bonds of terrors: as among countless other instances is\n shown by Homer's Ajax, who wished rather to die\n by daylight than endure the additional suffering of dread by night. ",
                "51":" And since the judge, nay, rather the godless\n brigand, intent only on keeping his promise, carried everything to excess,\n having ordered Aginatius to be put to the question, he caused a whole train of executioners to enter, and amid the gloomy clanking of\n chains had the slaves, who were already drooping through long continued filth\n and neglect, tortured to the very verge of death, to give evidence to endanger\n their master's life: a thing which our merciful laws forbade to be done in a\n trial for fornication. ",
                "52":" Finally, when\n tortures already almost mortal had extorted from a maid-servant a few ambiguous\n words, without fully examining the trustworthiness of the testimony, he ordered\n Aginatius to be led off to execution, hastily and without a hearing, although\n with loud cries he called upon the emperors' names. Accordingly he was hoisted\n up and put to death; and Anepsia was executed on a\n like sentence. While Maximinus was thus busied in person when he was in Rome\n and through his emissaries when he acted from a distance, the Eternal City wept\n bitterly for its dead.\n \n ",
                "53":" But the final curses of his victims did not\n sleep. For, under Gratian, as shall be told later at the proper time,\n not only did this same Maximinus,\n because of his intolerable arrogance, fall victim to the executioner's sword,\n but Simplicius also was beheaded in Illyricum. Doryphorianus, too, was charged\n with a capital crime and thrown into the prison called Tullianum, \n but Gratian, at the suggestion of his mother, had him taken from there, and on\n his return home put him to death with tremendous tortures. But let us return to\n the point from which we made this digression. This, if I may say so, was the\n state of affairs in Rome. \n \n \n "

                "0":" But Valentinian, meditating important and useful plans, fortified the entire Rhine from the beginnings of Raetia\n as far as the strait of the Ocean with great earthworks, erecting lofty\n fortresses and castles, and towers at frequent intervals, in suitable and\n convenient places as far as the whole length of Gaul extends; in some places\n also works were constructed even on the farther bank of the river, which flows by the lands of the savages. ",
                "1":" Finally, when he considered that a lofty and secure\n fortification (which he himself had built from its very foundations) since a\n river called the Nicer flowed at its foot could\n gradually be undermined by the immense force of the waters, he even thought of\n turning the course of the stream in a different direction; and after he had\n hunted up men skilled in hydraulic work, the difficult task was begun with a\n great force of soldiers. ",
                "2":" For during many days\n beams of oak were bound together and placed in the bed of the river; but although they\n were fastened again and again by great piles driven close to them on both\n sides, they were forced from their place by the rising waters, and finally were\n swept away by the force of the current and lost.

                "5":" Accordingly, he often sent\n letters to their kings through silent and loyal messengers, urging them to\n attack the Alamanni at an appointed time, and promising that he too would cross\n the Rhine with the Roman armies and, if the Alamanni tried to avoid the\n unexpected weight of armed forces, would intercept them in their panic.\n \n ",
                "6":" The emperor's letters were gladly received\n for two reasons: first, because the Burgundians know that they are descendants\n of the Romans from ancient times; and then, since they frequently quarrelled with the\n Alamanni about salt-pits and boundaries. They therefore\n sent their choicest troops, which, before our soldiers were gathered together,\n advanced as far as the banks of the Rhine; and while the emperor was still\n occupied with the building of fortifications, they caused the very greatest\n alarm to our people. ",
                "7":" And so they halted for\n a time, but when Valentinian did not appear on the appointed day, as he had\n agreed, and they saw that none of his promises had been fulfilled, they sent\n envoys to the emperor's camp, demanding that support be given them for their\n return to their homes, in order that they might not expose their unprotected\n rear to the enemy.

On the other hand the chief priest among the Burgundians is\n called Sinistus, holds his power for life, and is exposed to no such dangers as\n threaten the kings.\n \n ",
                "10":" Taking advantage of this very timely\n occasion, Theodosius, at that time commander of the cavalry, made an attack through Raetia upon the Alamanni, who through\n fear of the aforesaid people were scattered; he\n killed many of them, and by the emperor's order sent all his prisoners to\n Italy, where they received fertile cantons, and now live as our subjects on the\n banks of the Po. \n \n "

These envoys, by inquiring of those mentioned above (Severus, whom\n they met at Carthage, and Flaccianus), what they had done, learned that they\n had been ordered to make their report to the deputy and the general.

                "19":"\n Therefore, since his conscience was witness to disgraceful acts, Palladius then\n came to an understanding with Romanus, and on his return to the palace, he\n misled Valentinian by the atrocious art of lying, declaring that the people of\n Tripolis had no cause for complaint. Accordingly, he was sent again to Africa\n with Jovinus, the last of all the envoys (for Pancratius had died at Treves),\n in order with the deputy to examine in person the value of\n the work of the second deputation also. Besides this, the emperor gave orders\n that the tongues of Erechthius and Aristomenes should be cut out, since the\n aforesaid Palladius had intimated that they had made some offensive\n statements.\n \n ",
                "20":" The secretary, following the deputy, as had\n been arranged, came to Tripolis. As soon as Romanus learned of this, with all\n speed he sent his attendant thither, and with him an adviser of his, Caecilius\n by name, a native of that province. Through these all the townspeople were\n inducedwhether by bribes or deceit is uncertain-to make grave charges against\n Jovinus, positively declaring that they had given him no commission to report\n what he had reported to the emperor. In fact, their dishonesty went so far that\n even Jovinus himself was forced to endanger his own life by confessing that he\n had lied to the emperor.\n \n ",
                "21":" When this was known through Palladius, who had now returned, Valentinian, being rather inclined to severity, gave\n orders that Jovinus, as the originator of the false statement, with\n Caelestinus, Concordius, and Lucius as accomplices and participants, should\n suffer capital punishment; further, that Ruricius, the governor, should suffer\n death as the author of a false report, the following also being counted against him—that there were read in\n his report certain expressions of his which seemed immoderate.

                "22":" Ruricius was executed at Sitifis, the rest were\n punished at Utica through sentence of the deputy-governor Crescens. Flaccianus,\n however, before the death of the other envoys, was heard by the deputy and the\n general; and when he stoutly defended his life, he was all\n but killed by the angry soldiers, who rushed upon him with shouts and abusive\n language; for they declared against him that the Tripolitani could not possibly\n be defended for the reason that they themselves had declined to furnish what\n was necessary for the campaign. ",
                "23":" And for this\n reason Flaccianus was imprisoned, until the emperor, who had been consulted\n about him, should make up his mind what ought to be done. But he bribed his\n guards—so it was permissible to believe—and made his escape to the city of\n Rome, where he kept in hiding until he passed away by a natural death.\n \n ",
                "24":" In consequence of this remarkable end of the\n affair, Tripolis, though harassed by disasters from without and from within,\n remained silent, but not without defence; for the eternal eye of Justice\n watched over her, as well as the last curses of\n the envoys and the governor. For long afterwards the following event came to pass: Palladius was dismissed from service, and\n stript of the haughtiness with which he swelled, and retired to a life of\n inaction. ",
                "25":" And when Theodosius, that famous\n leader of armies, had come into Africa to put an end to the dangerous attempts\n of Firmus, and, as he had been ordered, examined the\n moveable property of the outlawed Romanus, there was found also among his\n papers the letter of one Meterius, containing the words, Meterius to\n Romanus his Lord and patron, and at the end, after much matter that\n would here be irrelevant: The disgraced Palladius salutes you, and says\n that he was deposed for no other reason than that in the cause of the people\n of Tripolis he spoke to the sacred ears what was not true. \n ",
                "26":" When this letter had been\n sent to the Palace and read, Meterius, on being seized by order of Valentinian,\n admitted that the letter was his. Therefore Palladius was ordered to be\n produced, but thinking of the mass of crimes that he had concocted, at a\n halting-station, as darkness was coming on, noticing the absence of the guards,\n who on a festal day of the Christian religion were spending the whole\n night in church, he knotted a noose about his neck and strangled himself.\n ",
                "27":" When this favourable turn of fortune was\n fully known and the instigator of the awful troubles put to death, Erechthius\n and Aristomenes, who, when they learned that it had been ordered that their\n tongues should be cut out, as over-lavishly\n used, had withdrawn to far remote and hidden places, now hastened from\n concealment; and when the emperor Gratian—for Valentinian had died—was given\n trustworthy information of the abominable deception, they were sent for trial\n to the proconsul Hesperius and the deputy Flavianus.\n These officials, being men of impartial justice combined\n with most rightful authority, having put Caecilius to the torture, learned from\n his open confession that he himself had persuaded his citizens to make trouble\n for the envoys by false statements. This investigation was followed by a\n report, which disclosed the fullest confirmation of the acts which had been\n committed; to this no reply was made.\n \n ",
                "28":" And that these dramas should leave no awful tragic effect untried, this also was added after the \n curtain had dropped. \n Romanus, setting out to the Palace, brought with him Caecilius, who intended to\n accuse the judges of having been biased in favour of the province; and being\n received with favour by Merobaudes, he had sought that some more witnesses whom he needed\n should be produced. ",
                "29":" When these had come to\n Milan, and had shown by credible evidence that they had been brought there\n under false pretences to satisfy a grudge, they were discharged and returned to\n their homes. Nevertheless, in Valentinianus' lifetime, in consequence of what\n we have stated above, Remigius also after retiring into private life strangled\n himself, as I shall show in the proper place. \n \n "

For he was born of a clan famous in olden times in Gaul, liberally\n educated from earliest childhood, and so eminent for his modesty, good sense,\n refinement, charm, and learning that he always seemed superior to every office\n and rank that he was holding, and was\n dear alike to high and low.

                "24":" First, after some unimportant questions,\n Pergamius was called in, betrayed (as has been said) by Palladius of having foreknowledge of certain things through\n criminal incantations. Since he was very eloquent and was prone to say\n dangerous things, while the judges were in doubt what ought to be asked first\n and what last, he began to speak boldly, and shouted out in an endless flood\n the names of a very large number of men as accomplices, demanding that some be\n produced from all but the ends of the earth, to be accused of great crimes. He,\n as the contriver of too hard a task, was punished with death; and after him\n others were executed in flocks; then finally they came to\n the case of Theodorus himself, as if to the dusty arena of an Olympic contest.\n ",

In the beginning\n they were at variance with each other, but when their sides had been furrowed\n and the tripod which they were in the habit of using was brought in, they were\n driven into a corner, and gave a true account of the whole business, which they\n unfolded from its very beginning.

Now the manner of its working, whenever it was consulted about hidden\n matters, was as follows. It was placed in\n the middle of a house purified thoroughly with Arabic perfumes; on it was\n placed a perfectly round plate made of various metallic substances. Around\n its outer rim the written forms of the twenty-four letters of the alphabet\n were skilfully engraved, separated from one another by carefully measured\n spaces. Then a man clad in linen\n garments, shod also in linen sandals and having a fillet wound about his\n head, carrying twigs from a tree of good omen, after propitiating in a set\n formula the divine power from whom predictions come, having full knowledge\n of the ceremonial, stood over the tripod as priest and set swinging a\n hanging ring fitted to a very fine linen thread and consecrated with mystic arts. This ring, passing over the\n designated intervals in a series of jumps, and falling upon this and that\n letter which detained it, made hexameters corresponding with the questions\n and completely finished in feet and rhythm, like the Pythian verses which we\n read, or those given out from the oracles of the Branchidae. \n When we then and there inquired, 'what\n man will succeed the present emperor'?, since it was said that he would be\n perfect in every particular, and the ring leaped forward\n and lightly touched the two syllables θεο, \n adding the next letter, then one of those present cried out\n that by the decision of inevitable fate Theodorus was meant. And there was\n no further investigation of the matter; for it was agreed among us that he\n was the man who was sought. \n \n \n ",
                "29":" And when Hilarius had laid the knowledge of\n the whole matter so clearly before the eyes of the judges, he kindly added that\n Theodorus was completely ignorant of what was done. After this, being asked\n whether they had, from belief in the oracles which they practised, known\n beforehand what they were now suffering, they uttered those familiar verses\n which clearly announced that this work of inquiring into the superhuman would\n soon be fatal to them, but that nevertheless the Furies, breathing out death\n and fire, threatened also the emperor himself and his judges. Of these verses\n it will suffice to quote the last three: \n \n Avenged will be your blood. Against them too \n Tisiphonê's deep wrath arms evil fate, \n While Ares rages on the plain of Mimas. \n \n When these verses had been read, both were terribly torn by the hooks\n of the torturers and taken away senseless.

Accordingly, having first provided\n what the circumstances and the time demanded, and having learned from the\n reports of deserters where the said king, who expected no hostile move, could\n be seized, Valentinian threw a pontoon across the Rhine as quietly as his means\n allowed, lest anyone should interfere with the bridge while it was being put\n together.

                "3":" There he chanced to find some of the traders leading\n slaves intended for sale, and because he suspected that they would quickly run\n off and report what they had seen, he took their wares from them and killed them all. ",
                "4":" Then the generals, encouraged by the arrival of additional\n troops, encamped, with a view to a very short stay, since no one had a\n pack-animal or a tent, except the emperor, for whom a rug and a rough blanket\n sufficed for such a shelter. Then, after\n delaying for a time on account of the darkness of night, as soon as the\n morning-star uprose, since the campaign called for haste, they advanced\n farther, led by guides who knew the roads; and a large force of cavalry was\n ordered to precede them under command of Theodosius, that nothing might be\n unobserved . . . was\n lying at the time; but he was prevented by the continuous noise made by his\n men; for although he constantly commanded them to abstain \n from plundering and setting fires, he could not make them obey. For the\n crackling flames and the dissonant shouts awakened the king's attendants, and\n suspecting what had happened, they placed him in a swift wagon and hid him in a\n narrow pass of the precipitous hills.

                "5":"\n Valentinian was robbed of this glory, \n not by his own fault or that of his generals, but by the indiscipline of the\n soldiers, which has often caused the Roman state heavy losses; so, after\n reducing the enemy's territory to ashes for fifty miles, he returned sadly to Treves. ",
                "6":" There, as a lion, because he has lost a deer or a goat, gnashes his\n empty jaws, just when the forces of the enemy were broken and scattered by\n fear, in place of Macrianus he made Fraomarius king of the Bucinobantes, a\n tribe of the Alamanni dwelling opposite Mainz. And soon afterwards, since a\n recent invasion had utterly devastated that, canton, he transferred him to\n Britain with the rank of tribune, and gave him command of a troop of the Alamanni which at that\n time was distinguished for its numbers and its strength. Bitheridus, indeed,\n and Hortarius (chiefs of the same nation) he appointed to commands in the army;\n but of these Hortarius was betrayed by a report of Florentius, commander in\n Germany, of having written certain things to the detriment of the state to\n Macrianus and the chiefs of the barbarians, and after the truth was wrung from\n him by torture he suffered the penalty of death by burning.\n "

Of the latter Zammac, who was\n beloved by the general called Romanus, was\n secretly murdered by his brother Firmus, an act which occasioned dissensions\n and wars. For Romanus, hastening with extreme zeal to avenge his death,\n resorted to many formidable means for the destruction of the assassin; and, as\n persistent rumours divulged, even at court vigorous measures were taken to make\n sure that the reports of Romanus, which heaped up many serious charges against\n Firmus, should be gladly received and read out to the emperor; and many voices\n united in supporting these reports. But, on the contrary, the arguments which\n Firmus through his friends frequently presented in his defence for the purpose\n of saving his life, although they were received, were long concealed; for\n Remigius, at that time marshal of the court, a relative and friend of Romanus,\n declared that amid the more important and pressing business\n of the emperor such trivial and superfluous communications could not be read\n until opportunity offered.\n \n ",
                "2":" When the Moor perceived that these things\n were being done to break down his defence, he was now in dread of the worst;\n and fearing that the rebuttal which he offered would be set aside and he would\n be executed without a trial as dangerous and unruly, he revolted from the rule\n of the empire, and sought the help of neighbouring peoples . . . for\n devastating . . . \n ",
                "3":" To avert this danger before an implacable\n enemy should increase in strength, Theodosius, commander of the cavalry, was\n sent with the aid of a small body of the court troops, since in his merits (as\n a man efficient in accomplishing his ends) he surpassed all others of his time.\n He might well be compared with Domitius Corbulo and Lusius of old, of whom the former\n under Nero, the latter during Trajan's reign, were famed for many brave deeds.\n ",

During his\n stay in that town Theodosius was torn with twofold anxiety and turned over many\n things in his mind, considering by what way and by what devices he might lead\n his soldiers, who were accustomed to a cold climate, through lands parched with\n heat, or might capture an enemy who was a runabout, making sudden moves and\n trusting rather to secret ambuscades than to stand-up fights.\n \n ",
                "7":" When this became known to Firmus, at first\n through uncertain rumour and then through definite information, overcome by the\n arrival of so brilliant a general, he sent envoys with a letter to ask pardon\n and indulgence for what had happened, declaring that he had not of his own\n volition taken a hasty step which he knew to be criminal, but because of unjust\n and outrageous treatment by Romanus, as he promised to show.

There he aroused the hope of all\n by a lofty, but discreet, address, and returned to Sitifis, where he united the\n native troops and those which he himself had brought; then, impatient of\n further delay, he hastened with all speed to open the campaign.

From\n there he carefully examined into everything, so far as present circumstances\n allowed, and then advanced rapidly against the peoples of the Tyndenses and the\n Masinissenses, who were provided only with light arms and were led by Mascizel\n and Dius, brothers of Firmus.

The victor, elated by this success, with remarkable speed seized the\n town of Lamfoctum, situated among the aforesaid peoples, where he caused an\n abundance of provisions to be stored, so that if on penetrating farther into\n the country he met with a scarcity of food, he might order it to be brought\n from near at hand.

                "14":" Firmus, weakened by the losses of two\n battles and chafing in his inmost heart, in order not to neglect even one last\n measure, sent priests of the Christian sect with hostages to beg for peace.\n These were received courteously and, on their promise to furnish the\n necessities of life for the soldiers, as was ordered, they brought back a\n favourable reply and peace; whereupon the Moor himself, after sending presents,\n went with some confidence to the Roman general, mounted upon a horse that would\n prove useful in times of danger; and when he had come near, dazzled by the\n gleaming standards and the fear-inspiring expression of Theodosius, he sprang\n from his mount, and with bowed neck almost prostrate on the ground blamed with\n tears his rashness, and begged for pardon and peace.\n ",
                "15":" Being received with a kiss, since the\n interests of the state so demanded, he was now filled with joyful hope,\n furnished a sufficient amount of provisions, left some of his relatives by way\n of hostages, and went away, after agreeing to fulfil his promise and return the\n captives which he had taken at the very beginning of the rebellion. Two days\n later, without hesitation, he restored, as had been ordered, the town of\n Icosium, of whose founders I spoke before, the military standards, and the\n priestly crown, as well as the\n rest of the booty which he had taken.\n \n ",
                "16":" When after this our general had hurried\n through long marches and was now entering Tipasa, to envoys from the Mazices,\n who had joined with Firmus, and humbly begged for pardon, he replied with lofty\n spirit that he would at once take the field against them as traitors.\n ",
                "17":" And when they, paralysed with fear of the\n imminent danger, had been ordered to return to their homes, he went on to\n Caesarea, formerly a powerful\n and famous city, the origin of which I have also fully discussed in my\n description of the topography of Africa. On entering the city, and finding it almost wholly\n burned down from widespread fires, and the pavingstones white with mould, he\n decided to station the first and second legions there for a time, with orders to clear away the heaps of ashes and keep guard there,\n to prevent the place from being devastated by a renewed attack of the\n savages.\n \n ",
                "18":" When these events had been spread abroad by\n frequent and trustworthy rumours, the officials of the province and the tribune\n Vincentius came out of the hiding-places in which\n they had taken refuge, and at last, free from fear, quickly appeared before the\n general. He, after having seen and received them gladly, being then still at\n Caesarea, inquired carefully about the true state of affairs; he learned that\n Firmus, under pretence of fear and submission, was secretly forming the plan of\n throwing our army into confusion, as if by a sudden tempest, while it feared no\n hostile demonstration.

                "19":" Therefore he turned\n from there and came to the municipal town of Sugabarritanum, on the slope of\n the Transcellian mountain, where he found the horsemen of the fourth cohort of\n archers, which had gone over to the rebel; and to show that he was content with\n a somewhat mild punishment, he degraded them all to the lowest class of the\n service; then he ordered them and a part of the Constantian infantry, with their tribunes, one of whom had placed his\n neckchain, in place of a diadem, on Firmus' head, to come to Tigaviae.\n ",
                "20":" While this was going on, Gildo and\n Maximus returned, bringing Belles, one of the chiefs of the Mazices, and\n Fericius, prefect of the\n tribe, who had aided the party of the disturber of the public peace . . .\n ",
                "21":" When this had been\n done according to order, at daybreak he himself came out, and finding the\n rebels surrounded by his army, he said: What think you, my devoted\n comrades, ought to be done with these abominable traitors? And\n acceding to the acclamation of those who asked that they should pay for it with\n their blood, he turned over those who served among the Constantiani to the\n soldiers, to be slain in the oldfashioned way. But he had the hands of the leaders of the archers cut off and punished\n the rest with death, following the example of that strictest of leaders Curio,\n who put an end by a punishment of that kind to the wildness of\n the Dardani, when, like the Lernaean hydra, they constantly gained new life.\n ",
                "22":" But malevolent detractors, while praising\n that act of the olden time, find fault with this one as cruel and inhuman,\n declaring that the Dardani were murderous enemies and justly suffered the\n punishment which befell them, while these, on the contrary, were soldiers under\n the flag who had allowed themselves to commit a single fault and deserved to\n have been punished more leniently. But such folk we remind of what they perhaps\n do not know, that this cohort was harmful, not only in its action, but also in\n the example which it set. ",
                "23":" The aforesaid\n Belles and Fericius, whom Gildo had brought, and Curandius, tribune of the\n archers, he ordered to be put to death, the last named on the ground that he\n never wished either to engage with the enemy himself or to encourage his men to\n fight. Moreover, Theodosius did this bearing in mind the saying of Cicero: Wholesome strength is better than a vain\n show of mercy. \n \n \n \n ",
                "24":" Setting out from there, he came to an estate\n called Gaionatis, surrounded by a strong wall and hence a very safe refuge for\n the Moors. Against this he brought up his battering-rams and destroyed it,\n killing all the inhabitants and levelling the walls; then advancing over the\n Ancorarian mountain to Castellum Tingitanum, he attacked the Mazices, who were\n gathered together into one body and replied with missiles which came flying\n like hail. ",
                "25":" And after both sides had rushed\n in to the attack, the Mazices, though a warlike and hardy race, could not\n resist the columns of our men, charging with all their strength and weapons,\n but involved in heavy losses at various points fled in shameful terror; and as\n they rushed to escape all were cut down except those who found a means of\n getting away, and later by abject prayers obtained the pardon which\n circumstances made it advisable to grant. ",
                "26":"\n Suggen, when their leader . . . had succeeded Romanus, was\n ordered to go to Mauritania Sitifensis, in order to keep guard and prevent the\n province from being overrun, while he himself, encouraged by past successes,\n marched against the tribe of the Musones, which consciousness of their deeds of\n plunder and blood had joined with the enterprise of Firmus, since they hoped he\n would soon attain greater power.\n \n ",
                "27":" Having advanced some distance, near the 373\n f. municipal town of Adda Theodosius learned that a great number of tribes,\n differing in civilization and in variety of language, but united in their\n purpose, were stirring up the beginnings of cruel wars, instigated and abetted through very great hope of rewards by a sister of\n Firmus named Cyria, who, abounding in wealth and in feminine persistence, had\n resolved to make great efforts to aid her brother. ",
                "28":" Therefore Theodosius, fearing lest he should involve himself in an\n unequal contest, and if he confronted a vast horde with only a few troops—for\n he had under his command only 3500 armed men—might lose them all, wavered\n between the shame of retreat and the desire for battle; but at last he\n gradually withdrew and made off, with the horde pressing at his heels.\n ",
                "29":" The foe, tremendously elated by this\n success, followed persistently . . . so that he found it necessary to\n fight; but he himself would have been killed and his army utterly annihilated,\n had not the enemy, attacking in disorder, seen afar off the auxiliaries of the\n Mazices, in the van of which were some Romans; so thinking that they were\n attacked by many columns, they turned in flight and opened to our men ways of\n escape which before had been blocked. ",
                "30":" From\n there, leading his army safe and sound, Theodosius came to an estate called\n Mazucanus, where he burned a few deserters alive and mutilated the rest as he\n had the archers whose hands were cut off; and in\n the month of February he reached Tipasa. ",
                "31":"\n There he made a long halt, and after the manner of the famous Lingerer of old took\n counsel with himself as the circumstances demanded, planning, if chance gave\n the opportunity, rather through strategy and discretion than by the danger of battle, to overthrow an enemy who was pugnacious\n and effective in the use of missiles. ",
                "32":"\n Nevertheless he constantly sent men experienced in persuasion to the surrounding tribes, the Baiurae, Cantauriani,\n Avastomates, Cafaves, Bavares, and other neighbours, to entice them to an\n alliance, now by fear, now by bribes, and sometimes by promising pardon for\n their impudence with . . . intending by subterfuges and delays to overcome an enemy\n who foiled his attacks, as Pompey once vanquished Mithridates.\n \n ",
                "33":" Therefore Firmus, to avoid imminent\n destruction, although he was protected by a strong body of troops, abandoned\n the army which he had got together at great expense; and when the quiet of\n night gave him the opportunity of concealment, he made his way into the far\n distant Caprariensian mountains, which are inaccessible because of their steep\n crags. ",
                "34":" In consequence of his secret\n departure his army scattered and roamed about in small bands without a leader,\n thus giving our men the opportunity of invading their camp. After this was\n plundered and those who resisted were killed or received in surrender, the\n greater part of the country was devastated and our prudent leader put prefects\n of tried fidelity in charge of the peoples through whose country he was\n marching. ",
                "35":" The public enemy, terrified by\n this unexpected confidence of the pursuit, quickly departed, accompanied by a\n few slaves, in order to provide for his safety; and to \n prevent being impeded by any hindrance, he threw away packs containing valuable\n articles which he had carried off with him. For his wife, worn out by continual\n hardships and by dangers . . . ",
                "36":" Theodosius, sparing none of the\n enemy who came near, after refreshing his soldiers with better food and their\n pay, as well as disposing of the Caprarienses and their neighbours the Abanni\n in a slight skirmish, hastened to the municipal town of Audia. But having learned from trustworthy sources\n that the savages had already taken possession of hills which extended upwards\n in all directions in winding masses, and could be penetrated by no one except\n natives who were thoroughly acquainted with the locality, he retreated and\n thereby during the cessation of hostilities, brief though it was, gave the\n enemy an opportunity of being strengthened by very numerous auxiliaries from\n the Aethiopians who dwelt near by. ",
                "37":" When the\n foe, with united forces and threatening uproar, taking no thought for their own\n lives, rushed to battle, they drove off Theodosius in great terror at the\n fearful sight of their countless throngs. But he took courage and at once\n returned, bringing an abundance of provisions, and with his men in close order\n and brandishing their shields in a terrifying posture, met the enemy hand to\n hand. ",
                "38":" Then, although the bands of raging\n savages, blaring some ferocious tune on their barbaric trumpets and also\n clashing their bucklers against their knees, were close upon\n him, nevertheless, like a careful and discreet warrior, though distrusting the\n small number of his men, he formed a hollow square and then advanced\n boldly. Then he fearlessly turned aside to a city called Conta, where Firmus,\n since it was a concealed and lofty fortress, had placed those of our men whom\n he had captured. But Theodosius recovered them all, and severely punished the\n traitors and the attendants of Firmus, as was his custom.\n \n ",
                "39":" While he was thus most successful, with the\n aid of the mighty godhead, a trustworthy scout informed him that Firmus had\n fled to the Isaflenses; whereupon he invaded their lands, to demand the traitor\n as well as his brother Mazuca and the rest of his kinsfolk; and when his demand\n was refused, he declared war upon that race. ",
                "40":"\n A fierce battle followed, since the savages were uncommonly ferocious; but he\n opposed his army to them in circular formation and the Isaflenses were so overcome by the weight of\n the onrushing troops that many of them were slain. Firmus himself, after\n fighting bravely and often risking his life, was carried off in headlong flight\n by his horse, which was accustomed to run swiftly over rocks and crags; but his\n brother Mazuca was fatally wounded and taken prisoner. ",
                "41":" Theodosius gave orders to send Mazuca to Caesarea, a\n city on which the Moor had branded the savage marks of his evil deeds; but he\n tore open his wound and died. However, his head was torn off, leaving\n the rest of his body intact, and to the great joy of all who\n saw it was brought into the aforesaid city. ",
                "42":"\n After this our famous general overcame the race of the Isaflenses, who still\n resisted, and, as justice demanded, inflicted many vexatious penalties upon\n them. There Evasius, an important citizen, Florus his son, and some others, who\n were clearly convicted of having aided the violator of peace by secret counsel,\n were burned alive.\n \n ",
                "43":" Then Theodosius marched farther into the\n country, and with great courage attacked the tribe of the Iubaleni, to which he\n had learned that Nubel, the father of Firmus, belonged; but he was brought to a\n halt by the high mountains and the circuitous passes; and although he attacked\n the enemy and after killing many of them opened a way, yet dreading the high\n hills, so well adapted to ambuscades, he led his men back in safety to the\n fortress of Audia. There the wild race of the Iesalenses voluntarily\n surrendered, promising to furnish aid and provisions.\n \n ",
                "44":" The mighty leader, exulting in these and\n similar glorious actions, then went in quest of the disturber of peace himself\n with a mighty effort of strength. To that end he made a long halt near the\n castle of Medianum, hoping that through many carefully devised plans Firmus\n might be betrayed into his hands. ",
                "45":" While he\n was looking forward to this with perplexed thoughts and deep care, he found\n that his enemy had returned to the Isaflenses; whereupon he did not delay, as\n before, but attacked them with all the speed he could. Their king, Igmazen by\n name, who was highly regarded in those parts and notable for his resources,\n boldly came forward to meet him. What is your rank, said he, or what have you come here to do? Tell me. \n Theodosius, with stern glance and resolute mind, replied: I am the\n general of Valentinian, lord of the world, sent to destroy a murderous\n robber. Unless you give him up at once, as the invincible emperor has\n ordered, you will perish utterly with the race over which you rule. \n On hearing this, Igmazen, after heaping a flood of abuse upon the general,\n departed, full of wrath and resentment. ",
                "46":" At\n the first appearance of the following daylight both armies, with threatening\n mien, advanced to meet each other in battle. Nearly 20,000 savages were\n stationed in the very van, with bands of reserves concealed behind them, in\n order that they might gradually rise up and surround our men with their\n unexpected numbers. Besides these there were a great many auxiliaries from the\n Iesalenses, who, as we have pointed out, had promised help and provisions to\n our side. ",
                "47":" On the other hand, the Romans,\n although very few in number, nevertheless brave in spirit and encouraged by\n their former victories, pressed side to side in close order and with shields\n closely held together in the tortoise-formation, stood fast and resisted them; and the battle was\n continued from sunrise to the end of the day. A little before evening Firmus\n was seen, mounted on a tall horse, his purple cloak trailing out and spreading wide,\n urging our soldiers with loud shouts to take advantage of the opportunity and\n give up Theodosius, if they wished to be saved from the dangers to which they\n were exposed, calling him a fierce savage and a cruel deviser of inhuman\n punishments. ",
                "48":" These unexpected words roused\n some to fight more fiercely but induced others to abandon\n the battle. Accordingly, when the first quiet of night came, and the landscape\n was wrapped in fear-inspiring darkness, the general returned to the stronghold\n of Duodia, and, reviewing his soldiers, rid himself by various forms of\n punishment of those whom panic and the words of Firmus had turned from their\n duty in the battle; some had their right hands cut off, others were burned\n alive. ",
                "49":" And keeping watch by night with most\n vigilant care, he repulsed some of the barbarians who ventured to make an\n attempt on his camp after the setting of the moon, when they thought they could\n not be seen, or took prisoners those who rushed in too boldly. Then departing\n by quick marches and following by-paths, he attacked the Iesalenses from a\n quarter where they could least expect it, believing them to be of doubtful\n loyalty, and so devastated their lands that they were reduced to dire need;\n then he returned by way of the towns of Mauritania Caesariensis to Sitifis,\n where he tortured to the verge of death and then burned alive Castor and\n Martinianus, as sharers in the robberies and atrocities of Romanus.\n \n ",
                "50":" After this the war with the Isaflenses was\n renewed; and when in the first engagement great numbers of the savages were put\n to flight or killed, their king Igmazen, who had before been accustomed to\n victory, wavering through fear of the present danger, and thinking that because\n of his unlawful associations no hope of life was left\n him if be made obstinate resistance, rushed forth alone and with all possible\n caution and secrecy from the scene of the battle. When he came into the\n presence of Theodosius, he humbly begged that the general\n would order Masilla, a chief of the Mazices, to appear before him. ",
                "51":" When Masilla had been sent to Theodosius, as he had\n asked, the king through him, in a secret interview, urged the general, who by\n his own nature was inclined to resolution, that in order to provide himself\n with the means of accomplishing his desires, he should vigorously assail his\n fellow-countrymen, and by constant fighting reduce them to fear; he said that\n they were indeed inclined to favour the public enemy, but were wearied by their\n many losses. ",

At last, in accordance with a prearranged agreement,\n the one who is more confident in speech utters a kind of a sweet prologue,\n promising to emulate the ornamental language of a speech for\n Cluentius or Ctesiphon; and when all are wishing for the end, such is the method of his\n peroration that the advocates, after the semblance of a trial has gone on for\n three years, allege that they are not yet fully informed; and after they have\n obtained a further postponement, as if they had struggled with Antaeus\n of old, they persistently demand the\n pay for their danger and toil.\n \n ",

And when he learned that one had fallen victim to the noose, that\n another had gone across the sea, that a third had committed suicide or had died\n under the blows of the knout, he burned with\n tremendous rage, to which Leo, who was then chief marshal of the Court (oh,\n horror!), added blazing fuel, a man who himself aspired to the prefecture, in\n order to fall from a greater height.

And joining battle with the Alamanni near a place called Solicinium,\n where, after falling\n into an ambuscade and all but losing his life, he could have utterly destroyed\n their entire army, had not swift flight saved a few of them under cover of\n darkness.\n \n ",

In this he\n was quite unlike the famous Themistocles, for when after the fight with the\n Persians and the annihilation of their army \n the Athenian was aimlessly strolling about, and saw golden bracelets and a\n neck-chain lying on the ground, he turned to one of his attendants who stood\n near by and said: Pick up these, since you are not Themistocles, \n thus showing his scorn of any love of money in a noble leader.

But the barbarians sounded the glories of their\n forefathers with wild shouts, and amid this discordant\n clamour of different languages skirmishes were first tried. ",

The barbarians, who are always\n alert and nimble, threw at our men huge clubs, hardened in the fire, and ran their swords\n through the breasts of those who showed most resistance; thus they broke\n through the left wing. When this gave way, a strong troop of reserves bravely\n hastened to their aid from near at hand, and rallied them when death already\n sat upon their necks. ",
                "12":" Then the battle grew\n hot and the slaughter was great; all the more active rushed into the thick of\n the fray and met their death from the arrows that flew like hail, or from the\n swords. Those who fled were pursued on this side and on that by troops of\n cavalry, who with mighty strength slashed at their heads and backs; and\n likewise on both sides by foot soldiers, hamstringing those who were in the\n toils of fear and had fallen.\n ",
                "13":" And while the whole battlefield was\n covered with corpses, some were lying among them who were mortally wounded, and\n cherished a vain hope of life; some were smitten with a bullet from a sling or\n pierced with arrows tipped with iron; the heads of others were split through\n mid forehead and crown with swords and hung down on both shoulders, a most\n horrible sight.

                "14":" But not yet wearied bythe\n obstinate struggle, both sides continued to assail each other without a\n decision, and felt no diminution at all of their native\n hardihood, so long as eager courage kept up their strength. But at last day\n gave way to evening and ended the murderous contests, and withdrawing in\n disorder wherever each one could, all the survivors returned in sorrow to their\n tents. ",
                "15":" Finally, some of the dead, who were\n men of distinction, were buried in such manner as the present circumstances\n allowed; the bodies of the rest of the slain were devoured by the foul birds\n that are wont at such a time to feed upon corpses, as is shown by the plains\n even now white with bones. However,\n while it is a fact that the Romans, who, far fewer in number, struggled with\n that vast multitude, suffered great losses, yet lamentable was the distress\n with which they afflicted the barbarian horde.\n "

Among these also Potentius lost his life in the first flower of his\n youth; he was tribune of the promoti, \n respected by all good\n men and honoured both for his own services and those of his father Ursicinus,\n formerly a commander-in-chief.

He was a firm and faithful friend, severe in\n punishing ambitious designs, strict in maintaining discipline in the army and\n in civil life, always watchful and anxious lest anyone should elevate himself\n on the ground of kinship with him; he was excessively slow towards conferring\n or taking away official positions, very just in his rule of the provinces, each of which he\n protected from injury as he would his own house, lightening the burden of\n tributes with a kind of special care, allowing no increase in taxes, not\n extortionate in estimating the indebtedness from arrears, a harsh and bitter enemy of thievish officials and of those detected in peculation. Under no other emperor does the\n Orient recall meeting better treatment in matters of this kind. ",
                "2":" Besides all this, he combined liberality with\n moderation, and although there are many instances of such conduct, yet it will\n suffice to set forth one. Since there are always at court some men who are\n greedy for others' possessions, if anyone, as often happens, claimed a lapsed\n estate or anything else of the kind, he distinguished clearly between\n justice and injustice, allowing those who intended to protest a chance to state\n their case; and if he gave it to the petitioner, he often added as sharers in\n the gifts gained three or four absentees, to the end that restless people might\n act with more restraint, when they saw that by this device the gain for which\n they were so greedy was diminished.

                "5":" It was\n unendurable also, that although he wished to appear to refer all controversies\n and judicial investigations to the laws, and entrusted the examination of such\n affairs to the regular judges as being specially selected men, nevertheless he\n suffered nothing to be done contrary to his own caprice. He was in other ways\n unjust, hot tempered, and ready to listen to informers without distinguishing\n truth from falsity—a shameful fault, which is very greatly to be dreaded even\n in these our private affairs of every-day occurrence.\n \n ",

But with the soldiers the provincials and the court\n attendants rose up with all the greater vigour to overwhelm them, and such were\n the numbers of the foe that weapons of every kind, even though thrown at\n random, could not fall without effect.

For the chiefs,\n inflamed by a desire to carry off the treasures which Valens had acquired by\n his ill-gotten gains took their place in the foremost ranks and were followed\n by the rest, who made a display of equalling the dangers of their superiors.\n For some were writhing mortally wounded, either crushed by great masses of\n stone, or with their breasts pierced with javelins; others who carried\n scaling-ladders and were preparing to mount the walls from every side were\n buried under their own burdens, as stones, fragments and whole drums of columns\n were thrown down upon them.

                "1":" For he was a most\n brave and warlike man, whose father, Walamir, was called King of the Goths; but\n Theodoric was his natural son; his mother was called in Gothic Ereriliva,\n but being a Catholic received at her baptism the name Eusebia.\n ",
                "2":" Hence Theodoric was a man of great\n distinction and of good-will towards all men, and he ruled for thirty-three\n years. In his times Italy for thirty years enjoyed such good fortune that his\n successors also inherited peace. ",
                "3":" For\n whatever he did was good. He so governed two races at the same time, Romans and\n Goths, that although he himself was of the Arian sect, he nevertheless made no\n assault on the Catholic religion; he gave games in the circus and the\n amphitheatre, so that even by the Romans he was called a Trajan or a\n Valentinian, whose times he took as a model; and by the Goths, because of his\n edict, in which he established justice, he was judged to be in all respects\n their best king. Military service for the Romans he kept on the same footing as\n under the emperors. He was generous with gifts and the distribution of grain,\n and although he had found the public treasury nothing but a haystack,\n by his efforts it was restored and made rich.\n \n ",
                "4":" Although untrained in letters, he was\n nevertheless so wise that even now some of his sayings are\n regarded among the people as aphorisms, and for that reason I am glad to place\n on record a few out of many. He said, One who has gold and a demon\n cannot hide the demon. Also, A poor Roman plays the Goth, a\n rich Goth the Roman. \n \n \n ",
                "5":" A certain man died, leaving a wife and a\n little son who did not know his mother. Her son, when a small boy, was taken\n from her by some one, carried to another province, and there brought up. When\n he became a youth, he somehow returned to his mother, who had now become\n betrothed to another man. When the mother saw her son, she embraced him,\n thanking God that she had seen her son again, and he lived with her for a\n month. And behold! the mother's betrothed came, and seeing the young man, asked\n who he was. She replied that he was her son. But when her betrothed learned\n that the youth was her son, he began to ask the return of the earnest-money\n and to say:\n Either deny that he is your son, or I certainly depart hence. \n The mother yielded to her betrothed and began to deny her son, whom she herself\n had before acknowledged, saying: Leave my house, young man, since I took\n you up as a stranger. But he kept saying that he had come back to\n his mother and to the house of his father. To make a long story short, while\n this was going on the son appealed against his mother to the king, who ordered\n her to appear before him. And he said to her: Woman, your son appeals\n against you; what have you to say? Is he your son, or not? She\n replied: He is not my son, but I took him up as a\n stranger. And when the woman's son had told the whole story in order\n to the king, he again said to the woman: Is he your son, or not? \n She said: He is not my son. The king said to her: How\n much property have you, woman? She replied: As much as a\n thousand gold-pieces. And when the king declared with an oath that\n he would not make anyone else than the young man himself her husband, and that\n she should receive no other husband, then the woman was disconcerted and\n confessed that the young man was her son. And there\n are many other things told of the king.\n \n ",
                "6":" Afterwards Theodoric took to wife a Frankish woman named Augoflada. For\n before he began to reign he had a wife, \n who had borne him daughters. One of these, called Areaagni, he gave in marriage\n in Gaul to Alaric, king of the Visigoths, and another daughter of his,\n Theodegotha, to Sigismund, son of King Gundebadus. \n ",
                "7":" Theodoric, through Festus, made peace with\n the emperor Anastasius with regard to his assumption of the rule, and\n Anastasius sent back to him all the ornaments of the Palace, which Odoacar had\n transferred to Constantinople.\n \n ",
                "8":" At that same time a dispute arose in the\n city of Rome between Symmachus and Laurentius; for both had been consecrated. But through God's ordinance\n Symmachus, who also deserved it, got the upper hand. After peace was made in\n the city of the Church, King Theodoric went to Rome and met Saint Peter with as much reverence as if he himself were a Catholic. The Pope Symmachus, and the entire\n senate and people of Rome amid general rejoicing met him outside the city.\n ",
                "9":" Then coming to Rome and entering it, he\n appeared in the senate, and addressed the people at The Palm, \n promising that with God's help he would keep inviolate whatever the former\n Roman emperors had decreed.\n \n ",
                "10":" In celebration of his tricennalia \n he entered the Palace in a triumphal procession for the entertainment\n of the people, and exhibited games in the Circus for the Romans. To the Roman\n people and to the poor of the city he gave each year a hundred and twenty\n thousand measures of grain, and for the restoration of the Palace and the rebuilding of the walls of the city he ordered two hundred\n pounds to be given each year from the chest that contained the tax on wine.\n ",
                "11":" He also gave his own sister Amalafrigda\n in marriage to Transimundus, king of the Vandals. Liberius, whom he had\n appointed praetorian prefect at the beginning of his reign, he made a\n patrician, and appointed for him a successor. Now his successor in the administration of the prefecture was\n Theodorus, son of Basilus. Odoin, his general, made a plot against the king.\n ",
                "12":" When Theodoric learned of it, he had\n Odoin beheaded in the palace which is called the Sessorium. \n At the request of the people he gave orders that the words\n of the promise which he had made to them should be inscribed upon a bronze\n tablet and set up in a public place.\n \n ",
                "13":" Then returning to Ravenna, five months\n later, he gave Amalabirga, another sister of his, in marriage to Herminifred, king of the Turingi, and in that\n way gained peace with all the nations round about. He was besides a lover of\n building and restorer of cities. ",
                "14":" At Ravenna\n he repaired the aqueduct which the emperor Trajan had constructed, and thus\n brought water into the city after a long time. He completely finished the\n palace, but did not dedicate it. He completed the colonnades around the palace.\n He also built baths and a palace at Verona, and added a colonnade extending all\n the way from the gate to the Palace; besides that, he restored the aqueduct at\n Verona, which had long since been destroyed, and brought water into the city,\n as well as surrounding the city with new walls. Also at Ticinum he\n built a palace, baths, and an amphitheatre, besides \n new city walls.\n \n ",
                "15":" He also showed many favours to the other\n cities. And he so won the good-will of the neighbouring nations, that they\n offered to make treaties with him, in the hope that he would be their king.\n Indeed, merchants flocked to him from the various provinces, for his\n organization was such that if anyone wished to send\n consignments of gold or silver in his domain, it was deemed as good as if he\n were within the walls of a city. ",
                "16":" And he\n followed this principle so fully throughout all Italy, that he gave no city a\n gate; and where there were already gates, they were never shut; and every one\n could carry on his business at whatever hour he chose, as if it were in\n daylight. In his time sixty measures of wheat were bought for a single\n gold-piece, and thirty amphorae of wine for the same\n price.\n "

                "0":" Now at that same time the emperor Anastasius\n had three grandsons, namely, Pompeius, Probus, and Hypatius. Considering which\n one of them he should make his successor, he invited them to have luncheon with\n him one day, and after luncheon to take their midday siesta within the palace,\n where he had a couch prepared for each of them. Under the pillow on one couch\n he ordered the symbol of royalty to be put, and decided that whichever of them\n chose that couch for his nap, in him he ought to recognise the one to whom he\n should later turn over the rule. One of the grandsons threw himself down on one\n couch, but the other two, from brotherly affection, took their places together\n on another, and so it happened that none of them slept on the couch where the\n emblem of royalty had been placed. ",
                "1":" When\n Anastasius saw this, he began to ponder, and learning from it that none of them\n should rule, he began to pray to God that He would show him a sign, so that\n while he still lived he might know who should receive the royal power after his\n death. While he was considering the question with fasting and prayer, one night in a dream he saw a man, who advised him as follows:\n The person whose arrival shall first be announced to you tomorrow in\n your bedroom will be the one to receive your throne after you. \n ",
                "2":" Now it chanced that Justinus, who was\n commander of the watch, on coming to a place whither he had been directed to go \n by the emperor, was the first to be announced to him by his head-chamberlain.\n And when the king knew this, he began to thank God for having deigned to reveal\n to him who his successor should be.\n \n ",
                "3":" These words he\n kept to himself, but one day, when the emperor was in a procession, and\n Justinus wished to pass along quickly on one side of the emperor, in order to\n put his followers in line, he trod on the emperor's cloak. ",
                "4":" But the emperor only said to him: What is\n your hurry? \n Then in the last\n days of his reign the devil tempted him, wishing him to follow the Eunomian\n sect; but the people\n of the faith checked him and even cried out to him in the church: You\n shall not hurl your puny lance against the Trinity. Not long\n afterwards Anastasius was taken ill and confined to his bed in the city of\n Constantinople, and ended his last day.\n "

                "0":" Now King Theodoric was without training in\n letters, and of such dull comprehension that for ten years of his reign he had\n been wholly unable to learn the four letters necessary for endorsing his\n edicts. For that reason he had a golden plate with slits\n made, containing the four letters legi ; then, if he wished to endorse anything, he placed the plate over the\n paper and drew his pen through the slits, so that only this subscription of his\n was seen. \n \n \n ",
                "1":" Then Theodoric made Eutharicus consul and celebrated\n triumphs at Rome and at Ravenna. This Eutharicus was an excessively rough man,\n and an enemy to the Catholic faith. ",
                "2":" After\n this, while Theodoric was remaining at Verona through fear of the neighbouring\n peoples, strife arose between the Christians and the Jews of the city of\n Ravenna; accordingly the Jews, being unwilling to be baptised, often in sport\n threw the holy water that was offered to them into the water of the river.\n Because of this the people were fired with anger, and without respect for the\n king, for Eutharicus, or for Peter, who was bishop at the time, they rose\n against the synagogues and presently set them on fire. And this same thing\n happened in a similar affair at Rome.\n \n ",
                "3":" Presently the Jews hastened to Verona, where\n the king was, and there the head-chamberlain Triwane acted on their behalf; he,\n too, as a heretic favoured the Jews, and cajoled the king into taking action\n against the Christians. Accordingly Theodoric, on the presumption that they had\n resorted to arson, presently gave orders that the whole Roman population should furnish money for the rebuilding of the\n synagogues of Ravenna which had been burned; and that\n those who did not have anything from which they could give should be whipped\n through the\n streets of the city while a herald made proclamation of their offence. This was\n in substance the order given to Eutharicus, Cilliga, and the Bishop Peter, and\n thus it was carried out.\n \n ",
                "4":" Shortly after that the devil found an\n opportunity to steal for his own a man who was ruling the state well and\n without complaint. For presently Theodoric gave orders that an oratory of St.\n Stephen, that is, a high altar, beside the springs in a suburb of the city of\n Verona, should be destroyed. He also forbade any Roman to carry arms, except a\n small pen-knife. ",
                "5":" Also a poor woman of the\n Gothic race, lying in a colonnade not far from the palace at Ravenna, gave\n birth to four snakes; two of these in the sight of the people were carried up\n on clouds from west to east and then fell into the sea; the two others, which\n had but a single head, were taken away. A star with a train of fire appeared,\n of the kind called a comet, and shone for\n fifteen days. There were frequent earthquakes.\n \n ",
                "6":" After this the king began from time to time,\n when he found an opportunity, to vent his rage upon the Romans. Cyprianus, who\n was then a referee, afterwards count of the\n privy purse and a master, was led by avarice to make a charge against the patrician Albinus, to\n the effect that he had sent to the emperor Justinus a letter hostile to\n Theodoric's rule. When Albinus was summoned and denied this,\n the patrician Boethius, who was master of ceremonies, said in the king's\n presence: The charge of Cyprianus is false, but if Albinus did that, so\n also have I and the whole senate with one accord done it; it is false, my\n Lord King. \n ",
                "7":" Then Cyprianus, after some hesitation,\n produced false witnesses, not only against Albinus, but against his defender\n Boethius. Moreover, the king was plotting evil against the Romans and seeking\n an opportunity for killing them; hence he trusted the false witnesses rather\n than the senators. ",
                "8":" Then Albinus and Boethius\n were imprisoned in the baptistery of a church. And the king summoned Eusebius,\n prefect of the city, to Ticinum, and pronounced sentence on Boethius without\n giving him a hearing. Presently at the Calventian estate, \n where Boethius was confined, he had him put to a wretched death. He was tortured for a long\n time with a cord bound about his forehead so tightly that his eyes cracked in\n their sockets, and finally, while under torture, he was beaten to death with a\n cudgel.\n "

But anything else which you may enjoin upon me with God's help\n I shall be able to obtain from him. \n ",

But God, who does not desert his faithful worshippers,\n conducted them in safety. ",

                "4":" But while all this was going on, Symmachus,\n the head of the senate, whose daughter Boethius had married, was brought from\n Rome to Ravenna. There the king, fearing that through resentment at the death\n of his son-in-law, Symmachus might\n take some step in opposition to his rule, ordered him to be\n put to death under a false accusation.

When the people were marching before his dead body, suddenly one\n of the crowd was possessed by a devil and fell down; but when they had come,\n with the coffin in which Johannes was carried, to the place where the stricken\n man lay, he suddenly got up sound and well and took his place in the front of\n the funeral procession. When the people and the senators beheld this, they\n began to take relics from the Pope's\n garments. Then the body was escorted out of the city attended by the great\n rejoicing of the people.\n "
