For there is a place in\noratory for almost every word, with the exception\nonly of a very few, which are not sufficiently seemly.\nSuch words are indeed often praised when they\noccur in writers of iambics or of the old comedy,\n\n\n\nbut we need do no more than consider our own\nspecial task.

But, although a store\nof words may be acquired by these means, we must\nnot read or listen to orators merely for the sake of\nacquiring words. For in everything which we teach\nexamples are more effective even than the rules\nwhich are taught in the schools, so long as the\nstudent has reached a stage when he can appreciate\nsuch examples without the assistance of a teacher,\nand can rely on his own powers to imitate them.\nAnd the reason is this, that the professor of rhetoric\nlays down rules, while the orator gives a practical\ndemonstration."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "17"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "18"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "19"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.13"}, "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "claque"}, "#text": "But the advantages conferred by reading and\nlistening are not identical.

He is like\nhis own conception of Ocean, which he describes as\nthe source of every stream and river; for he has\ngiven us a model and an inspiration for every\ndepartment of eloquence. It will be generally admitted that no one has ever surpassed him in the\nsublimity with which he invests great themes or the\npropriety with which he handles small. He is at\nonce luxuriant and concise, sprightly and serious,\nremarkable at once for his fullness and his brevity,\nand supreme not merely for poetic, but for oratorical\npower as well. For, to say nothing of his eloquence,\nwhich he shows in praise, exhortation and consolation, do not the ninth book containing the embassy\nto Achilles, the first describing the quarrel between\nthe chiefs, or the speeches delivered by the counsellors in the second, display all the rules of art\nto be followed in forensic or deliberative oratory?\nAs regards the emotions, there can be no one so illeducated as to deny that the poet was the master of all,\ntender and vehement alike. Again, in the few lines\nwith which he introduces both of his epics, has he\nnot, I will not say observed, but actually established\nthe law which should govern the composition of the\nexordium? For, by his invocation of the goddesses\nbelieved to preside over poetry he wins the goodwill\nof his audience, by his statement of the greatness\nof his themes he excites their attention and renders\nthem receptive by the briefness of his summary.\nWho can narrate more briefly than the hero who\nbrings the news of Patroclus' death, or more vividly\nthan he who describes the battle between the\nCuretes and the Aetolians? Then consider his\n\n\n\nsimiles, his amplifications, his illustrations, digressions, indications of fact, inferences, and all the\nother methods of proof and refutation which he\nemploys. They are so numerous that the majority\nof writers on the principles of rhetoric have gone to\nhis works for examples of all these things. And as\nfor perorations, what can ever be equal to the prayers\nwhich Priam addresses to Achilles when he comes\nto beg for the body of his son? Again, does he not\ntranscend the limits of human genius in his choice\nof words, his reflexions, figures, and the arrangement\nof his whole work, with the result that it requires a\npowerful mind, I will not say to imitate, for that is\nimpossible, but even to appreciate his excellences?\nBut he has in truth outdistanced all that have come\nafter him in every department of eloquence, above\nall, he has outstripped all other writers of epic, the\ncontrast in their case being especially striking owing\nto the similarity of the material with which they\ndeal. Hesiod rarely rises to any height, while a\ngreat part of his works is filled almost entirely with\nnames: none the less, his maxims of moral wisdom\nprovide a useful model, the smooth flow of his\nwords and structure merit our approval, and he\nis assigned the first place among writers of the\nintermediate style. On the other hand, Antimachus\ndeserves praise for the vigour, dignity and elevation of his language. But although practically all\nteachers of literature rank him second among epic\npoets, he is deficient in emotional power, charm, and\narrangement of matter, and totally devoid of real\nart. No better example can be found to show what\na vast difference there is to being near another\nwriter and being second to him. Panyasis is\n\n\n\nregarded as combining the qualities of the last two\npoets, being their inferior in point of style, but\nsurpassing Hesiod in the choice of his subject and\nAntimachus in its arrangement. Apollonius is not\nadmitted to the lists drawn up by the professors\nof literature, because the critics, Aristarchus and\nAristophanes, included no contemporary poets.\nNone the less, his work is by no means to be\ndespised, being distinguished by the consistency\nwith which he maintains his level as a representative of the intermediate type. The subject\nchosen by Aratus is lifeless and monotonous, affording no scope for pathos, description of character,\nor eloquent speeches. However, he is adequate for\nthe task to which he felt himself equal. Theocritus\nis admirable in his own way, but the rustic and\npastoral muse shrinks not merely from the forum,\nbut from town-life of every kind. I think I hear\nmy readers on all sides suggesting the names of\nhosts of other poets. What? Did not Pisandros\ntell the story of Hercules in admirable style?\nWere there not good reasons for Virgil and Macer\ntaking Nicander as a model? Are we to ignore\nEuphorion? Unless Virgil had admired him, he\nwould never have mentioned\n\n\n\nin the  Again, had Horace no justification\nfor coupling the name of Tyrtacus with that of\nHomer? To which I reply, that there is no one so\nignorant of poetic literature that he could not, if he\nchose, copy a catalogue of such poets from some\n\n\n\nlibrary for insertion in his own treatises. I can\ntherefore assure my readers that I am well aware\nof the existence of the poets whom I pass over in\nsilence, and am far from condemning them, since I\nhave already said that some profit may be derived\nfrom every author. But we must wait till our\npowers have been developed and established to the\nfull before we turn to these poets, just as at banquets\nwe take our fill of the best fare and then turn\nto other food which, in spite of its comparative\ninferiority, is still attractive owing to its variety.\nNot until our taste is formed shall we have leisure\nto study the elegiac poets as well. Of these, Callimachus is regarded as the best, the second place\nbeing, according to the verdict of most critics,\noccupied by Philetas. But until we have acquired\nthat assured facility of which I spoke, we must\nfamiliarise ourselves with the best writers only and\nmust form our minds and develop an appropriate tone\nby reading that is deep rather than wide. Consequently, of the three writers of iambics approved by\nthe judgment of Aristarchus, Archilochus will be far\nthe most useful for the formation of the facility in\nquestion. For he has a most forcible style, is full of\nvigorous, terse and pungent reflexions, and overflowing with life and energy: indeed, some critics\nthink that it is due solely to the nature of his\nsubjects, and not to his genius, that any poets are to\nbe ranked above him. Of the nine lyric poets\nPindar is by far the greatest, in virtue of his inspired\nmagnificence, the beauty of his thoughts and figures,\nthe rich exuberance of his language and matter,\nand his rolling flood of eloquence, characteristics\nwhich, as Horace rightly held, make him\n\n\n\ninimitable. The greatness of the genius of Stesichorus\nis shown by his choice of subject: for he sings of the\ngreatest wars and the most glorious of chieftains,\nand the music of his lyre is equal to the weighty\nthemes of epic poetry. For both in speech and\naction he invests his characters with the dignity\nwhich is their due, and if he had only been capable\nof exercising a little more restraint, he might,\nperhaps, have proved a serious rival to Homer.\nBut he is redundant and diffuse, a fault which,\nwhile deserving of censure, is nevertheless a defect\nspringing from the very fullness of his genius.\nAlcaeus has deserved the compliment of being said\nto make music with  in that portion\nof his works in which he attacks the tyrants of his\nday and shows himself a real moral force. He is,\nmoreover, terse and magnificent in style, while the\nvigour of his diction resembles that of oratory. But\nhe also wrote poetry of a more sportive nature and\nstooped to erotic poetry, despite his aptitude for\nloftier themes. Simonides wrote in a simple style,\nbut may be recommended for the propriety and\ncharm of his language. His chief merit, however,\nlies in his power to excite pity, so much so, in fact,\nthat some rank him in this respect above all writers\nof this class of poetry."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "65"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "66"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "67"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "68"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "69"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "70"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "71"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "72"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.39"}, {"@id": "p.41"}, {"@id": "p.43"}], "note": ["Contemporaries: Cratinus (519422), Aristophanes (448\n380), Eupolis (446410).", "A contemporary of Demosthenos; his speeches have not\nsurvived, but were considered to resemble those of Lysias.", {"quote": ["The Arbitrators,", "The Heiress,", "The Locri,", "The Timid Man,", "The Lawgiver,", "The\nChangeling."], "#text": "The greater portion of the Epitrepontes has been recovered from a papyrus.

For its style\nis at once lofty, elegant and graceful, and if we\nexcept Homer, who, like Achilles among warriors,\n\n\n\nis beyond all comparison, I am not sure that there\nis any style which bears a closer resemblance to\noratory or is better adapted for forming the orator.\nThere are a number of writers of the old comedy,\nbut the best are Aristophanes, Eupolis and Cratinus. Aeschylus was the first to bring tragedy into\nprominence: he is lofty, dignified, grandiloquent\noften to a fault, but frequently uncouth and inharmonious. Consequently, the Athenians allowed\nlater poets to revise his tragedies and to produce\nthem in the dramatic contests, and many succeeded\nin winning the prize by such means. Sophocles\nand Euripides, however, brought tragedy to far\ngreater perfection: they differ in style, but it is\nmuch disputed as to which should be awarded the\nsupremacy, a question which, as it has no bearing\non my present theme, I shall make no attempt to\ndecide. But this much is certain and incontrovertible, that Euripides will be found of far greater service\nto those who are training themselves for pleading in\ncourt. For his language, although actually censured\nby those who regard the dignity, the stately\nstride and sonorous utterance of Sophocles as being\nmore sublime, has a closer affinity to that of oratory,\nwhile he is full of striking reflexions, in which,\nindeed, in their special sphere, he rivals the\nphilosophers themselves, and for defence and attack may be compared with any orator that has\nwon renown in the courts. Finally, although admirable in every kind of emotional appeal, he is\neasily supreme in the power to excite pity.\nMenander, as he often testifies in his works, had\na profound admiration for Euripides, and imitated\nhim, although in a different type of work. Now,\n\n\n\nthe careful study of Menander alone would, in my\nopinion, be sufficient to develop all those qualities\nwith the production of which my present work\nis concerned; so perfect is his representation of\nactual life, so rich is his power of invention and\nhis gift of style, so perfectly does he adapt himself\nto every kind of circumstance, character and emotion. Indeed, those critics are no fools who think\nthe speeches attributed to Charisius were in reality\nwritten by Menander. But I consider that he shows\nhis power as an orator far more clearly in his\ncomedies; since assuredly we can find no more\nperfect models of every oratorical quality than the\njudicial pleadings of his Epitrepontes, Epicleros\nand Locri, or the declamatory speeches in the Psophodes, Nomothetes. and Hypobolimaeus. Still, for\nmy own part, I think that he will be found even more\nuseful by declaimers, in view of the fact that they\nhave, according to the nature of the various controversial themes, to undertake a number of different\nroles and to impersonate fathers, sons, soldiers,\npeasants, rich men and poor, the angry man and\nthe suppliant, the gentle and the harsh. And all\nthese characters are treated by this poet with\nconsummate appropriateness. Indeed, such is his\nsupremacy that he has scarce left a name to other\nwriters of the new comedy, and has cast them into\ndarkness by the splendour of his own renown.\nStill, you will find something of value in the other\ncomic poets as well, if you read them in not too\ncritical a spirit; above all, profit may be derived\nfrom the study of Philemon, who, although it was\n\n\n\na depraved taste which caused his contemporaries\noften to prefer him to Menander, has none the\nless deserved the second place which posterity has\nbeen unanimous in awarding him."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "73"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "74"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "75"}], "note": [{"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Hellenica"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Philippica"}], "#text": "Theopompus of Chios, born about 378 B.C., wrote a\nhistory of Greece () from close of Peloponnesian war\nto 394 B.C., and a history of Greece in relation to Philip of\nMacedon ().

As among\nGreek authors Homer provided us with the most\nauspicious opening, so will Virgil among our own.\nFor of all epic poets, Greek or Roman, he, without\ndoubt, most nearly approaches to Homer. I will\nrepeat the words which I heard Domitius Afer use\nin my young days. I asked what poet in his opinion\ncame nearest to Homer, and he replied,  And\nin truth, although we must needs bow before the\nimmortal and superhuman genius of Homer, there\nis greater diligence and exactness in the work\nof Virgil just because his task was harder. And\nperhaps the superior uniformity of the Roman's excellence balances Homer's pre-eminence in his outstanding passages. All our other poets follow a long\nway in the rear. Macer and Lucretius are, it is true,\nworth reading, but not for the purpose of forming\nstyle, that is to say, the body of eloquence: both\ndeal elegantly with their themes, but the former is\ntame and the latter difficult. The poems by which\nVarro of Atax gained his reputation were translations, but he is by no means to be despised, although\nhis diction is not sufficiently rich to be of much\n\n\n\nservice in developing the resources of eloquence.\nEnnius deserves our reverence, but only as those\ngroves whose age has made them sacred, but whose\nhuge and ancient trunks inspire us with religious\nawe rather than with admiration for their beauty.\nThere are other poets who are nearer in point of\ntime and more useful for our present purpose. Ovid\nhas a lack of seriousness even when he writes epic\nand is unduly enamoured of his own gifts, but\nportions of his work merit our praise. On the other\nhand, although Cornelius Severus is a better versifier\nthan poet, yet if, as has been said, he had written his\npoem on the Sicilian war in the same style throughout\nas his first book, he would have had a just claim to the\nsecond place. A premature death prevented the\npowers of Serranus from ripening to perfection, but\nhis youthful works reveal the highest talent and a\ndevotion to the true ideal of poetry, which is remarkable in one so young. We have suffered serious loss\nin the recent death of Valerius Flaccus. Saleius\nBassus showed an ardent and genuinely poetic\ngenius, but, like that of Serranus, it was not\nmellowed by years.

I know well\nenough what a storm I shall raise by this assertion,\nmore especially since I do not propose for the\nmoment to compare him with Demosthenes; for\nthere would be no point in such a comparison, as I\nconsider that Demosthenes should be the object of\nspecial study, and not merely studied, but even committed to memory. I regard the excellences of these\ntwo orators as being for the most part similar, that\nis to say, their judgment, their gift of arrangement,\ntheir methods of division, preparation and proof, as\nwell as everything concerned with invention. In\ntheir actual style there is some difference. Demosthenes is more concentrated, Cicero more diffuse;\nDemosthenes makes his periods shorter than Cicero,\nand his weapon is the rapier, whereas Cicero's periods\nare longer, and at times he employs the bludgeon as\nwell: nothing can be taken from the former, nor\nadded to the latter; the Greek reveals a more\nstudied, the Roman a more natural art. As regards\nwit and the power of exciting pity, the two most\npowerful instruments where the feelings are concerned, we have the advantage. Again, it is possible\n\n\n\nthat Demosthenes was deprived by national custom\nof the opportunity of producing powerful perorations, but against this may be set the fact that the\ndifferent character of the Latin language debars us\nfrom the attainment of those qualities which are\nso much admired by the adherents of the Attic\nschool. As regards their letters, which have in\nboth cases survived, and dialogues, which Demosthenes never attempted, there can be no comparison\nbetween the two. But, on the other hand, there is\none point in which the Greek has the undoubted\nsuperiority: he comes first in point of time, and it\nwas largely due to him that Cicero was able to attain\ngreatness. For it seems to me that Cicero, who\ndevoted himself heart and soul to the imitation of\nthe Greeks, succeeded in reproducing the force of\nDemosthenes, the copious flow of Plato, and the\ncharm of Isocrates. But he did something more\nthan reproduce the best elements in each of these\nauthors by dint of careful study; it was to himself\nthat he owed most of, or rather all his excellences,\nwhich spring from the extraordinary fertility of his\nimmortal genius. For he does not, as Pindar says,\n since Providence at his birth conferred\nthis special privilege upon him, that eloquence should\nmake trial of all her powers in him. For who can\ninstruct with greater thoroughness, or more deeply\nstir the emotions? Who has ever possessed such a\ngift of charm? He seems to obtain as a boon what\nin reality he extorts by force, and when he wrests\nthe judge from the path of his own judgment, the\nlatter seems not to be swept away, but merely to\nfollow. Further, there is such weight in all that he\n\n\n\nsays that his audience feel ashamed to disagree with\nhim, and the zeal of the advocate is so transfigured\nthat it has the effect of the sworn evidence of a\nwitness, or the verdict of a judge. And at the same\ntime all these excellences, of which scarce one could\nbe attained by the ordinary man even by the most\nconcentrated effort, flow from him with every appearance of spontaneity, and his style, although no fairer\nhas ever fallen on the ears of men, none the less\ndisplays the utmost felicity and ease. It was not,\ntherefore, without good reason that his own contemporaries spoke of his  at the bar, and\nthat for posterity the name of Cicero has come to be\nregarded not as the name of a man, but as the name\nof eloquence itself. Let us, therefore, fix our eyes on\nhim, take him as our pattern, and let the student realise\nthat he has made real progress if he is a passionate\nadmirer of Cicero. Asinius Pollio had great gifts of\ninvention and great precision of language (indeed,\nsome think him too precise), while his judgment\nand spirit were fully adequate. But he is so far from\nequalling the polish and charm of Cicero that he\nmight have been born a generation before him.\nMessala, on the other hand, is polished and transparent and displays his nobility in his utterance,\nbut he fails to do his powers full justice. As\nfor Gaius Caesar, if he had had leisure to devote\nhimself to the courts, he would have been the one\norator who could have been considered a serious rival\nto Cicero. Such are his force, his penetration and\nhis energy that we realise that he was as vigorous in\nspeech as in his conduct of war. And yet all these\nqualities are enhanced by a marvellous elegance of\nlanguage, of which he was an exceptionally zealous\n\n\n\nstudent. Caelius has much natural talent and much\nwit, more especially when speaking for the prosecution, and deserved a wiser mind and a longer life.\nI have come across some critics who preferred\nCalvus to all other orators, and others again who\nagreed with Cicero that too severe self-criticism had\nrobbed him of his natural vigour. But he was the\npossessor of a solemn, weighty and chastened style,\nwhich was also capable at times of genuine vehemence. He was an adherent of the Attic school and\nan untimely death deprived him of his full meed of\nhonour, at least if we regard him as likely to have\nacquired fresh qualities. Servius Sulpicius acquired\na great and well-deserved reputation by his three\nspeeches. Cassius Severus, if read with discrimination, will provide much that is worthy of imitation:\nif to his other merits he had added appropriateness\nof tone and dignity of style, he would deserve a\nplace among the greatest. For his natural talents\nare great, his gift of bitterness, wit and passion\nremarkable, but he allowed the sharpness of his\ntemper to prevail over his judgment. Moreover,\nthough his jests are pungent enough, this very\npungency often turned the laugh against himself.\nThere are many other clever speakers, but it\nwould be a long task to deal with them all. Domitius\nAfer and Julius Africanus are by far the most distinguished. The former is superior in art and in\nevery department of oratory, indeed he may he\nranked with the old orators without fear of\n\n\n\ncontradiction. The latter shows greater energy, but is too\ngreat a precisian in the choice of words, prone to\ntediously long periods and somewhat extravagant in\nhis metaphors. There have been distinguished\ntalents even of more recent date. For example,\nTrachalus was, as a rule, elevated and sufficiently\nclear in his language: one realised that his aims\nwere high, but he was better to listen to than to\nread. For his voice was, in my experience, unique\nin its beauty of tone, while his delivery would have\ndone credit to an actor, his action was full of grace\nand he possessed every external advantage in profusion. Vibius Crispus, again, was well-balanced,\nagreeable and born to charm, though he was better\nin private than in public cases. Julius Secundus,\nhad he lived longer, would undoubtedly have attained\na great and enduring reputation. For he would have\nacquired, as he was actually acquiring, all that was\nlacking to his qualities, namely, a far greater\npugnacity and a closer attention to substance as well\nas form. But, in spite of the untimeliness of his end,\nhe occupies a high place, thanks to his fluency, the\ngrace with which he set forth whatever he desired,\nthe lucidity, smoothness and beauty of his speech,\nthe propriety revealed in the use of words, even\nwhen employed figuratively, and the point which\ncharacterises even his most hazardous expressions.\nSubsequent writers on the history of oratory will\nfind abundant material for praise among the orators\nwho flourish to-day: for the law courts can boast\na glorious wealth of talent. Indeed, the consummate advocates of the present day are serious\nrivals of the ancients, while enthusiastic effort\nand lofty ideals lead many a young student\n\n\n\nto tread in their footsteps and imitate their\nexcellence."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "123"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "124"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "125"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "126"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "127"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "128"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "129"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "130"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "131"}], "note": ["Brutus, omitted from Qauintilian's list of orators, was a\nfollower of the Stoic and Academic schools.

Among the Stoics\nPlautus is useful as giving a knowledge of the\nsubject. Among the Epicureans Catius is agreeable to read, though lacking in weight. I have\ndeliberately postponed the discussion of Seneca in\nconnexion with the various departments of literature\nowing to the fact that there is a general, though\nfalse, impression that I condemn and even detest\nhim. It is true that I had occasion to pass censure upon him when I was endeavouring to recall\nstudents from a depraved style, weakened by every\nkind of error, to a severer standard of taste. But\nat that time Seneca's works were in the hands\nof every young man, and my aim was not to ban his\nreading altogether, but to prevent his being preferred to authors superior to himself, but whom he\nwas never tired of disparaging; for, being conscious\nof the fact that his own style was very different\n\n\n\nfrom theirs, he was afraid that he would fail to\nplease those who admired them. But the young\nmen loved him rather than imitated him, and fell\nas far below him as he fell below the ancients. For\nI only wish they had equalled or at least approached\nhis level. But he pleased them for his faults alone,\nand each individual sought to imitate such of those\nfaults as lay within his capacity to reproduce: and\nthen brought reproach on his master by boasting\nthat he spoke in the genuine Senecan manner.\nSeneca had many excellent qualities, a quick and\nfertile intelligence with great industry and wide\nknowledge, though as regards the last quality he\nwas often led into error by those whom he had\nentrusted with the task of investigating certain\nsubjects on his behalf. He dealt with almost every\ndepartment of knowledge; for speeches, poems,\nletters and dialogues all circulate under his name.\nIn philosophy he showed a lack of critical power,\nbut was none the less quite admirable in his\ndenunciations of vice. His works contain a number\nof striking general reflexions and much that is\nworth reading for edification; but his style is for\nthe most part corrupt and exceedingly dangerous,\nfor the very reason that its vices are so many and\nattractive. One could wish that, while he relied on\nhis own intelligence, he had allowed himself to be\nguided by the taste of others. For if he had only\ndespised all unnatural expressions and had not been\nso passionately fond of all that was incorrect, if he\nhad not felt such affection for all that was his own,\nand had not impaired the solidity of his matter by\nstriving after epigrammatic brevity, he would have\nwon the approval of the learned instead of the\n\n\n\nenthusiasm of boys. But even as it is, he deserves\nto be read by those whose powers have been formed\nand firmly moulded on the standards of a severer\ntaste, if only because he will exercise their critical\nfaculties in distinguishing between his merits and\nhis defects. For, as I have said, there is much in\nhim which we may approve, much even that we may\nadmire. Only we must be careful in our selection:\nwould he had been as careful himself.

It is a positive disgrace to be\ncontent to owe all our achievement to imitation.\nFor what, I ask again, would have been the result\nif no one had done more than his predecessors?\nLivius Andronicus would mark our supreme\nachievement in poetry and the annals of the  would be our  in history. We\n\n\n\nshould still be sailing on rafts, and the art of painting\nwould be restricted to tracing a line round a shadow\nthrown in the sunlight. Cast your eyes over the\nwhole of history; you will find that no art has\nremained just as it was when it was discovered, nor\ncome to a standstill at its very birth, unless indeed\nwe are ready to pass special condensation on our\nown generation on the ground that it is so barren of\ninvention that no further development is possible;\nand it is undoubtedly true that no development is\npossible for those who restrict themselves to imitation. But if we are forbidden to add anything to\nthe existing stock of knowledge, how can we ever\nhope for the birth of our ideal orator? For of all\nthe greatest orators with whom we are as yet acquainted, there is not one who has not some\ndeficiency or blemish. And even those who do\nnot aim at supreme excellence, ought to press\ntoward the mark rather than be content to follow\nin the tracks of others. For the man whose aim\nis to prove himself better than another, even if he\ndoes not surpass him, may hope to equal him. But\nhe can never hope to equal him, if he thinks it his\nduty merely to tread in his footsteps: for the mere\nfollower must always lag behind. Further, it is\ngenerally easier to make some advance than to\nrepeat what has been done by others, since there\nis nothing harder than to produce an exact likeness,\nand nature herself has so far failed in this endeavour\nthat there is always some difference which enables\nus to distinguish even the things which seem most\nlike and most equal to one another. Again, whatever is like another object, must necessarily be\ninferior to the object of its imitation, just as the\n\n\n\nshadow is inferior to the substance, the portrait to\nthe features which it portrays, and the acting of the\nplayer to the feelings which he endeavours to reproduce. The same is true of oratory. For the models\nwhich we select for imitation have a genuine and\nnatural force, whereas all imitation is artificial and\nmoulded to a purpose which was not that of the\noriginal orator. This is the reason why declamations\nhave less life and vigour than actual speeches, since\nthe subject is fictitious in the one and real in the\nother. Again, the greatest qualities of the orator\nare beyond all imitation, by which I mean, talent,\ninvention, force, facility and all the qualities which\nare independent of art. Consequently, there are\nmany who, after excerpting certain words from\npublished speeches or borrowing certain particular\nrhythms, think that they have produced a perfect\ncopy of the works which they have read, despite\nthe fact that words become obsolete or current\nwith the lapse of years, the one sure standard being\ncontemporary usage; and they are not good or\nbad in virtue of their inherent nature (for in themselves they are no more than mere sounds), but\nsolely in virtue of the aptitude and propriety (or\nthe reverse) with which they are arranged, while\nrhythmical composition must be adapted to the\ntheme in hand and will derive its main charm from\nits variety."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "17"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "18"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.83"}, {"@id": "p.85"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cp.

At first, our pen must be slow yet sure: we\nmust search for what is best and refuse to give a\njoyful welcome to every thought the moment that\nit presents itself; we must first criticise the fruits of\nour imagination, and then, once approved, arrange\nthem with care. For we must select both thoughts\nand words and weigh them one by one. This done,\n\n\n\nwe must consider the order in which they should be\nplaced, and must examine all the possible varieties\nof rhythm, refusing necessarily to place each word in\nthe order in which it occurs to us. In order to do\nthis with the utmost care, we must frequently revise\nwhat we have just written. For beside the fact that\nthus we secure a better connexion between what\nfollows and what precedes, the warmth of thought\nwhich has cooled down while we were writing is\nrevived anew, and gathers fresh impetus from going\nover the ground again. We may compare this protess with what occurs in jumping matches. The\ncompetitors take a longer run and go at full speed\nto clear the distance which they aim at covering;\nsimilarly, in throwing the javelin, we draw back our\narms, and in archery pull back the bow-string to\npropel the shaft. At times, however, we may\nspread our sails before the favouring breeze, but we\nmust beware that this indulgence does not lead us\ninto error. For we love all the offspring of our\nthought at the moment of their birth; were that\nnot so, we should never commit them to writing.\nBut we must give them a critical revision, and go\ncarefully over any passage where we have reason to\nregard our fluency with suspicion. It is thus, we\nare told, that Sallust wrote, and certainly his works\ngive clear evidence of the labour which he expended\non them. Again, we learn from Varius that Virgil\ncomposed but a very small number of verses every\nday. It is true that with orators the case is somewhat different, and it is for this reason that I\nenjoin such slowness of speed and such anxious care\nat the outset. For the first aim which we must fix\nin our minds and insist on carrying into execution\n\n\n\nis to write as well as possible; speed will come with\npractice. Gradually thoughts will suggest themselves with increasing readiness, the words will\nanswer to our call and rhythmical arrangement will\nfollow, till everything will be found fulfilling its\nproper function as in a well-ordered household.\nThe sum of the whole matter is this: write quickly\nand you will never write well, write well and you\nwill soon write quickly. But it is just when we\nhave acquired this facility that we must pause awhile\nto look ahead and, if I may use the metaphor, curb\nthe horses that would run away with us. This will\nnot delay our progress so much as lend us fresh\nvigour. For I do not think that those who have\nacquired a certain power in writing should be condemned to the barren pains of false self-criticism.\nHow can anyone fulfil his duties as an advocate if he\nwastes his time in putting unnecessary finish on each\nportion of his pleadings? There are some who are\nnever satisfied. They wish to change everything\nthey have written and to put it in other words.\nThey are a diffident folk, and deserve but ill of their\nown talents, who think it a mark of precision to cast\nobstacles in the way of their own writing. Nor is it\neasy to say which are the most serious offenders, those\nwho are satisfied with everything or those who are\nsatisfied with nothing that they write. For it is\nof common occurrence with young men, however\ntalented they may be, to waste their gifts by superfluous elaboration, and to sink into silence through\nan excessive desire to speak well. I remember in\nthis connexion a story that Julius Secundus, my contemporary, and, as is well known, my very dear friend,\na man with remarkable powers of eloquence, but\n\n\n\nwith an infinite passion for precision, told me of the\nwords once used to him by his uncle, Julius Florus,\nthe leading orator of Gaul, for it was there that he\npractised, a man eloquent as but few have ever\nbeen, and worthy of his nephew. He once noticed\nthat Secundus, who was still a student, was looking\ndepressed, and asked him the meaning of his frowns.\nThe youth made no concealment of the reason: he\nhad been working for three days, and had been unable, in spite of all his efforts, to devise an exordium\nfor the theme which he had been given to write,\nwith the result that he was not only vexed over\nhis immediate difficulty, but had lost all hope of\nfuture success. Florus smiled and said,  There\nlies the truth of the whole matter. We must aim\nat speaking as well as we can, but must not try to\nspeak better than our nature will permit. For to\nmake any real advance we need study, not selfaccusation. And it is not merely practice that will\nenable us to write at greater length and with\nincreased fluency, although doubtless practice is\nmost important. We need judgement as well. So\nlong as we do not he back with eyes turned up to the\nceiling, trying to fire our imagination by muttering\nto ourselves, in the hope that something will present\nitself, but turn our thoughts to consider what the\ncircumstances of the case demand, what suits the\ncharacters involved, what is the nature of the occasion and the temper of the judge, we shall acquire\nthe power of writing by rational means. It is thus\nthat nature herself bids us begin and pursue our\nstudies once well begun. For most points are of a\ndefinite character and, if we keep our eyes open,\n\n\n\nwill spontaneously present themselves. That is the\nreason why peasants and uneducated persons do not\nbeat about the bush to discover with what they\nshould begin, and our hesitation is all the more\nshameful if it is simply the result of education.\nWe must not, therefore, persist in thinking that\nwhat is hard to find is necessarily best; for, if it\nseems to us that there is nothing to be said except\nthat which we are unable to find, we must say\nnothing at all. On the other hand, there is a fault\nwhich is precisely the opposite of this, into which\nthose fall who insist on first making a rapid draft\nof their subject with the utmost speed of which\ntheir pen is capable, and write in the heat and\nimpulse of the moment. They call this their rough\ncopy. They then revise what they have written,\nand arrange their hasty outpourings. But while\nthe words and the rhythm may be corrected, the\nmatter is still marked by the superficiality resulting\nfrom the speed with which it was thrown together.\nThe more correct method is, therefore, to exercise\ncare from the very beginning, and to form the\nwork from the outset in such a manner that it\nmerely requires to be chiselled into shape, not\nfashioned anew.

Demosthenes took a wiser view; for he would retire to\na place where no voice was to be heard, and no\nprospect greeted the sight, for fear that his eyes\nmight force his mind to neglect its duty. Therefore, let the burner of the midnight oil seclude\nhimself in the silence of night, within closed doors,\nwith but a solitary lamp to light his labours. But\nfor every kind of study, and more especially for\nnight work, good health and its chief source, simple\nliving, are essential; for we have fallen into the\nhabit of devoting to relentless labour the hour which\nnature has appointed for rest and relaxation. From\nthose hours we must take only such time as is superfluous for sleep, and will not be missed. For fatigue\nwill make us careless in writing, and the hours of\ndaylight are amply sufficient for one who has no\nother distractions.

Correction\ntakes the form of addition, excision and alteration.\nBut it is a comparatively simple and easy task to\ndecide what is to be added or excised. On the\nother hand, to prune what is turgid, to elevate\nwhat is mean, to repress exuberance, arrange what\nis disorderly, introduce rhythm where it is lacking,\nand modify it where it is too emphatic, involves a\ntwofold labour. For we have to condemn what had\npreviously satisfied us and discover what had escaped\nour notice. There can be no doubt that the best\nmethod of correction is to put aside what we have\nwritten for a certain time, so that when we return\nto it after an interval it will have the air of novelty\nand of being another's handiwork; for thus we may\nprevent ourselves from regarding our writings with\nall the affection that we lavish on a newborn child.\nBut this is not always possible, especially in the case\nof an orator who most frequently has to write for\nimmediate use, while some limit, after all, must be\nset to correction. For there are some who return\nto everything they write with the presumption that\nit is full of faults and, assuming that a first draft\nmust necessarily be incorrect, think every change\nan improvement and make some alteration as often\nas they have the manuscript in their hands: they\nare, in fact, like doctors who use the knife even\nwhere the flesh is perfectly healthy.

Nay, we may add the vigour of oratory\nto the thoughts expressed by the poet, make good\nhis omissions, and prune his diffuseness.

Consequently,\nI disagree with those who forbid the student to\nparahrase speeches of our own orators, on the\nground that, since all the best expressions have\nalready been appropriated, whatever we express\ndifferently must necessarily be a change for the\nworse. For it is always possible that we may discover expressions which are an improvement on\nthose which have already been used, and nature\ndid not make eloquence such a poor and starveling\nthing, that there should be only one adequate\nexpression for any one theme. It can hardly be\nargued that, while the gestures of the actor are\ncapable of imparting a wealth of varied meaning\n\n\n\nto the same words, the power of oratory is restricted\nto a narrower scope, so that when a thing has once\nbeen said, it is impossible to say anything else on\nthe same theme. Why, even if it be granted that\nno new expression we discover can be better than\nor even equal to the old, it may, at any rate, be\na good second.

For what difference is there between the\nspecial case where Cornelius, the tribune of the\npeople, is charged with reading the text of a proposed law, and the general question whether it is\n for a magistrate himself to read the\nlaw which he proposes to the people; what does it\nmatter whether we have to decide whether Milo was\njustified in killing Clodius, or whether it is justifiable to kill a man who has set an ambush for his\nslayer, or a citizen whose existence is a danger to\nthe state, even though he has set no such ambush?\nWhat difference is there between the question\nwhether it was an honourable act on the part of\nCato to make over Marcia to Hortensius, or whether\nsuch an action is becoming to a virtuous man?

There is yet\nanother method of exercising this faculty: it consists\nin going over our subjects in their entirety in silent\nthought, although we must all the time formulate\nthe words to ourselves: such practice is possible at\nany moment or place that finds us unoccupied, and\nis, in some respects, more useful than that which I\nhave just mentioned; for we are more careful about\nour composition than when we are actually speaking\nand in momentary fear of interrupting the continuous\nflow of our language.

For whatever is becoming is, as a\nrule, useful, and there is nothing that does more to\nconciliate the good-will of the judge than the\nobservance or to alienate it than the disregard of\nthese considerations. Sometimes, however, the two\nare at variance. Now, whenever this occurs, expediency must yield to the demands of what is\nbecoming. Who is there who does not realise that\nnothing would have contributed more to secure the\nacquittal of Socrates than if he had employed the\nordinary forensic methods of defence and had\nconciliated the minds of his judges by adopting a\nsubmissive tone and had devoted his attention to\nrefuting the actual charge against him? But such\na course would have been unworthy of his character,\n\n\n\nand, therefore, he pleaded as one who would account\nthe penalty to which he might be sentenced as the\nhighest of honours. The wisest of men preferred to\nsacrifice the remnant of his days rather than to cancel\nall his past life. And since he was but ill understood by the men of his own day, he reserved his\ncase for the approval of posterity and at the cost of\na few last declining years achieved through all the\nages life everlasting. And so although Lysias, who\nwas accounted the first orator of that time, offered\nhim a written defence, he refused to make use of\nit, since, though he recognised its excellence, he\nregarded it as unbecoming to himself. This instance alone shows that the end which the orator\nmust keep in view is not persuasion, but speaking\nwell, since there are occasions when to persuade\nwould be a blot upon his honour. The line adopted\nby Socrates was useless to secure his acquittal, but\nwas of real service to him as a man; and that is by\nfar the greater consideration. In drawing this distinction between what is expedient and what is\nbecoming, I have followed rather the usage of common speech than the strict law of truth; unless,\nindeed, the elder Africanus is to be regarded as\nhaving failed to consult his true interests, when he\nretired into exile sooner than wrangle over his own\ninnocence with a contemptible tribune of the people,\nor unless it be alleged that Publius Rutilius was\nignorant of his true advantage both on the occasion\nwhen he adopted a defence which may almost be\ncompared with that of Socrates, and when he preferred to remain in exile rather than return at Sulla's\nbidding. No, these great men regarded all those\ntrifles that the most abject natures regard as\n\n\n\nadvantageous, as being contemptible if weighed in the\nbalance with virtue, and for this reason they have\ntheir reward in the deathless praise of all generations. Let not us, then, be so poor spirited as to\nregard the acts, which we extol, as being inexpedient.\nHowever, it is but rarely that this distinction, such\nas it is, is called into play. As I have said, the\nexpedient and the becoming will, as a rule, be\nidentical in every kind of case. Still, there are two\nthings which will be becoming to all men at all times\nand in all places, namely, to act and speak as befits a\nman of honour, and it will never at any time beseem\nany man to speak or act dishonourably. On the\nother hand, things of minor importance and occupying something like a middle position between the\ntwo are generally of such a nature that they may be\nconceded to some, but not to others, while it will\ndepend on the character of the speaker and the\ncircumstances of time, place and motive whether we\nregard them as more or less excusable or reprehensible.

Consequently, we may regard\nhis frequent reference to the deeds accomplished\nin his consulship as being due quite as much to the\nnecessities of defence as to the promptings of vainglory. As regards his own eloquence, he never\nmade immoderate claims for it in his pleading, while\nhe always paid a handsome tribute to the eloquence\nof the advocate, who opposed him. For example,\nthere are passages such as the following:  and,  Again, in his speech against\nCaecilius on the selection of an accuser for Verres,\ndespite the fact that the question as to which was\nthe most capable pleader, was a factor of great\nimportance, he rather depreciated his opponent's\neloquence than exalted his own, and asserted that\nhe had done all in his power to make himself an\norator, though he knew he had not succeeded. In\nhis letters to intimate friends, it is true, and occasionally in his dialogues, he tells the truth of his own\neloquence, though in the latter case he is careful\nalways to place the remarks in question in the\nmouth of some other character. And yet I am not\nsure that open boasting is not more tolerable, owing\nto its sheer straightforwardness, than that perverted\nform of self-praise, which makes the millionaire say\nthat he is not a poor man, the man of mark describe\nhimself as obscure, the powerful pose as weak,\nand the eloquent as unskilled and even inarticulate.\nBut the most ostentatious kind of boasting takes\nthe form of actual self-derision. Let us therefore\nleave it to others to praise us. For it beseems us,\nas Demosthenes says, to blush even when we are\npraised by others. I do not mean to deny that\nthere are occasions when an orator may speak of\nhis own achievements, as Demosthenes himself does\nin his defence of Ctesiphon. But on that occasion\nhe qualified his statements in such a way as to show\nthat he was compelled by necessity to do so, and to\nthrow the odium attaching to such a proceeding on\nthe man who had forced him to it.

Can sorrow be\nexpressed in epigram? Or will  or\n avail to win the judge's mercy? Will\nnot all embellishment of pure emotion merely impair its force and dispel compassion by such a display\nof apparent unconcern? Or, suppose that a father\nhas to speak of his son's death, or of some wrong\nthat is worse than death, will he, in making his statement of facts, seek to achieve that grace in exposition which is secured by purity and lucidity of\nlanguage, and content himself with setting forth\nhis case in due order with brevity and meaning?\nOr will he count over the heads of his argument\nupon his fingers, aim at niceties of division and\nproposition, and speak without the least energy of\nfeeling as is usual in such portions of a speech?\nWhither will his grief have fled while he is thus\nengaged?

And yet sometimes it is absolutely necessary, as, for example, in the case of Cluentius Habitus.\nBut it is not always desirable to employ the method\nadopted by Cicero against Sasia, not because he did not\nmake most admirable use of it, but because in such\ncases it makes the greatest difference what the point\nmay be and what the manner in which the mother\nseeks to injure her son. In the case of Sasia she hat\nopenly sought to procure the destruction of her son,\nand consequently vigorous methods were justified\nagainst her. But there were two points, the only\npoints which remained to be dealt with, that were\nhandled by Cicero with consummate skill: in the\nfirst place, he does not forget the reverence that is\ndue to parents, and in the second, after a thorough\ninvestigation of the history of the crime, he makes\nit clear that it was not merely right, but a positive\nnecessity that he should say what he proposed to\nsay against the mother. And he placed this explantation in the forefront of his case, although it\nhad really nothing to do with the actual question at\nissue; a fact which shows that his first consideration\nin that difficult and complicated case was the consideration of what was becoming for him to say. He\ntherefore made the name of mother cast odium not\non the son, but on her who was the object of his\ndenunciations. It is, however, always possible that a\n\n\n\nmother may be her son's opponent in a case of less\nserious import, or at any rate in a way which involves\nless deadly hostility. Under such circumstances the\norator must adopt a gentler and more restrained\ntone. For example, we may offer apology for the\nline which we take, and thus lessen the odium\nwhich we incur or even transfer it to a different\nquarter, while if it be obvious that the son is deeply\ngrieved by the situation, it will be believed that he\nis blameless in the matter and he will even become\nan object of pity. It will also be desirable to throw\nthe blame on others, so that it may be believed that\nthe mother's action was instigated by their malice,\nand to assert that we will put up with every form of\nprovocation, and will say nothing harsh in reply, so\nthat, even although strong language may be absolutely necessary on our part, we may seem to be\ndriven to use it against our will. Nay, if some\ncharge has to be made against the mother, it will be\nthe advocate's task to make it seem that he does so\nagainst the desire of the son and from a sense of\nduty to his client. Thus both son and advocate will\nwin legitimate praise. What I have said about\nmothers will apply to either parent; for I have\nknown of litigation taking place between fathers\nand sons as well, after the  of the son.\nAnd when other relationships are concerned, we\nmust take care to create the impression that we\nhave spoken with reluctance and under stress of\nnecessity and that we have been forbearing in our\nlanguage; but the importance of so doing will vary\naccording to the respect due to the persons concerned. The same courtesy should be observed in\nspeaking on behalf of freedmen against their patrons.\n\n\n\nIn fact, to sum up, it will never become us to plead\nagainst such persons in a tone which we ourselves\nshould have resented in the mouth of men of like\ncondition. The same respect is on occasion due to\npersons of high rank, and it may be necessary to\noffer justification for our freedom of speech to avoid\ngiving the impression that we have shown ourselves\ninsolent or ostentatious in our attack upon such\npersons. Consequently Cicero, although he intended\nto speak against Cotta with the utmost vehemence,\nand indeed the case of Publius Oppius was such that\nhe could not do otherwise, prefaced his attack by\npleading at some length the necessity imposed upon\nhim by his duty to his client. Sometimes, again, it\nwill beseem us to spare or seem to spare our inferiors,\nmore especially if they be young. Cicero gives an\nexample of such moderation in the way in which he\ndeals with Atratinus in his defence of Caelius: he\ndoes not lash him like an enemy, but admonishes\nhim almost like a father. For Atratinus was of\nnoble birth and young, and the grievance which led\nhim to bring the accusation was not unreasonable."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "69"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "70"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "71"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "72"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "73"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "74"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.197"}, {"@id": "p.199"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Pro Muren."}, "#text": "vii. 15."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Pro Muren."}, "#text": "xxix. 60."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "sqq."}, "#text": "Ch. 17"}], "#text": "But the task is comparatively easy in those cases\nin which it is to the judge, or even, it may be, to our\naudience that we have to indicate the reason for our\nmoderation. The real difficulty arises when we are\nafraid of offending those against whom we are\nspeaking. The difficulties of Cicero when defending\nMurena were increased by the fact that he was\nopposed by two persons of this character, namely\nMarcus Cato and Servius Sulpicius. And yet in\nwhat courteous language, after allowing Sulpicius all\nthe virtues, he refuses to admit that he has any idea\nof the way to conduct a candidature for the\n\n\n\nconsulship. What else was there in which a man of high\nbirth and a distinguished lawyer would sooner\nadmit his inferiority?

And with what a light touch he deals with\nCato! He has the highest admiration for his\ncharacter and desires to show that the fact that in\ncertain respects it has become severe and callous is due\nnot to any personal fault, but to the influence of the\nStoic school of philosophy; in fact you would imagine\nthat they were engaged not in a forensic dispute,\nbut merely in some philosophical discussion. This\nis undoubtedly the right method, and the safest rule\nin such cases will be to follow the practice of Cicero,\nnamely, that, when we desire to disparage a man\nwithout giving offence, we should allow him to be\nthe possessor of all other virtues and point out that\nit is only in this one respect that he falls short of\nhis high standard, while we should, if possible, add\nsome reason why this should be so, such, for example,\nas his being too obstinate or credulous or quick to\nanger, or acting under the influence of others.\n(For we may generally find a way out of such embarrassments by making it clear throughout our\nwhole speech that we not merely honour the object\nof our criticism, but even regard him with affection.)\nFurther, we should have good cause for speaking thus\nand must do so not merely with moderation, but also\ngive the impression that our action is due to the\nnecessities of the case.

In the case of\nfreedmen we should disparage their influence: but\nwe may also give them credit for the industry\nwhich secured their emancipation. With regard\nto foreign nations, Cicero's practice varies. When\nhe intends to disparage the credibility of Greek\nwitnesses he admits their distinction in learning\nand literature and professes his admiration for their\nnation.

Some regard memory as being no more than\none of nature's gifts; and this view is no doubt true\nto a great extent; but, like everything else, memory\n\n\n\nmay be improved by cultivation. And all the labour\nof which I have so far spoken will be in vain unless\nall the other departments be co-ordinated by the\nanimating principle of memory. For our whole\neducation depends upon memory, and we shall\nreceive instruction all in vain if all we hear slips\nfrom us, while it is the power of memory alone\nthat brings before us all the store of precedents,\nlaws, rulings, sayings and facts which the orator\nmust possess in abundance and which he must\nalways hold ready for immediate use. Indeed\nit is not without good reason that memory has\nbeen called the treasure-house of eloquence. But\npleaders need not only to be able to retain a number\nof facts in their minds, but also to be quick to take\nthem in; it is not enough to learn what you have\nwritten by dint of repeated reading; it is just as\nnecessary to follow the order both of matter and\nwords when you have merely thought out what you\nare going to say, while you must also remember\nwhat has been said by your opponents, and must\nnot be content merely with refuting their arguments\nin the order in which they were advanced, but must\nbe in a position to deal with each in its appropriate\nplace. Nay, even extempore eloquence, in my\nopinion, depends on no mental activity so much\nas memory. For while we are saying one thing, we\nmust be considering something else that we are\ngoing to say: consequently, since the mind is always\nlooking ahead, it is continually in search of something which is more remote: on the other hand,\nwhatever it discovers, it deposits by some mysterious\nprocess in the safe-keeping of memory, which acts\nas a transmitting agent and hands on to the delivery\n\n\n\nwhat it has received from the imagination. I do\nnot conceive, however, that I need dwell upon the\nquestion of the precise function of memory, although\nmany hold the view that certain impressions are\nmade upon the mind, analogous to those which a\nsignet-ring makes on wax. Nor, again, shall I be so\ncredulous, in view of the fact that the retentiveness\nor slowness of the memory depends upon our\nphysical condition, as to venture to allot a special\nart to memory. My inclination is rather to marvel\nat its powers of reproducing and presenting a\nnumber of remote facts after so long an interval,\nand, what is more, of so doing not merely when we\nseek for such facts, but even at times of its own\naccord, and not only in our waking moments, but\neven when we are sunk in sleep. And my wonder is\nincreased by the fact that even beasts, which seem to\nbe devoid of reason, yet remember and recognise\nthings, and will return to their old home, however far\nthey have been taken from it. Again, is it not an\nextraordinary inconsistency that we forget recent and\nremember distant events, that we cannot recall what\nhappened yesterday and yet retain a vivid impression\nof the acts of our childhood? And what, again, shall\nwe say of the fact that the things we search for\nfrequently refuse to present themselves and then\noccur to us by chance, or that memory does not\nalways remain with us, but will even sometimes\nreturn to us after it has been lost? But we should\nnever have realised the fullness of its power nor its\nsupernatural capacities, but for the fact that it is\nmemory which has brought oratory to its present\nposition of glory. For it provides the orator not\nmerely with the order of his thoughts, but even of\n\n\n\nhis words, nor is its power limited to stringing\nmerely a few words together; its capacity for endurance is inexhaustible, and even in the longest\npleadings the patience of the audience flags long\nbefore the memory of the speaker. This fact may\neven be advanced as an argument that there must\nbe some art of memory and that the natural gift can\nbe helped by reason, since training enables us to\ndo things which we cannot do before we have had\nany training or practice. On the other hand, I find\nthat Plato asserts that the use of written characters\nis a hindrance to memory, on the ground, that is, that\nonce we have committed a thing to writing, we\ncease to guard it in our memory and lose it out of\nsheer carelessness. And there can be no doubt that\nconcentration of mind is of the utmost importance in\nthis connexion; it is, in fact, like the eyesight, which\nturns to, and not away from, the objects which it\ncontemplates. Thus it results that after writing\nfor several days with a view to acquiring by heart\nwhat we have written, we find that our mental effort\nhas of itself imprinted it on our memory."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "14"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "15"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}], "note": ["See x. i. 64.", {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Or."}, "#text": "Cic.

For he had scarcely crossed the\nthreshold on his way out, when the banqueting hall\nfell in upon the heads of the guests and wrought\nsuch havoc among them that the relatives of the\ndead who came to seek the bodies for burial were\nunable to distinguish not merely the faces but even\nthe limbs of the dead. Then it is said, Simonides,\nwho remembered the order in which the guests had\nbeen sitting, succeeded in restoring to each man his\nown dead. There is, however, great disagreement\namong our authorities as to whether this ode was\nwritten in honour of Glaucus of Carystus, Leocrates,\nAgatharcus or Scopas, and whether the house was\nat Pharsalus, as Simonides himself seems to indicate\nin a certain passage, and as is recorded by Apollodorus, Eratosthenes, Euphorion and Eurypylus of\nLarissa, or at Crannon, as is stated by Apollas\nCallimachus, who is followed by Cicero, to whom\nthe wide circulation of this story is due.

For when we\nreturn to a place after considerable absence, we not\nmerely recognise the place itself, but remember\nthings that we did there, and recall the persons\nwhom we met and even the unuttered thoughts\nwhich passed through our minds when we were\nthere before. Thus, as in most cases, art originates in experiment. Some place is chosen of the\nlargest possible extent and characterised by the\nutmost possible variety, such as a spacious house\ndivided into a number of rooms. Everything of\nnote therein is carefully committed to the memory,\nin order that the thought may be enabled to run\nthrough all the details without let or hindrance.\nAnd undoubtedly the first task is to secure that\nthere shall be no delay in finding any single detail,\nsince an idea which is to lead by association to\nsome other idea requires to be fixed in the mind\nwith more than ordinary certitude. The next step\nis to distinguish something which has been written\ndown or merely thought of by some particular\nsymbol which will serve to jog the memory; this\nsymbol may have reference to the subject as a\nwhole, it may, for example, be drawn from navigation, warfare, etc., or it may, on the other hand,\nbe found in some particular word.

What\nI have spoken of as being done in a house, can\nequally well be done in connexion with public\nbuildings, a long journey, the ramparts of a city,\nor even pictures.

Such\na practice may perhaps have been of use to those\nwho, after an auction, have succeeded in stating\nwhat object they had sold to each buyer, their statements being checked by the books of the money takers; a feat which it is alleged was performed by\nHortensius. It will, however, be of less service in\nlearning the various parts of a set speech. For\nthoughts do not call up the same images as material\nthings, and a symbol requires to be specially invented\nfor them, although even here a particular place may\nserve to remind us, as, for example, of some conversation that may have been held there. But how\ncan such a method grasp a whole series of connected words? I pass by the fact that there are\ncertain things which it is impossible to represent by\n\n\n\nsymbols, as, for example, conjunctions. We may, it\nis true, like shorthand writers, have definite symbols\nfor everything, and may select an infinite number\nof places to recall all the words contained in the\nfive books of the second pleading against Verres,\nand we may even remember them all as if they\nwere deposits placed in safe-keeping.

I am not, however, prepared to recommend any definite length; it will depend on the natural limits of the passage concerned,\nunless, indeed, it be so long as itself to require subdivision.

This device bears\nsome resemblance to the mnemonic system which\nI mentioned above, but if my experience is worth\nanything, is at once more expeditious and more\neffective. The question has been raised as to\nwhether we should learn by heart in silence; it\nwould be best to do so, save for the fact that under\nsuch circumstances the mind is apt to become indolent, with the result that other thoughts break in.\nFor this reason the mind should be kept alert by the\nsound of the voice, so that the memory may derive\nassistance from the double effort of speaking and\nlistening. But our voice should be subdued, rising\nscarcely above a murmur. On the other hand, if we\nattempt to learn by heart from another reading\naloud, we shall find that there is both loss and gain;\non the one hand, the process of learning will be\nslower, because the perception of the eye is quicker\nthan that of the ear, while, on the other hand, when\nwe have heard a passage once or twice, we shall be\nin a position to test our memory and match it against\nthe voice of the reader. It is, indeed, important for\nother reasons to test ourselves thus from time to time,\nsince continuous reading has this drawback, that it\npasses over the passages which we find hard to remember at the same speed as those which we find less\ndifficulty in retaining. By testing ourselves to see\n\n\n\nwhether we remember a passage, we develop greater\nconcentration without waste of time over the repetition of passages which we already know by heart.\nThus, only those passages which tend to slip from\nthe memory are repeated with a view to fixing them\nin the mind by frequent rehearsal, although as a rule\nthe mere fact that they once slipped our memory\nmakes us ultimately remember them with special\naccuracy. Both learning by heart and writing have\nthis feature in common: namely, that good health,\nsound digestion, and freedom from other preoccupations of mind contribute largely to the success of\nboth. But for the purpose of getting a real grasp\nof what we have written under the various heads,\ndivision and artistic structure will be found of great\nvalue, while, with the exception of practice, which\nis the most powerful aid of all, they are practically\nthe only means of ensuring an accurate remembrance\nof what we have merely thought out. For correct\ndivision will be an absolute safeguard against error in\nthe order of our speech, since there are certain points\nnot merely in the distribution of the various questions\nin our speech, but also in their development (provided we speak as we ought), which naturally come\nfirst, second, and third, and so on, while the connexion\nwill be so perfect that nothing can be omitted or\ninserted without the fact of the omission or insertion being obvious. We are told that Scaevola,\nafter a game of draughts in which he made the first\nmove and was defeated, went over the whole game\nagain in his mind on his way into the country, and\non recalling the move which had cost him the game,\nreturned to tell the man with whom he had been\nplaying, and the latter acknowledged that he was\n\n\n\nright. Is order, then, I ask you, to be accounted of\nless importance in a speech, in which it depends\nentirely on ourselves, whereas in a game our opponent\nhas an equal share in its development? Again, if\nour structure be what it should, the artistic sequence will serve to guide the memory. For just\nas it is easier to learn verse than prose, so it is\neasier to learn prose when it is artistically constructed than when it has no such organisation. If\nthese points receive attention, it will be possible to\nrepeat  even such psssages as gave the impression of being delivered extempore. My own\nmemory is of a very ordinary kind, but I found that\nI could do this with success on occasions when the\ninterruption of a declamation by persons who had a\nclaim to such a courtesy forced me to repeat part of\nwhat I had said.

The most important thing is to learn\nmuch by heart and to think much, and, if possible,\nto do this daily, since there is nothing that is more\nincreased by practice or impaired by neglect than\nmemory. Therefore boys should, as I have already\nurged, learn as much as possible by heart at the\nearliest stage, while all who, whatever their age,\ndesire to cultivate the power of memory, should\nendeavour to swallow the initial tedium of reading\nand re-reading what they have written or read, a\nprocess which we may compare to chewing the cud.\nThis task will be rendered less tiresome if we begin\nby confining ourselves to learning only a little at a\ntime, in amounts not sufficient to create disgust: we\n\n\n\nmay then proceed to increase the amount by a line a\nday, an addition which will not sensibly increase the\nlabour of learning, until at last the amount we can\nattack will know no limits.

It is\na curious fact, of which the reason is not obvious, that\nthe interval of a single night will greatly increase\nthe strength of the memory, whether this be due to\nthe fact that it has rested from the labour, the\nfatigue of which constituted the obstacle to success,\nor whether it be that the power of recollection,\nwhich is the most important element of memory,\nundergoes a process of ripening and maturing\nduring the time which intervenes.

Therefore, it matters not which term\nwe employ. But the thing itself has an extraordinarily powerful effect in oratory. For the\nnature of the speech that we have composed within\nour minds is not so important as the manner in\nwhich we produce it, since the emotion of each\nmember of our audience will depend on the impression made upon his hearing. Consequently, no\nproof, at least if it be one devised by the orator\nhimself, will ever be so secure as not to lose its force\n\n\n\nif the speaker fails to produce it in tones that drive\nit home. All emotional appeals will inevitably fall\nflat, unless they are given the fire that voice, look,\nand the whole carriage of the body can give them.\nFor when we have done all this, we may still\naccount ourselves only too fortunate if we have\nsucceeded in communicating the fire of our passion\nto the judge: consequently, we can have no hope\nof moving him if we speak with languor and indifference, nor of preventing him from yielding to the\nnarcotic influence of our own yawns. A proof of this\nis given by actors in the theatre. For they add so\nmuch to the charm even of the greatest poets, that\nthe verse moves us far more when heard than when\nread, while they succeed in securing a hearing even\nfor the most worthless authors, with the result\nthat they repeatedly win a welcome on the\nstage that is denied them in the library. Now\nif delivery can count for so much in themes\nwhich we know to be fictitious and devoid of reality,\nas to arouse our anger, our tears or our anxiety, how\nmuch greater must its effect be when we actually\nbelieve what we hear? For my own part I would\nnot hesitate to assert that a mediocre speech supported by all the power of delivery will be more\nimpressive than the best speech unaccompanied by\nsuch power. It was for this reason that Demosthenes, when asked what was the most important\nthing in oratory, gave the palm to delivery and\nassigned it second and third place as well, until\nhis questioner ceased to trouble him. We are\ntherefore almost justified in concluding that he\nregarded it not merely as the first, but as the only\nvirtue of oratory. This explains why he studied\n\n\n\nunder the instruction of the actor Andronicus with\nsuch diligence and success as thoroughly to justify\nthe remark made by Aeschines to the Rhodians when\nthey expressed their admiration of the speech of\nDemosthenes on behalf of Ctesiphon, \nCicero likewise regards  as the supreme element\nof oratory. He records that Gnaeus Lentulus acquired a greater reputation by his delivery than\nby his actual eloquence, and that Gains Gracchus\nby the same means stirred the whole Roman people\nto tears when he bewailed his brother's death,\nwhile Antonius and Crassus produced a great impression by their command of this quality, though\nthe greatest of all was that produced by Quintus\nHortensius. This statement is strongly supported\nby the fact that the latter's writings fall so far\nshort of the reputation which for so long secured\nhim the first place among orators, then for a\nwhile caused him to be regarded as Cicero's rival,\nand finally, for the remainder of his life assigned\nhim a position second only to that of Cicero, that\nhis speaking must clearly have possessed some\ncharm which we fail to find when we read him.\nAnd, indeed, since words in themselves count for\nmuch and the voice adds a force of its own to the\nmatter of which it speaks, while gesture and motion\nare full of significance, we may be sure of finding\nsomething like perfection when all these qualities\nare combined."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.249"}, "note": {"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Or."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Brut."}], "#text": "III. xi. 42.  lxxiv. 259."}, "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "crescendo"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "fortissimo,"}], "#text": "There are some, however, who consider that delivery which owes nothing to art and everything to\nnatural impulse is more forcible, and in fact the only\nform of delivery which is worthy of a manly speaker.\n\n\n\nBut these persons are as a rule identical, either with\nthose who are in the habit of disapproving of care,\nart, polish and every form of premeditation in actual\nspeaking, as being affected and unnatural, or else\nwith those who (like Lucius Cotta, according to\nCicero) affect the imitation of ancient writers both\nin their choice of words and even in the rudeness of\ntheir intonation and rhythm.

In both cases physical robustness\nis essential to save the voice from dwindling to the\nfeeble shrillness that characterises the voices of\neunuchs, women and invalids, and the means for\ncreating such robustness are to be found in walking,\nrubbing-down with oil, abstinence from sexual intercourse, an easy digestion, and, in a word, in the\nsimple life. Further, the throat must be sound,\nthat is to say, soft and smooth; for if the throat be\nunsound, the voice is broken or dulled or becomes\nharsh or squeaky. For just as the sound produced\nin the pipe by the same volume of breath varies\naccording as the stops are closed or open, or the\ninstrument is clogged or cracked, so the voice is\nstrangled if the throat be swollen, and muffled if it\n\n\n\nis obstructed, while it becomes rasping if the throat\nis inflamed, and may be compared to an organ with\nbroken pipes in cases where the throat is subject to\nspasms. Again, the presence of some obstacle may\ndivide the breath just as a pebble will divide shallow\nwaters, which, although their currents unite again\nsoon after the obstruction is past, still leave a hollow\nspace in rear of the object struck. An excess of\nmoisture also impedes the voice, while a deficiency\nweakens it. As regards fatigue, its effect is the same\nas upon the body: it affects the voice not merely at\nthe moment of speaking, but for some time afterwards. But while exercise, which gives strength in\nall cases, is equally necessary both for orators and\nsinging-masters, it is a different kind of exercise\nwhich they require. For the orator is too much\noccupied by civil affairs to be able to allot fixed\ntimes for taking a walk, and he cannot tune his\nvoice through all the notes of the scale nor spare\nit exertion, since it is frequently necessary for him\nto speak in several cases in succession. Nor is the\nsame regime suitable as regards food: for the orator\nneeds a strong and enduring voice rather than one\nwhich is soft and sweet, while the singer mellows all\nsounds, even the highest, by the modulation of his\nvoice, whereas we have often to speak in harsh and\nagitated tones, must pass wakeful nights, swallow\nthe soot that is produced by the midnight oil and\nstick to our work though our clothes be dripping\nwith sweat. Consequently, we must not attempt to\nmellow our voice by coddling it nor accustom it to\nthe conditions which it would like to enjoy, but\nrather give it exercise suited to the tasks on which\nit will be employed, never allowing it to be impaired\n\n\n\nby silence, but strengthening it by practice, which\nremoves all difficulties. The best method for securing such exercise is to learn passages by heart (for if\nwe have to speak extempore, the passion inspired by\nour theme will distract us from all care for our voice),\nwhile the passages selected for the purpose should\nbe as varied as possible, involving a combination\nof loud, argumentative, colloquial and modulated\nutterance, so that we may prepare ourselves for all\nexigencies simultaneously. This will be sufficient.\nOtherwise your delicate, over trained voice will\nsuccumb before any unusual exertion, like bodies\naccustomed to the oil of the training school, which\nfor all the imposing robustness which they display\nin their own contests, yet, if ordered to make a day's\nmarch with the troops, to carry burdens and mount\nguard at night, would faint beneath the task and\nlong for their trainers to rub them down with oil and\nfor the free perspiration of the naked limbs. Who\nwould tolerate me if in a work such as this I were\nto prescribe avoidance of exposure to sun, wind, rain\nor parching heat? If we are called upon to speak\nin the sun or on a windy, wet or warm day, is that a\nreason for deserting the client whom we have undertaken to defend? While as for the warning given\nby some that the orator should not speak when\ndyspeptic, replete or drunk, or immediately after\nvomiting, I think that no sane person would dream\nof declaiming under such circumstances. There is,\nhowever, good reason for the rule prescribed by all\nauthorities, that the voice should not be overstrained\nin the years of transition between boyhood and manhood, since at that period it is naturally weak, not, I\nthink, on account of heat, as some allege (for there\n\n\n\nis more heat in the body at other periods), but rather\non account of moisture, of which at that age there is\na superabundance. For this reason the nostrils and\nthe breast swell at this stage, and all the organs\ndevelop new growth, with the result that they are\ntender and liable to injury. However, to return to\nthe point, the best and most realistic form of exercise\nfor the voice, once it has become firm and set, is, in\nmy opinion, the practice of speaking daily just as we\nplead in the courts.

The second essential is variety of\ntone, and it is in this alone that delivery really consists. I must warn my readers not to fall into the\nerror of supposing that evenness and variety are incompatible with one another, since the fault opposed\nto evenness is unevenness, while the opposite of\nvariety is that which the Greeks term  or\nuniformity of aspect. The art of producing variety\nnot merely charms and refreshes the ear, but, by the\nvery fact that it involves a change of effort, revives\nthe speaker's flagging energies. It is like the relief\ncaused by changes in position, such as are involved\nby standing, walking, sitting and lying, none of\nwhich can be endured for a long time together.\nBut the most important point (which I shall proceed\nto discuss a little later) is the necessity of adapting\nthe voice to suit the nature of the various subjects\non which we are speaking and the moods that they\ndemand: otherwise our voice will be at variance with\nour language. We must, therefore, avoid that which\nthe Greeks call  that is to say, the unvarying exertion both of lungs and voice. By this I do\nnot simply mean that we must avoid saying everything in a loud tone, a fault which amounts to\nmadness, or in a colloquial tone, which creates an\nimpression of lifelessness, or in a subdued murmur,\nwhich is utterly destructive of all vigour. What I\nmean is this: within the limits of one passage and the\ncompass of one emotion we may vary our tone to a\ncertain, though not a very great extent, according\nas the dignity of the language, the nature of the\nthought, the conclusion and opening of our sentences or transitions from one point to another, may\ndemand. Thus, those who paint in monochrome\n\n\n\nstill represent their objects in different planes, since\notherwise it would have been impossible to depict\neven the limbs of their figures.

We must also beware of confusing our utterance by excessive volubility, which\nresults in disregard of punctuation, loss of emotional\npower, and sometimes in the clipping of words. The\nopposite fault is excessive slowness of speech, which\nis a sign of lack of readiness in invention, tends by\nits sluggishness to render our hearers inattentive,\nand, further, wastes the time allotted to us for speaking, a consideration which is of some importance.\nOur speech must be ready, but not precipitate, under\ncontrol, but not slow, while we must not take breath\nso often as to break up our sentence, nor, on the\nother hand, sustain it until it fails us from exhaustion.\nFor the sound produced by loss of breath is disagreeable; we gasp like a drowning man and fill our lungs\nwith long drawn inhalations at in appropriate moments,\ngiving the impression that our action is due not to\nchoice, but to compulsion. Therefore, in attacking\na period of abnormal length, we should collect our\nbreath, but quickly, noiselessly and imperceptibly.\nOn other occasions we shall be able to take breath\nat the natural breaks in the substance of our speech.\nBut we must exercise our breathing capacity to make\nit as great as possible. To produce this result Demosthenes used to recite as many successive lines as\n\n\n\npossible, while he was climbing a hill. He also, with\na view to securing fluency free from impediment,\nused to roll pebbles under his tongue when speaking\nin the privacy of his study. Sometimes the breath,\nalthough capable of sustained effort and sufficiently\nfull and clear, lacks firmness when exerted, had for\nthat reason is liable to become tremulous, like bodies\nwhich, although to all appearances sound, receive\ninsufficient support from the sinews. This the Greeks\ncall  There are some too who, owing to\nthe loss of teeth, do not draw in the breath naturally,\nbut suck it in with a hissing sound. There are\nothers who pant incessantly and so loudly that it\nis perfectly audible within them: they remind one\nof heavily-laden beasts of burden straining against\nthe yoke. Some indeed actually affect this mannerism, as though to suggest that they are struggling\nwith the host of ideas that crowd themselves upon\nthem and oppressed by a greater flood of eloquence\nthan their throats are capable of uttering. Others,\nagain, find a difficulty in opening their mouths, and\nseem to struggle with their words; and, further,\nalthough they are not actually faults of the voice,\nyet since they arise out of the use of the voice,\nI think this is the most appropriate place for\nreferring to the habit of coughing and spitting with\nfrequency while speaking, of hawking up phlegm\nfrom the depths of the lungs, like water from a\nwell, sprinkling the nearest of the bystanders with\nsaliva, and expelling the greater portion of the\nbreath through the nostrils. But any of these faults\nare tolerable compared with the practice of chanting\ninstead of speaking, which is the worst feature of\nour modern oratory, whether in the courts or in the\n\n\n\nschools, and of which I can only say that I do not\nknow whether it is more useless or more repugnant\nto good taste. For what can be less becoming to\nan orator than modulations that recall the stage and\na sing-song utterance which at times resembles the\nmaudlin utterance of drunken revellers? What can\nbe more fatal to any emotional appeal than that the\nspeaker should, when the situation calls for grief,\nanger, indignation or pity, not merely avoid the\nexpression of those emotions which require to be\nkindled in the judge, but outrage the dignity of\nthe courts with noises such as are dear to the\nLycians and Carians? For Cicero has told us that\nthe rhetoricians of Lycia and Caria come near to\nsinging in their perorations. But, as a matter of tact,\nwe have somewhat overstepped the limits imposed by\nthe more restrained style of singing. I ask you,\ndoes anyone sing, I will not say when his theme is\nmurder, sacrilege or parricide, but at any rate when\nhe deals with figures or accounts, or, to cut a long\nstory short, when he is pleading in any kind of\nlawsuit whatever? And if such a form of intonation\nis to be permitted at all, there is really no reason\nwhy the modulations of the voice should not be\naccompanied by harps and flutes, or even by cymbals,\nwhich would be more appropriate to the revolting\nexhibitions of which I am speaking. And yet we\nshow no reluctance in indulging this vicious practice.\nFor no one thinks his own singing hideous, and it\ninvolves less trouble than genuine pleading. There\nare, moreover, some persons who, in thorough conformity with their other vices, are possessed with a\nperpetual passion for hearing something that will\nsoothe their ears. But, it may be urged, does not\n\n\n\nCicero himself say that there is a suggestion of\nsinging in the utterance of an orator? And is not\nthis the outcome of a natural impulse?

The former breaks out naturally, as in\nthe case of grief, anger or indignation, but lacks\nart, and therefore requires to be formed by methodical\ntraining. The latter, on the other hand, does imply\nart, but lacks the sincerity of nature: consequently\nin such cases the main thing is to excite the appropriate feeling in oneself, to form a mental picture\nof the facts, and to exhibit an emotion that cannot\nbe distinguished from the truth.

For it is by this that we express supplication, threats, flattery, sorrow, joy, pride or submission. It is on this that our audience hang, on\nthis that they rivet their attention and their gaze,\neven before we begin to speak. It is this that\ninspires the hearer with affection or dislike, this\nthat conveys a world of meaning and is often more\neloquent than all our words. Consequently in plays\ndestined for the stage, the masters of the art of\ndelivery design even their masks to enhance the\nemotional effect. Thus, in tragedy, Aerope will be\n\n\n\nsad, Medea fierce, Ajax bewildered, Hercules truculent. In comedy, on the other hand, over and\nabove the methods adopted to distinguish between\nslaves, pimps, parasites, rustics, soldiers, harlots,\nmaidservants, old men stern and mild, youths moral\nor luxurious, married women and girls, we have\nthe important rle of the father who, because at\ntimes he is excited and at others call, has one\neyebrow raised and the other normal, the custom\namong actors being to turn that side of the face to\nthe audience which best suits the role. But of the\nvarious elements that go to form the expression,\nthe eyes are the most important, since they, more\nthan any-thing else, reveal the temper of the mind,\nand without actual movement will twinkle with\nmerriment or be clouded with grief. And further,\nnature has given them tears to serve as interpreters\nof our feelings, tears that will break forth for sorrow\nor stream for very joy. But, when the eyes move,\nthey become intent, indifferent, proud, fierce, mild,\nor angry; and they will assume all these characters\naccording as the pleading may demand. But they\nmust never he fixed or protruding, languid or sluggish, lifeless, lascivious, restless, nor swim with a\nmoist voluptuous glance, nor look aslant nor leer\nin amorous fashion, nor yet must they seem to\npromise or ask a boon. As for keeping them fully\nor partially closed while speaking, surely none save\nan uneducated man or a fool would dream of doing\nsuch a thing. And in addition to all these forms of\nexpression, the upper and lower eyelids can render\nservice in support of the eyes. The eyebrows also\nmay be used with great effect. For to some extent\nthey mould the expression of the eyes and\n\n\n\ndetermine that of the forehead. It is by means of the\neyebrows that we contract, raise or smooth the\nlatter: in fact, the only thing which has greater\ninfluence over it is the blood, which moves in conformity with the emotions that control the mind,\ncausing a blush on a skin that is sensitive to shame,\nand giving place to an icy pallor under the influence\nof fear, whereas, when it is under control, it produces a peaceful complexion, intermediate between\nthe two. Complete immobility in the eyebrows is\na fault, as also is excess of mobility or the tendency\nto raise one and lower the other, as in the comic\nmask which I mentioned just now: while it is a\nfurther blemish if they express a feeling out of\nkeeping with the words we utter. For they show\nanger by contraction, grief by depression and cheerfulness by their expansion. They are also dropped\nor raised to express consent or refusal respectively.\nIt is not often that the lips or nostrils can be\nbecomingly employed to express our feelings, although they are often used to indicate derision,\ncontempt or loathing. For to \n(as Horace says), or blow them out, or twitch them,\nor fret them with our finger, or snort through them\nwith a sudden expulsion of the breath, or stretch\nthem wide or push them up with the flat of the\nhand are all indecorous, since it is not without reason\nthat censure is passed even on blowing the nose too\nfrequently. It is also an ugly habit to protrude the\nlips, open them with a sudden smack, compress\nthem, draw them apart and bare the teeth, or twist\nthem awry to one side till they almost reach the\near, or to curl them in scorn, or let them droop, or\nallow the voice to escape only on one side.

But this is a type of gesture\nwhich should be rigorously avoided in pleading.

It is also useful in the\n but in that case the hand must be\nmoved with firmness and a little further forward,\nwhile, if we are reproaching or refuting our adversary, the same movement may be employed with\nsome vehemence and energy, since such passages\npermit of greater freedom of extension. On the\nother hand, this same gesture is often directed sideways towards the left shoulder: this is a mistake,\nalthough it is a still worse fault to thrust the arm\nacross the chest and gesticulate with the elbow.\nThe middle and third fingers are also sometimes\nturned under the thumb, producing a still more\nforcible effect than the gesture previously described,\nbut not well adapted for use in the  or \n\n\n\n But when three fingers are doubled\nunder the thumb, the finger, which Cicero says\nthat Crassus used to such effect, is extended. It is\nused in denunciation and in indication (whence its\nname of index finger), while if it be slightly dropped\nafter the hand has been raised toward the shoulder,\nit signifies affirmation, and if pointed as it were\nface downwards toward the ground, it expresses\ninsistence. It is sometimes also used to indicate\nnumber. Again, if its top joint is lightly gripped on\neither side, with the two outer fingers slightly\ncurved, the little finger rather less than the third,\nwe shall have a gesture well suited for argument.\nBut for this purpose the same gesture is rendered\nmore emphatic by holding the middle joint of the\nfinger and contracting the last two fingers still\nfurther to match the lower position of the middle\nfinger and thumb. The following gesture is admirably adapted to accompany modest language: the\nthumb and the next three fingers are gently converged to a point and the hand is carried to the\nneighbourhood of the month or chest, then relaxed\npalm downwards and slightly advanced. It was\nwith this gesture that I believe Demosthenes to\nhave commenced the timid and subdued exordium\nof his speech in defence of Ctesiphon, and it was,\nI think, in such a position that Cicero held his\nland, when he said,  Slightly greater\nfreedom may be given to the gesture by pointing\nthe fingers down and drawing the hand in towards\nthe body and then opening it somewhat more rapidly\nin the opposite direction, so that it seems as though\nit were delivering our words to the audience.\n\n\n\nSometimes we may hold the first two fingers apart without,\nhowever, inserting the thumb between them, the\nremaining two pointing inwards, while even the two\nformer must not be fully extended. Sometimes,\nagain, the third and little finger may be pressed in to\nthe palm near the base of the thumb, which in its\nturn is pressed against the middle joints of the first\nand middle fingers; at others the little finger is\nsometimes drooped obliquely, or the four fingers may\nbe relaxed rather than extended and the thumb\nslanted inwards: this last gesture is well adapted to\npointing to one side or marking the different points\nwhich we are making, the had being carried palmupwards to the left and swept back to the right\nface-downwards. The following short gestures are\nalso employed: the hand may be slightly hollowed\nas it is when persons are making a vow, and then\nmoved slightly to and fro, the shoulders swaying\ngently in unison: this is adapted to passages where\nwe speak with restraint and almost with timidity.\nWonder is best expressed as follows: the hand turns\nslightly upwards and the fingers are brought in to\nthe palm, one after the other, beginning with the\nlittle finger; the hand is then opened and turned\nround by a reversal of this motion. There are various\nmethods of expressing interrogation; but, as a rule,\nwe do so by a turn of the hand, the arrangement of\nthe fingers being indifferent. If the first finger\ntouch the middle of the right-hand edge of the\nthumb-nail with its extremity, the other fingers\nbeing relaxed, we shall have a graceful gesture well\nsuited to express approval or to accompany  and to mark the distinction between our\ndifferent points. There is another gesture not unlike\n\n\n\nthe preceding, in which the remaining three fingers\nare folded: it is much employed by the Greeks both\nfor the left hand and the right, in rounding off their\n detail by detail. A gentle movement of\nthe hand expresses promise or assent, a more violent\nmovement suggests exhortation or sometimes praise.\nThere is also that familiar gesture by which we drive\nhome our words, consisting in the rapid opening\nand shutting of the hand: but this is a common\nrather than an artistic gesture. Again, there is the\nsomewhat unusual gesture in which the hand is\nhollowed and raised well above the shoulder with a\nmotion suggestive of exhortation. The tremulous\nmotion now generally adopted by foreign schools is,\nhowever, fit only for the stage. I do not know why\nsome persons disapprove of the movement of the\nfingers, with their tops converging, towards the\nmouth. For we do this when we are slightly surprised, and at times also employ it to express fear or\nentreaty when we are seized with sudden indignation.\nFurther, we sometimes clench the hand and press\nit to our breast when we are expressing regret or\nanger, an occasion when it is not unbecoming even\nto force the voice through the teeth in phrases such\nas  \nTo point at something with the thumb turned back\nis a gesture which is in general just, but is not, in my\nopinion, becoming to an orator. Motion is generally\ndivided into six kinds, but circular motion must be\nregarded as a seventh. The latter alone is faulty\nwhen applied to gesture. The remaining motions\nthat is, forward, to right or left and up or downall\nhave their significance, but the gesture is never\ndirected to what lies behind us, though we do at\n\n\n\ntimes throw the hand back. The best effect is produced by letting the motion of the hand start from\nthe left and end on the right, but this must be done\ngently, the hand sinking to rest and avoiding all\nappearance of giving a blow, although at the end of\na sentence it may sometimes be allowed to drop, but\nmust quickly be raised again: or it may occasionally,\nwhen we desire to express wonder or dissent, spring\nback with a rapid motion."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "107"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "108"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "109"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "110"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "111"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "112"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "113"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "114"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "115"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "116"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "novum crimen,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Giai Caesar,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "et ante diem,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "non auditum,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "propinquus meus,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ad te"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Quintus Tubero"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "detulit."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "novum crimes, Gai Caesar,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "et ante hanc diem\nnon auditum,"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Lig."}, "quote": "It is a new charge, Gaius Caesar, a\nchartgo hitherto, unheard of, that my kinsman, Quintus Tubero,\nhas brought to your notice.", "#text": "i. 1."}, "The general sense is clear, though the text is unsetsfactory and scarcely translatable.", {"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Cic."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Or."}], "#text": "See   III. lvi. 214."}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.303"}, {"@id": "p.305"}], "quote": [{"note": {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Mil."}, "#text": "xxxi. 85."}, "#text": "Ye hills and groves of Alba,"}, "Whither, alas!\nshall I turn me?

Otherwise the gesture will anticipate or\nlag behind the voice, both of which produce an\nunpleasing effect. Some, through excess of subtlety,\nhave erroneously prescribed that there should be an\ninterval of three words between each movement;\nbut this rule is never observed, nor can it be. These\npersons, however, were desirous that there should be\nsome standard of speed or slowness (a most rational\ndesire), with a view to avoid prolonged inactivity on\nthe part of the hands as well as the opposite fault,\ninto which so many fall, of breaking up the natural\nflow of their delivery by continual motion. There is\nanother still more common error, which is less easy\nof detection. Language possesses certain imperceptible stresses, indeed we might almost call them\nfeet, to which the gesture of most speakers conforms.\nThus there will he one movement at \nanother at  a third at \na fourth at  a fifth at  a\nsixth at  and others at  and\n From this springs a further error, namely,\nthat young men, when writing out their speeches,\n\n\n\ndevise all their gestures in advance and consider as\nthey compose how the hand is to fall at each\nparticular point. A further unfortunate result is\nthat the movement of the hand, which should end\non the right, frequently finishes on the left. It is\ntherefore better, in view of the fact that all speech\nfalls into a number of brief clauses, at the end of\nwhich we can take breath, if necessary, to arrange\nour gesture to suit these sections. For example, the\nwords  in a sense form a\nphrase complete in itself, since they are followed by\na conjunction, while the next words,  are also sufficiently self-contained. To\nthese phrases the motions of the hand must be conformed, before the speech has passed beyond the\ncalmness of tone on which it opens. But when increasing warmth of feeling has fired the orator, the\ngesture will become more frequent, in keeping with\nthe impetus of the speech. Some places are best\nsuited by a rapid, and others by a restrained delivery.\nIn the one case we pass rapidly on, fire a volley of\narguments and hurry upon our way; in the other, we\ndrive home our points, force them on the hearer and\nimplant them in his mind. But the slower the\ndelivery, the greater its emotional power: thus,\nRosins was rapid and ESOPs weighty in his delivery,\nbecause the former was a comic and the latter a\ntragic actor. The same rule applies to the movemints. Consequently on the stage young men and\nold, soldiers and married women all walk sedately,\nwhile slaves, maidservants, parasites and fishermen\nare more lively in their movements. But instructors\nin the art of gesture will not permit the hand to be\nraised above the level of the eyes or lowered beneath\n\n\n\nthat of the breast; since it is thought a grave blemish\nto lift it to the top of the head or lower it to the lower\nportions of the belly. It may be moved to the left\nwithin the limits of the shoulder, but no further\nwithout loss of decorum. On the other hand, when,\nto express our aversion, we thrust our hand out to\nthe left, the left shoulder must be brought forward\nin unison with the head, which will incline to the\nright. It is never correct to employ the left hand\nalone in gesture, though it will often conform its\nmotion to that of the right, as, for example, when\nwe are counting our arguments on the fingers, or\nturn the palms of the hands to the left to express\nour horror of something, or thrust them out in front\nor spread them out to right and left, or lower them in\napology or supplication (though the gesture is not\nthe same in these two cases), or raise them in adoration, or stretch them out in demonstration or invocation, as in the passage, \nor in the passage from Gracchus:  etc. For\nin such passages greater emotional effect is produced if both hands co-operate, short gestures being\nbest adapted to matters of small importance and\nthemes of a gentle or melancholy character, and\nlonger gestures to subjects of importance or themes\ncalling for joy or horror."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "117"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "118"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "119"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "120"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "121"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "122"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "123"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "124"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "125"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "126"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "127"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "128"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "129"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "131"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "132"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "133"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "134"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "135"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "136"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Le."}, "#text": "crooking the thumb against the forefinger to\nrepresent the symbol D."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "I.e."}, "#text": "with exaggerated violence.

This last proceeding may at times be adopted by itself; but they\nconvert it into a blemish by simultaneously raising\none or even two fingers as high as they can reach, or\nheaving up both hands as if they were carrying something. In addition to these faults, there are those\nwhich spring not from nature, but from nervousness,\nsuch as struggling desperately with our lips when\nthey refuse to open, making inarticulate sounds, as\n\n\n\nthough something were sticking in our throat, when\nour memory fails us, or our thoughts will not come\nat our call; rubbing the end of our nose, walking up\nand down in the midst of an unfinished sentence,\nstopping suddenly and courting applause by silence,\nwith many other tricks which it would take too long\nto detail, since everybody has his own particular\nfaults. We must take care not to protrude the chest\nor stomach, since such an altitude arches the back,\nand all bending backwards is unsightly. The flanks\nmust conform to the gesture; for the motion of the\nentire body contributes to the effect: indeed, Cicero\nholds that the body is more expressive than even the\nhands. For in the  he says,  Slapping the\nthigh, which Clean is said to have been the first to\nintroduce at Athens, is in general use and is becoming\nas a mark of indignation, while it also excites the\naudience. Cicero regrets its absence in Calidius,\n he complains,  With regard to the\nforehead I must beg leave to differ from him: for it\nis a purely theatrical trick even to clap the hands or\nbeat the breast. it is only on rare occasions, too,\nthat it is becoming to touch the breast with the\nfinger-tips of the hollowed hand, when, for example,\nwe address ourselves or speak words of exhortation,\nreproach or commiseration. But if ever we do employ\nthis gesture, it will not be unbecoming to pull back\nthe toga at the same time. As regards the feet, we\nneed to be careful about our gait and the attitudes\n\n\n\nin which we stand. To stand with the right foot\nadvanced or to thrust forward the same foot and\nhand are alike unsightly. At times we may rest our\nweight on the right foot, but without any corresponding inclination of the chest, while, in any case,\nthe gesture is better suited to the comic actor than to\nthe orator. It is also a mistake, when resting on the\nleft foot, to lift the right or poise it on tiptoe. To\nstraddle the feet is ugly if we are standing still, and\nalmost indecent if we are actually moving. To start\nforward may be effective, provided that we move but\na short distance and do so but rarely and without\nviolence. It will also at times be found convenient\nto walk to and fro, owing to the extravagant pauses\nimposed by the plaudits of the audience; Cicero,\nhowever, says that this should be done only on rare\noccasions, and that we should take not more than a\nfew steps. On the other hand, to run up and down,\nwhich, in the ease of Manlius Sure, Domitius Afer\ncalled overdoing it, is sheer folly, and there was no\nlittle wit in the question put by Virginias Flatus to\na rival professor, when he asked how many miles he\nhad declaimed. I know, too, that some authorities\nwarn us not to walk with our backs turned to the\njudges, but to move diagonally and keep our eyes\nfixed on the panel. This cannot be done in private\ntrials, but in such cases the space available is small\nand the time during which our backs are turned is of\nthe briefest. On the other hand, we are permitted\nat times to walk backwards gradually. Some even\njump backwards, which is merely ludicrous. Stamping the foot is, as Cicero says, effective when done\non suitable occasions, that is to say, at the commence\nmeant or close of a lively argument, but if it be\n\n\n\nfrequently indulged in, it brands the speaker as a\nfool and ceases to attract the attention of the judge.\nThere is also the unsightly habit of swaying to right\nand left, and shifting the weight from one foot to\nthe other. Above all, we must avoid effeminate\nmovements, such as Cicero ascribes to Titus, a circumstance which led to a certain kind of dance being\nnicknamed Titus. Another reprehensible practice\nis that of nodding frequently and rapidly to either\nside, a mannerism for which the elder Curio was derided by Julius, who asked who it was who was speaking in a boat, while on another occasion, when Curio\nhad been tossing himself about in his usual manner,\nwhile Octaves, his colleague, was sitting beside him\nbandaged and reeking with medicaments on account\nof ill-health, Spiciness remarked,  The shoulders also\nare apt to be jerked to and fro, a fault of which\nDemosthenes is said to have cured himself by\nspeaking on a narrow platform with a spear hanging\nimmediately above his shoulder, in order that, if in\nthe heat of his eloquence he failed to avoid this\nfault, he might have his attention called to the\nfact by a prick from the spear. The only condition\nthat justifies our walking about while speaking is\nif we are pleading in a public trial before a large\nnumber of judges and desire specially to impress our\narguments upon them individually. The practice\nadopted by some of throwing the toga back over the\nshoulder, while they draw up the fold to their waist\nwith the right hand, and use the left for gesticulation\nas they walk up and down and discourse, is not to\n\n\n\nbe tolerated; for even to draw back the left hand\nwhile extending the right is an objectionable habit.\nThis reminds me of an extremely foolish trick, which\nI think I ought to mention, that some speakers have\nof employing the intervals when the audience are\napplauding by whispering in someone's ear or jesting\nwith their friends or looking back at their clerks, as\nif telling them to make a note of some gratuity to\nbe dispensed to their supporters. On the other\nhand, when we are making some explanation to the\njudge, more especially if the point be somewhat\nobscure, a slight inclination in his direction will be\nnot unbecoming. But to lean forward towards the\nadvocate seated on the benches of our opponent is\noffensive, while, unless we are genuinely fatigued, it\nis a piece of affectation to lean back among our own\nfriends and to be supported in their arms; the same\nremark also applies to the practice of being prompted\naloud or reading from manuscript as though uncertain of our memory. For all these mannerisms impair the force of our speaking, chill the\neffect of emotional appeals and make the judge\nthink that he is not being treated with sufficient\nrespect. To cross over to the seats of our opponents\nborders on impudence, and Cassius Severus showed\na neat turn of wit when he demanded that a barrier\nmight be erected between himself and an opponent\nwho behaved in this fashion. Moreover, though to\nadvance towards our opponent may at times produce\nan impression of passionate energy, the return to\nour former position will always prove correspondingly\ntame. Many of the rules which I have given will\nrequire modification by those who have to plead\nbefore judges seated on a dais. For in such\n\n\n\ncases the face must be raised somewhat higher, so\nthat the speaker's eyes may be fixed on the president\nof the court: for the same reason his gestures must\nalso be carried a little higher, while there are other\ndetails which will readily occur to my reader without\nany mention from me. Similar modifications will\nbe likewise necessary for those who plead sitting.\nFor this is done, as a rule, only in cases of minor\nimportance, where delivery will necessarily be more\nrestrained, and certain defects are inevitable. For\nexample, when the speaker sits on the left side of the\njudge, he will have to advance his right foot, while\nif he be seated on the right, many of his gestures\nmust be made from right to left, in order that they\nmay be addressed to the judge. Personally, I note\nthat many speakers start up at the conclusion of\nindividual periods, while some proceed to walk to\nand fro for a little: it is for them to decide whether\nthis is becoming or not: I will merely remark that,\nwhen they do this, they are not pleading seated.\nIt was a common custom, which has not entirely\ndisappeared, to drink or even to eat while pleading;\nbut I shall not permit my ideal orator to do anything\nof the kind. For if a man cannot endure the\nburdens imposed by oratory without having recourse\nto such remedies, he should not find it a serious\nhardship to give up pleading altogether, a course\nwhich is far preferable to acknowledging his contempt\nboth for his profession and his audience."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "137"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "138"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "139"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "140"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "141"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "142"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "143"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "144"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.319"}, {"@id": "p.321"}, {"@id": "p.323"}], "note": [{"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "balleus,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "sinus."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "balleus."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "umbo,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pars quae\nultima imponitur."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "balteus,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Companion to Latin Studies,"}], "milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, "#text": "In putting on the toga, it was thrown first over the left\nshoulder, so that about 6 feet hung in front and about 12\nbehind.

It\nshould, therefore, be distinguished and manly, as,\nindeed, it ought to be with all men of position. For\n\n\n\nexcessive care with regard to the cut of the toga,\nthe style of the shoes, or the arrangement of the\nhair, is just as reprehensible as excessive carelessness. There are also details of dress which are\naltered to some extent by successive changes in\nfashion. The ancients, for example, wore no folds,\nand their successors wore them very short. Consequently it follows that in view of the fact that their\narms were, like those of the Greeks, covered by the\ngarment, they must have employed a different form of\ngesture in the exordium from that which is now in\nuse. However, I am speaking of our own day. The\nspeaker who has not the right to wear the broad\nstripe, will wear his girdle in such a way that the\nfront edges of the tunic fall a little below his knees,\nwhile the edges in rear reach to the middle of his\nhams. For only women draw them lower and only\ncenturions higher. If we wear the purple stripe, it\nrequires but little care to see that it fills becomingly;\nnegligence in this respect sometimes excites criticism. Among those who wear the broad stripe, it is\nthe fashion to let it hang somewhat lower than in\ngarments that are retained by the girdle. The toga\nitself should, in my opinion, be round, and cut to\nfit, otherwise there are a number of ways in which it\nmay be unshapely. Its front edge should by preference reach to the middle of the shin, while tie back\nshould be higher in proposition as the girdle is higher\n\n\n\nbehind than in front. The fold is most becoming,\nif it fall to a point a little above the lower edge of\nthe tunic, and should certainly never fall below it.\nThe other fold which passes obliquely like a belt\nunder the right shoulder and over the left, should\nneither be too tight nor too loose. The portion of\nthe toga which is last to be arranged should fall\nrather low, since it will sit better thus and be\nkept in its place. A portion of the tunic also should\nbe drawn back in order that it may not fall over the\narm when we are pleading, and the fold should be\nthrown over the shoulder, while it will not be\nunbecoming if the edge be turned back. On the\nother hand, we should not cover the shoulder and\nthe whole of the throat, otherwise our dress will be\nunduly narrowed and will lose the impressive effect\nproduced by breadth at the chest. Tire left arm\nshould only be raised so far as to form a right angle\nat the elbow, while the edge of the toga should fall\nin equal lengths on either side. The hand should\nnot be overloaded with rings, which should under no\ncircumstances encroach upon the middle joint of\nthe finger. The most becoming attitude for the\nhand is produced by raising the thumb and slightly\ncurving the fingers, unless it is occupied with holding manuscript. But we should not go out of our\nway to carry the latter, for it suggests an acknowledgement that we do not trust our memory, and is\na hindrance to a number of gestures. The ancients\nused to let the toga fall to the heels, as the Greeks\nare in the habit of doing with the cloak: Plotius\nand Nigidius both recommend this in the books\nwhich they wrote about gesture as practised in\ntheir own day. I am consequently all the more\n\n\n\nsurprised at the view expressed by so learned a\nman as Plinius Secundus, especially since it occurs\nin a book which carries minute research almost to\nexcess: for he asserts that Cicero was in the\nhabit of wearing his toga in such a fashion to conceal his varicose veins, despite the fact that this\nfashion is to be seen in the statues of persons who\nlived after Cicero's day. As regards the short cloak,\nbandages used to protect the legs, mufflers and\ncoverings for the ears, nothing short of ill-health\ncan excuse their use."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "statement of facts,"}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "145"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "146"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "147"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "148"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "149"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.325"}, "#text": "But such attention to our dress is only possible at\nthe beginning of a speech, since, as the pleading\ndevelops, in fact, almost from the beginning of the\n the fold will slip down from the\nshoulder quite naturally and as it were of its own\naccord, while when we come to arguments and\ncommonplaces, it will be found convenient to throw\nback the toga from the left shoulder, and even to\nthrow down the fold if it should stick. The left\nhand may be employed to pluck the toga from the\nthroat and the upper portion of the chest, for by\nnow the whole body will be hot. And just as at\nthis point the voice becomes more vehement and\nmore varied in its utterance, so the clothing begins\nto assume something of a combative pose. Consequently, although to wrap the toga round the left\nhand or to pull it about us as a girdle would be\nalmost a symptom of madness, while to throw back\nthe fold from its bottom over the right shoulder\nwould be a foppish and effeminate gesture, and\nthere are yet worse effects than these, there is, at\nany rate, no reason why we should not place the\nlooser portions of the fold under the left arm, since\n\n\n\nit gives an air of vigour and freedom not ill-suited\nto the warmth and energy of our action.

But there are a number of further\nconsiderations which the orator must bear in mind.\nIn the first place there is the question as to the\ncharacter of speaker, judges and audience. For\njust as the methods of speaking may justifiably be\nvaried to suit the characteristics of different orators\nand different judges, so it is with delivery. The\nsame characteristics of voice, gesture and gait are\nnot equally becoming in the presence of the\nemperor, the senate, the people, and magistrates,\nor in private and public trials, or in making a\n\n\n\nrequest to the praetor for the appointment of a judge\nto hear our case, and in actual pleading. Anyone\nwho will reflect upon the matter will realise the\nnature of the differences involved, as he will also be\nable to realise the nature of the subject on which\nhe is speaking and the effect which he desires to\nproduce. The considerations with regard to the\nsubject are four in number, of which the first has\nreference to the case as a whole. For the case may\nbe of a gloomy or a cheerful nature, an anxious\nbusiness, or one that calls for no alarm, and may\ninvolve issues of great or trivial importance. We\nought, therefore, never to be so preoccupied over\nparticular portions of a case as to forget to consider\nthe case as a whole. The second point is concerned\nwith the different aspects of the various portions of\nthe speech, that is, the  and  The third concerns the\nthoughts, which will vary according to the subject\nmatter and the emotions which we require to\nawaken. The fourth has reference to the words,\nwhich must be given appropriate expression, unless\ntheir force is to be entirely wasted, although it is an\nerror to attempt to make our delivery reproduce the\nsense of every single word. Consequently, in panegyric, funeral orations excepted, in returning thanks,\nexhortations and the like, the delivery must be\nluxuriant, magnificent, and grand. On the other\nhand, in funeral or consolatory speeches, together\nwith most of those in defence of accused persons,\nthe delivery will be melancholy and subdued.\nWhen we speak in the senate, it will be authoritative, when we address the people, dignified, and\nwhen we are pleading in private cases, restrained.\n\n\n\nAs regards the respective portions of speeches,\nthoughts and words, I must speak at somewhat\ngreater length, as the problems involved are manifold."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "154"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "155"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "156"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "157"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "158"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "159"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "160"}], "quote": ["Would those statements,", "have been delivered by you in such a\nmanner if they had been true?", "You\nwere far from kindling our emotions.

A persuasive effect, on\nthe other hand, is produced by the power of assertion,\nwhich is sometimes more convincing even than actual\nproof.  says Cicero to\nCalidius,  And again,  We must therefore reveal both\nconfidence and firmness, above all, if we have the\nrequisite authority to back them. The method of\narousing the emotions depends on our power to\nrepresent or imitate the passions. Therefore when\nthe judge in private, or the usher in public cases,\ncalls upon us to speak, we must rise with deliberation.\nWe shall then, to make our garb the more becoming,\nand to secure a moment for reflexion, devote a brief\nspace to the arrangement of our toga or even, if\nnecessary, to throwing it on afresh; but it must\nbe borne in mind that this injunction applies only\nto cases in the courts; for  must not do this if\nwe are speaking before the emperor or a magistrate,\nor in cases where the judge sits in a position of\nsuperior authority. Even when we turn to the judge,\n\n\n\nand have requested and received the praetor's permission to address the court, we must not break forth\nat once into speech, but should allow ourselves a few\nmoments for reflexion. For the display of such care\non the part of one who is about to speak attracts the\naudience and gives the judge time to settle down.\nHomer inculcates this practice by placing before\nus the example of Ulysses, whom he describes as\nhaving stood for a while with eyes fixed on the\nground and staff held motionless, before he poured\nforth his whirlwind of eloquence. In this preliminary\ndelay there are certain pauses, as the actors call\nthem, which are not unbecoming. We may stroke\nour head, look at our hand, wring the fingers, pretend to summon all our energies for the effort,\nconfess to nervousness by a deep sigh, or may adopt\nany other method suited to our individual character,\nwhile these proceedings may be extended over some\ntime, if we find that the judge is not yet giving us\nhis attention. Our attitude should be upright, our\nfeet level and a slight distance apart, or the left may\nbe very slightly advanced. The knees should be\nupright, but not stiff; the shoulders relaxed, the face\nstern, but not sad, expressionless or languid: the\narms should be held slightly away from the side,\nthe left hand being in the position described above,\nwhile the right, at the moment when our speech\nbegins, should be slightly extended beyond the fold\nof the toga with the most modest of gestures, as\nthough waiting for the commencement. For it is\na mistake to look at the ceiling, to rub the face and\ngive it a flush of impudence, to crane it boldly forward, to frown in order to secure a fierce expression,\nor brush back the hair from the forehead against its\n\n\n\nnatural direction in order to produce a terrifying\neffect by making it stand on end. Again, there are\nother unseemly tricks, such as that so dear to the\nGreeks of twitching our fingers and lips as though\nstudying what to say, clearing the throat with a\nloud noise, thrusting out one foot to a considerable\ndistance, grasping a portion of the toga in the left\nhand, standing with feet wide apart, holding ourselves\nstiffly, leaning backwards, stooping, or bunching our\nshoulders toward the back of the head, as wrestlers\ndo when about to engage."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "161"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "162"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "163"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "164"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "165"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "166"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "167"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "168"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "169"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "exordium."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "exordia"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "statement of facts"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "proofs,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Argument,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Digressions,"}], "note": ["IV. i. 40.", {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "i."}, "#text": "pro Lig. 2."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Cluenet."}, "#text": "v. 11."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Cluent. v."}, "#text": "14."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Verr."}, "#text": "xxx. 76"}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cp."}, "#text": "IV. iii. 13."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "cp."}, "#text": "IV. iii. 13."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Cornelio: cp."}, "#text": "In the lost  IV. iii. 13."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Galio."}, "#text": "From the lost"}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Liq."}, "#text": "iii. 7 and 6."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Liq."}, "#text": "iii. 9."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Phil."}, "#text": "ii. xxv. 63."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Mil."}, "#text": "xxxi. 85."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Arch."}, "#text": "viii. 19."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Cor. 90."}}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "In Ctes."}, "#text": "72."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "De Cor."}, "#text": "60."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "In Ctes."}, "#text": "49."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Rab. perd."}, "#text": "vi. 18."}], "quote": ["For Quintus\nLigarius, since there was no hint of the likelihood of\nthe war in Africa,", "Aulus Cluentius Habitus,\nthis man's father.", "The mother-in-law\nweds her son-in-law,", "There in the market-place of Laodicea was displayed a grievous and afflicting spectacle for all the\nprovince of Asia to behold.", "I seemed to see some\npersons entering the room and others leaving it,\nwhile others were staggering to and fro under the\ninfluence of wine.", "When the war was begun, Caesar,\nand was, in fact, well on its way to a conclusion.", "I will use my voice to its\nfullest power, that all the Roman people may hear\nme.", "What was that sword of yours doing,\n'Tubero, that sword that was drawn on the field of\nPharsalus?", "But in an assembly of the Homan people,\nand when he was performing his official functions.", "You, hills and groves of\nAlba", "Rocks and solitudes answer\nto the voice.", "Why\ndo you not restrain those cries, the proof of your\nfolly and the evidence of your small numbers?", "Why do\nyou not restrain?"], "pb": [{"@id": "p.335"}, {"@id": "p.337"}, {"@id": "p.339"}], "#text": "A gentle delivery is most often best suited to the\n For there is nothing better calculated\nthan modesty to win the good-will of the judge,\nalthough there are exceptions to the rule, since, as I\nhave already pointed out, all  are not delivered\nin the same manner.

There\nare a number of gradations of tone which may be\n\n\n\nemployed to kindle the feeling of the judges. The\nmost vehement tones that an orator is ever called\nupon to use will be employed in passages such as\nthe following: \nFor he has just said:  On the other hand, a lower tone, not devoid\nof a certain charm, should be employed in passages\nsuch as:  But the utterance must be fuller,\nslower, and consequently sweeter, when the orator\nsays, \nIn this passage every sound should e drawn out,\nwe should dwell upon the vowel-sounds and speak\nfill-throated. Still fuller should be the stream of our\nvoice in the invocation, ; while a tone not far removed from chanting,\nand dying away to a cadence, should be employed in\ndelivering the phrase,  These are the modulations denounced\nby Demosthenes and Aeschines, but they do not\nnecessarily for that reason merit our disapprobation.\nFor as each of these orators taunts the other with\nmaking use of them, it is clear that they were employed\nby both. We may be sure that Demosthenes did not\nrestrict himself to his ordinary simplicity of tone when\nhe swore by those that fought for their country at\nMarathon, Plataea and Salamis, nor did Aeschines\nemploy a colloquial utterance when he lamented for\nthe fate of Thebes. There is also an entirely different\ntone, which might be described as lying almost\n\n\n\noutside the range of the instrument. The Greeks\ncall it bitterness, and it consists in an extravagant\nacerbity almost beyond the compass of the human\nvoice. It is employed in passages such as, \nBut the extravagance of which I spoke will come\nin at the opening, where the orator cries,"}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "170"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "171"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "172"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "173"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "174"}], "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "peroration,"}, "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Brutt."}, "#text": "xxxviii. 141."}, "162.", {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Mil."}, "#text": "xxxvii. 102."}, {"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pro Rab.

There are\nsome persons in whom positive excellences have no\ncharm, while there are others whose very faults give\npleasure. We have seen the greatest of comic actors,\nDemetrius and Stratocles, win their success by\nentirely different merits. But that is the less\nsurprising owing to the fact that the one was at his\nbest in the rles of gods, young men, good fathers\nand slaves, matrons and respectable old women,\nwhile the other excelled in the portrayal of sharptempered old men, cunning slaves, parasites, pimps\nand all the more lively characters of comedy. For\ntheir natural gifts differed. For Demetrius' voice,\nlike his other qualities, had greater charm, while\nthat of Stratocles was the more powerful. But\nyet more noticeable were the incommunicable\npeculiarities of their action. Demetrius showed\nunique gifts in the movements of his hands, in\nhis power to charm his audience by the longdrawn sweetness of his exclamations, the skill with\nwhich he would make his dress seem to puff out\nwith wind as he walked, and the expressive movements of the right side which he sometimes introduced with effect, in all of which things he was\nhelped by his stature and personal beauty. On the\nother hand, Stratocles'  lay in his nimbleness\nand rapidity of movement, in his laugh (which,\nthough not always in keeping with the character\nlie represented, he deliberately employed to awaken\nanswering laughter in his audience), and finally, even\nin the way in which he sank his neck into his\nshoulders. If either of these actors had attempted\nany of his rival's tricks, he would have produced a\n\n\n\nmost unbecoming effect. Consequently, every man\nmust get to know his own peculiarities and must\nconsult not merely the general rules of technique,\nbut his own nature as well with a view to forming\nhis delivery. But there is no law of heaven which\nprohibits the possession of all or at any rate the\nmajority of styles by one and the same person. I\nmust conclude this topic with a remark which applies\nto all my other topics as well, that the prime essential\nis a sense of proportion. For I am not trying to\nform a comic actor, but an orator. Consequently,\nwe need not study all the details of gesture nor, as\nregards our speaking, be pedantic in the use we\nmake of the rules governing punctuation, rhythm\nand appeals to the emotions. For example, if an\nactor has to speak the following lines on the stage:\n\n\n\nhe will hesitate as in doubt, will vary the modulations\nof his voice, together with the movements of hand\nand head. But oratory has a different flavour and\nobjects to elaborate condiments, since it consists in\nserious pleading, not in mimicry. There is, therefore, good reason for the condemnation passed on a\ndelivery which entails the continual alteration of\nfacial expression, annoying restlessness of gesture\nand gusty changes of tone. And it was a wise saying\nthat the ancient orators borrowed from the Greeks,\nas is recorded by Popilius Laenas, to the effect that\nthere is too much  in such delivery. The\ninstructions given by Cicero on this subject, as on all\nothers, are quite admirable; I allude to the passages\n\n\n\nwhich I have already quoted from his  while\nthere are similar observations in the  with\nreference to Marcus Antonius. But to-day a rather\nmore violent form of delivery has come into fashion\nand is demanded of our orators: it is well adapted to\ncertain portions of a speech, but requires to be kept\nunder control.

This is\nessential not merely on account of the fact that, if\nthe powers of eloquence serve only to lend arms to\ncrime, there can be nothing more pernicious than\n\n\n\neloquence to public and private welfare alike, while\nI myself, who have laboured to the best of my ability\nto contribute something of value to oratory, shall have\nrendered the worst of services to mankind, if I forge\nthese weapons not for a soldier, but for a robber.\nBut why speak of myself? Nature herself will have\nproved not a mother, but a stepmother with regard\nto what we deem her greatest gift to man, the gift\nthat distinguishes us from other living things, if she\ndevised the power of speech to be the accomplice of\ncrime, the foe to innocency and the enemy of truth.\nFor it had been better for men to be born dumb and\ndevoid of reason than to turn the gifts of providence\nto their mutual destruction. But this conviction of\nmine goes further.

But if the view that a bad\nman is necessarily a fool is not merely held by philosolphers, but is the universal belief of ordinary men,\nthe fool will most assuredly never become an orator.\nTo this must be added the fact that the mind will\nnot find leisure even for the study of the noblest of\ntasks, unless it first be free from vice. The reasons for\nthis are, first, that vileness and virtue cannot jointly\ninhabit in the selfsame heart and that it is as impossible for one and the same mind to harbour good\n\n\n\nand evil thoughts as it is for one man to be at once\nboth good and evil: and secondly, that if the intelligence is to be concentrated on such a vast subject as\neloquence it must be free from all other distractions,\namong which must be included even those preoccupations which are free from blame. For it is only\nwhen it is free and self-possessed, with nothing to\ndivert it or lure it elsewhere, that it will fix its\nattention solely on that goal, the attainment of which\nis the object of its preparations. If on the other\nhand inordinate care for the development of our\nestates, excess of anxiety over household affairs,\npassionate devotion to hunting or the sacrifice of\nwhole days to the shows of the theatre, rob our\nstudies of much of the time that is their due (for\nevery moment that is given to other things involves\na loss of time for study), what, think you, will be the\nresults of desire, avarice, and envy, which waken such\nviolent thoughts within our souls that they disturb\nour very slumbers and our dreams? There is nothing\nso preoccupied, so distracted, so rent and torn by so\nmany and such varied passions as an evil mind. For\nwhen it cherishes some dark design, it is tormented\nwith hope, care and anguish of spirit, and even when\nit has accomplished its criminal purpose, it is racked\nby anxiety, remorse and the fear of all manner of\npunishments. Amid such passions as these what\nroom is there for literature or any virtuous pursuit?\nYou might as well look for fruit in land that is choked\nwith thorns and brambles. Well then, I ask you, is\nnot simplicity of life essential if we are to be able to\nendure the toil entailed by study? What can we\nhope to get from lust or luxury? Is not the desire\nto win praise one of the strongest stimulants to a\n\n\n\npassion for literature? But does that mean that we\nare to suppose that praise is an object of concern to\nbad men? Surely every one of my readers must by\nnow have realised that oratory is in the main concerned with the treatment of what is just and\nhonourable? Can a bad and unjust man speak on\nsuch themes as the dignity of the subject demands?\nNay, even if we exclude the most important aspects\nof the question now before us, and make the impossible concession that the best and worst of men\nmay have the same talent, industry and learning, we\nare still confronted by the question as to which of\nthe two is entitled to be called the better orator. The\nanswer is surely clear enough: it will be he who is\nthe better man. Consequently, the bad man and the\nperfect orator can never be identical. For nothing\nis perfect, if there exists something else that is\nbetter. However, as I do not wish to appear to\nadopt the practice dear to the Socratics of framing\nanswers to my own questions, let me assume the\nexistence of a man so obstinately blind to the truth\nas to venture to maintain that a bad man equipped\nwith the same talents, industry and learning will\nbe not a whit inferior to the good man as an\norator; and let me show that he too is mad.\nThere is one point at any rate which no one will\nquestion, namely, that the aim of every speech is to\nconvince the judge that the case which it puts forward is true and honourable. Well then, which will\ndo this best, the good man or the bad? The good\nman will without doubt more often say what is true\nand honourable. But even supposing that his duty\nshould, as I shall show may sometimes happen, lead\nhim to make statements which are false, his words\n\n\n\nare still certain to carry greater weight with his\naudience. On the other hand bad men, in their\ncontempt for public opinion and their ignorance of\nwhat is right, sometimes drop their mask unawares,\nand are impudent in the statement of their case and\nshameless in their assertions. Further, in their\nattempt to achieve the impossible they display an\nunseemly persistency and unavailing energy. For\nin lawsuits no less than in the ordinary paths of\nlife, they cherish depraved expectations.

My reply will be\nhighly unpopular and I must first attempt to conciliate my audience. I do not consider that\nDemosthenes deserves the serious reflexions that\nhave been made upon his character to such an\nextent that I am bound to believe all the charges\namassed against him by his enemies; for my reading\ntells me that his public policy was of the noblest and\nhis end most glorious. Again, I cannot see that the\naims of Cicero were in any portion of his career other\nthan such as may become an excellent citizen. As\nevidence I would cite the fact that his behaviour as\nconsul was magnificent and his administration of his\nprovince a model of integrity, while he refused to\n\n\n\nbecome one of the twenty commissioners, and in the\ngrievous civil wars which afflicted his generation\nbeyond all others, neither hope nor fear ever deterred\nhim from giving his support to the better party, that\nis to say, to the interests of the common weal.\nSome, it is true, regard him as lacking in courage.\nThe best answer to these critics is to be found in his\nown words, to the effect that he was timid not in\nconfronting peril, but in anticipating it. And this\nhe proved also by the manner of his death, in meeting\nwhich he displayed a singular fortitude. But even\nif these two men lacked the perfection of virtue, I\nwill reply to those who ask if they were orators, in\nthe manner in which the Stoics would reply, if asked\nwhether Zeno, Cleanthes or Chrysippus himself were\nwise men. I shall say that they were great men\ndeserving our veneration, but that they did not\nattain to that which is the highest perfection\nof man's nature. For did not Pythagoras desire\nthat he should not be called a wise man, like the\nsages who preceded him, but rather a student of\nwisdom? But for my own part, conforming to the\nlanguage of every day, I have said time and again,\nand shall continue to say, that Cicero was a perfect\norator, just as in ordinary speech we call our friends\ngood and sensible men, although neither of these\ntitles can really be given to any save to him that\nhas attained to perfect wisdom. But if I am called\nupon to speak strictly and in accordance with the\nmost rigid laws of truth, I shall proclaim that I seek\nto find that same perfect orator whom Cicero also\nsought to discover. For while I admit that he stood\non the loftiest pinnacle of eloquence, and can discover scarcely a single deficiency in him, although I\n\n\n\nmight perhaps discover certain superfluities which I\nthink he would have pruned away (for the general\nview of the learned is that he possessed many virtues\nand a few faults, and he himself states that he has\nsucceeded in suppressing much of his youthful\nexuberance), none the less, in view of the fact that,\nalthough he had by no means a low opinion of himself, he never claimed to be the perfect sage, and,\nhad he been granted longer life and less troubled conditions for the composition of his works, would doubtless have spoken better still, I shall not lay myself\nopen to the charge of ungenerous criticism, if I say\nthat I believe that he failed actually to achieve that\nperfection to the attainment of which none have\napproached more nearly, and indeed had I felt otherwise in this connexion, I might have defended my\npoint with greater boldness and freedom. Marcus\nAntonius declared that he had seen no man who was\ngenuinely eloquent (and to be eloquent is a far less\nachievement than to be an orator), while Cicero himself has failed to find his orator in actual life and\nmerely imagines and strives to depict the ideal. Shall\nI then be afraid to say that in the eternity of time\nthat is yet to be, something more perfect may be found\nthan has yet existed? I say nothing of those critics\nwho will not allow sufficient credit even for eloquence\nto Cicero and Demosthenes, although Cicero himself\ndoes not regard Demosthenes as flawless, but asserts\nthat he sometimes nods, while even Cicero fails to\nsatisfy Brutus and Calvus (at any rate they criticised\nhis style to his face), or to win the complete approval\nof either of the Asinii, who in various passages attack\nthe faults of his oratory in language which is positively\nhosthe."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "26"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "27"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "28"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "29"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "30"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "31"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "32"}], "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "causidici,"}, "pb": [{"@id": "p.371"}, {"@id": "p.373"}], "note": {"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Aen."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "sqq."}], "#text": "i. 151"}, "quote": [{"@rend": "blockquote", "quote": {"l": ["Then, if before their eyes some statesman grave", "Stand forth, with virtue and high service crowned,", "Straight are they dumb and stand intent to hear."]}}, {"@rend": "blockquote", "l": {"quote": "His words their minds control, their passions soothe."}}], "#text": "However, let us fly in the face of nature and\nassume that a bad man has been discovered who is\nendowed with the highest eloquence.

But if the quality which is\nusually termed goodness is to be found even in quite\nordinary advocates, why should not the orator, who\nhas not yet existed, but may still be born, be no less\nperfect in character than in excellence of speech?\nIt is no hack-advocate, no hireling pleader, nor yet,\nto use no harser term, a serviceable attorney of the\nclass generally known as  that I am seeking to\nform, but rather a man who to extraordinary natural\ngifts has added a thorough mastery of all the fairest\nbranches of knowledge, a man sent by heaven to be\nthe blessing of mankind, one to whom all history\ncan find no parallel, uniquely perfect in every detail\nand utterly noble alike in thought and speech. How\nsmall a portion of all these abilities will be required\nfor the defence of the innocent, the repression of\ncrime or the support of truth against falsehood in\nsuits involving questions of money? It is true that\nour supreme orator will bear his part in such tasks,\nbut his powers will be displayed with brighter splendour in greater matters than these, when he is\ncalled upon to direct the counsels of the senate and\n\n\n\nguide the people from the paths of error to better\nthings. Was not this the man conceived by Virgil\nand described as quelling a riot when torches and\nstones have begun to fly:\n\n\n\nHere then we have one who is before all else a\ngood man, and it is only after this that the poet adds\nthat he is skilled in speaking:\n\n\n\nAgain, will not this same man, whom we are striving\nto form, if in time of war he be called upon to inspire\nhis soldiers with courage for the fray, draw for his\neloquence on the innermost precepts of philosophy?\nFor how can men who stand upon the verge of battle\nbanish all the crowding fears of hardship, pain and\ndeath from their minds, unless those fears be replaced by the sense of the duty that they owe\ntheir country, by courage and the lively image of a\nsoldier's honour? And assuredly the man who will\nbest inspire such feelings in others is he who has\nfirst inspired them in himself. For however we strive\nto conceal it, insincerity will always betray itself, and\nthere was never in any man so great eloquence as\nwould not begin to stumble and hesitate so soon as\nhis words ran counter to his inmost thoughts. Now:\na bad man cannot help speaking things other than\nhe feels. On the other land, the good will never be\nat a loss for honourable words or fail to find matter\nfull of virtue for utterance, since among his virtues\npractical wisdom will be one. And even though his\n\n\n\nimagination lacks artifice to lend it charm, its own\nnature will be ornament enough, for if honour dictate\nthe words, we shall find eloquence there as well.\nTherefore, let those that are young, or rather let all\nof us, whatever our age, since it is never too late to\nresolve to follow what is right, strive with all our\nhearts and devote all our efforts to the pursuit of virtue\nand eloquence; and perchance it may be granted to us\nto attain to the perfection that we seek. For since\nnature does not forbid the attainment of either, why\nshould not someone succeed in attaining both together? And why should not each of us hope to be\nthat happy man? But if our powers are inadequate\nto such achievement, we shall still be the better for\nthe double effort in proportion to the distance which\nwe have advanced toward either goal. At any rate\nlet us banish from our hearts the delusion that\neloquence, the fairest of all things, can be combined\nwith vice.

For it is by no\nmeans useless to consider how at times we should\nspeak in defence of falsehood or even of injustice, if\nonly for this reason, that such an investigation will\nenable us to detect and defeat them with the greater\nease, just as the physician who has a thorough\nknowledge of all that can injure the health will be\nall the more skilful in the prescription of remedies.\nFor the Academicians, although they will argue on\neither side of a question, do not thereby commit\nthemselves to taking one of these two views as their\nguide in life to the exclusion of the other, while the\nfamous Carneades, who is said to have spoken at\nRome in the presence of Cato the Censor, and to\nhave argued against justice with no less vigour than\nhe had argued for justice on the preceding day, was\nnot himself an unjust man. But the nature of virtue\nis revealed by vice, its opposite, justice becomes yet\nmore manifest from the contemplation of injustice,\nand there are many other things that are proved by\ntheir contraries. Consequently the schemes of his\nadversaries should be no less well known to the\norator than those of the enemy to a commander in\nthe field. But it is even true, although at first sight\nit seems hard to believe, that there may be sound\nreason why at times a good man who is appearing\nfor the defence should attempt to conceal the truth\nfrom the judge. If any of my readers is surprised\nat my making such a statement (although this\nopinion is not of my own invention, but is derived\nfrom those whom antiquity regarded as the greatest\nteachers of wisdom), I would have him reflect that\n\n\n\nthere are many things which are made honourable\nor the reverse not by the nature of the facts, but by\nthe causes from which they spring. For if to slay\na man is often a virtue and to put one's own children\nto death is at times the noblest of deeds, and if it\nis permissible in the public interest to do deeds\nyet more horrible to relate than these, we should\nassuredly take into consideration not solely and\nsimply what is the nature of the case which the\ngood man undertakes to defend, but what is his\nreason and what his purpose in so doing. And first\nof all everyone must allow, what even the sternest\nof the Stoics admit, that the good man will sometimes tell a lie, and further that he will sometimes do\nso for comparatively trivial reasons; for example we\ntell countless lies to sick children for their good and\nmake many promises to them which we do not intend\nto perform. And there is clearly far more justification for lying when it is a question of diverting\nan assassin from his victim or deceiving an enemy\nto save our country. Consequently a practice which\nis at times reprehensible even in slaves, may on\nother occasions be praiseworthy even in a wise man.\nIf this be granted, I can see that there will be many\npossible emergencies such as to justify an orator in\nundertaking cases of a kind which, in the absence of\nany honourable reason, he would have refused to\ntouch. In saying this I do not mean that we should\nbe ready under any circumstances to defend our\nfather, brother or friend when in peril (since I\nhold that we should be guided by stricter rules in\nsuch matters), although such contingencies may\nwell cause us no little perplexity, when we have to\ndecide between the rival claims of justice and natural\n\n\n\naffection. But let us put the problem beyond all\nquestion of doubt. Suppose a man to have plotted\nagainst a tyrant and to be accused of having done so.\nWhich of the two will the orator, as defined by us,\ndesire to save? And if he undertakes the defence\nof the accused, will he not employ falsehood with\nno less readiness than the advocate who is defending\na bad case before a jury? Again, suppose that the\njudge is likely to condemn acts which were rightly\ndone, unless we can convince him that they were\nnever done. Is not this another case where the\norator will not shrink even from lies, if so he may\nsave one who is not merely innocent, but a praiseworthy citizen? Again, suppose that we realise that\ncertain acts are just in themselves, though prejudicial\nto the state under existing circumstances. Shall we\nnot then employ methods of speaking which, despite\nthe excellence of their intention, bear a close resemblance to fraud. Further, no one will hesitate\nfor a moment to hold the view that it is in the\ninterests of the commonwealth that guilty persons\nshould be acquitted rather than punished, if it be\npossible thereby to convert them to a better state of\nmind, a possibility which is generally conceded. If\nthen it is clear to an orator that a man who is guilty\nof the offences laid to his charge will become a good\nman, will he not strive to secure his acquittal?\nImagine for example that a skilful commander, without whose aid the state cannot hope to crush its\nenemies, is labouring under a charge which is obviously true: will not the common interest irresistibly\nsummon our orator to defend him? We know at\nany rate that Fabricius publicly voted for and secured\nthe election to the consulate of Cornelius Rufinus,\n\n\n\ndespite the tact that he was a bad citizen and his\npersonal enemy, merely because he knew that he\nwas a capable general and the state was threatened\nwith war. And when certain persons expressed\ntheir surprise at his conduct, he replied that he had\nrather be robbed by a fellow-citizen than be sold as\na slave by the enemy. Well then, had Fabricius\nbeen an orator, would he not have defended Rufinus\nagainst a charge of peculation, even though his\nguilt were as clear as day? I might produce many\nother similar examples, but one of them taken at\nrandom is enough. For my purpose is not to\nassert that such tasks will often be incumbent\non the orator whom I desire to form, but merely to\nshow that, in the event of his being compelled to\ntake such action, it will not invalidate our definition\nof an orator as a \nAnd it is necessary also both to teach and learn how\nto establish difficult cases by proof. For often even\nthe best cases have a resemblance to bad and, the\ncharges which tell heavily against an innocent person frequently have a strong resemblance to the\ntruth. Consequently, the same methods of defence\nhave to be employed that would be used if he were\nguilty. Further, there are countless elements which\nare common to both good cases and bad, such as oral\nand documentary evidence, suspicions and opinions,\nall of which have to be established or disposed of in\nthe same way, whether they be true or merely resemble the truth. Therefore, while maintaining his\nintegrity of purpose, the orator will modify his pleading to suit the circumstances."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.383"}, {"@id": "p.385"}, {"@id": "p.387"}], "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Oratore,"}, "note": "Chs. xx. xxvii. and xxxi.", "quote": "wise man", "#text": "Since then the orator is a good man, and such\ngoodness cannot be conceived as existing apart from\n\n\n\nvirtue, virtue, despite the fact that it is in part\nderived from certain natural impulses, will require to\nbe perfected by instruction. The orator must above\nall things devote his attention to the formation of\nmoral character and must acquire a complete knowledge of all that is just and honourable. For without\nthis knowledge no one can be either a good man or\nskilled in speaking, unless indeed we agree with\nthose who regard morality as intuitive and as owing\nnothing to instruction: indeed they go so far as to\nacknowledge that handicrafts, not excluding even\nthose which are most despised among them, can\nonly be acquired by the result of teaching, whereas\nvirtue, which of all gifts to man is that which makes\nhim most near akin to the immortal gods, comes to\nhim without search or effort, as a natural concomitant\nof birth. But can the man who does not know what\nabstinence is, claim to be truly abstinent? or brave, if\nhe has never purged his soul of the fears of pain, death\nand superstition? or just, it he has never, in language\napproaching that of philosophy, discussed the nature\nof virtue and justice, or of the laws that have been\ngiven to mankind by nature or established among\nindividual peoples and nations? What a contempt\nit argues for such themes to regard them as being\nso easy of comprehension! However, I pass this by;\nfor I am sure that no one with the least smattering\nof literary culture will have the slightest hesitation\nin agreeing with me. I will proceed to my next\npoint, that no one will achieve sufficient skill even in\nspeaking, unless he makes a thorough study of all\nthe workings of nature and forms his character on\nthe precepts of philosophy and the dictates of reason.\nFor it is with good cause that Lucius Crassus, in the\n\n\n\nthird book of the  affirms that all that is\nsaid concerning equity, justice, truth and the good,\nand their opposites, forms part of the studies of an\norator, and that the philosophers, when they exert\ntheir powers of speaking to defend these virtues, are\nusing the weapons of rhetoric, not their own. But\nhe also confesses that the knowledge of these subjects must be sought from the philosophers for the\nreason that, in his opinion, philosophy has more\neffective possession of them. And it is for the same\nreason that Cicero in several of his books and letters\nproclaims that eloquence has its fountain-head in the\nmost secret springs of wisdom, and that consequently\nfor a considerable time the instructors of morals and\nof eloquence were identical. Accordingly this exhortation of mine must not be taken to mean that I\nwish the orator to be a philosopher, since there is no\nother way of life that is further removed from the\nduties of a statesman and the tasks of an orator.\nFor what philosopher has ever been a frequent\nspeaker in the courts or won renown in public\nassemblies? Nay, what philosopher has ever taken a\nprominent part in the government of the state, which\nforms the most frequent theme of their instructions?\nNone the less I desire that he, whose character I am\nseeking to mould, should be a  in the\nRoman sense, that is, one who reveals himself as a true\nstatesman, not in the discussions of the study, but\nin the actual practice and experience of life. But\ninasmuch as the study of philosophy has been\ndeserted by those who have turned to the pursuit of\neloquence, and since philosophy no longer moves in\nits true sphere of action and in the broad daylight of\nthe forum, but has retired first to porches and\n\n\n\ngymnasia and finally to the gatherings of the schools, all\nthat is essential for an orator, and yet is not taught\nby the professors of eloquence, must undoubtedly be\nsought from those persons in whose possession it\nhas remained. The authors who have discoursed on\nthe nature of virtue must be read through and\nthrough, that the life of the orator may be wedded\nto the knowledge of things human and divine. But\nhow much greater and fairer would such subjects\nappear if those who taught them were also those\nwho could give them most eloquent expression! O\nthat the day may dawn when the perfect orator of\nour heart's desire shall claim for his own possession\nthat science that has lost the affection of mankind\nthrough the arrogance of its claims and the vices of\nsome that have brought disgrace upon its virtues,\nand shall restore it to its place in the domain of\neloquence, as though he had been victorious in a\ntrial for the restoration of stolen goods!

Our orator will also require a knowledge of\ncivil law and of the custom and religion of the state\nin whose life he is to bear his part. For how will he\nbe able to advise either in public or in private, if he\nis ignorant of all the main elements that go to make\nthe state? How can he truthfully call himself an\nadvocate if he has to go to others to acquire that\nknowledge which is all-important in the courts?\nHe will be little better than if he were a reciter of\nthe poets. For he will be a mere transmitter of the\ninstructions that others have given him, it will be on\nthe authority of others that he propounds what he\nasks the judge to believe, and he whose duty it is to\nsuccour the litigant will himself be in need of succour.\nIt is true that at times this may be effected with but\nlittle inconvenience, if what he advances for the\nedification of the judge has been taught him and\ncomposed in the seclusion of his study and learnt by\nheart there like other elements of the case. But\nwhat will he do, when he is confronted by unexpected\nproblems such as frequently arise in the actual\ncourse of pleading? Will he not disgrace himself by looking round and asking the junior counsel\nwho sit on the benches behind him for advice? Can\nlie hope to get a thorough grasp of such information\nat the very moment when he is required to produce\nit in his speech? Can he make his assertions with\nconfidence or speak with native simplicity as though\nhis arguments were his own? Grant that he may do\nso in his actual speech. But what will he do in a\ndebate, when he has continually to meet fresh points\nraised by his opponent and is given no time to learn\n\n\n\nup his case? What will do, if he has no legal\nexpert to advise him or if his prompter through\ninsufficient knowledge of the subject provides him\nwith information that is false? It is the most serious\ndrawback of such ignorance, that he will always\nbelieve that his adviser knows what he is talking\nabout. I am not ignorant of the generally prevailing custom, nor have I forgotten those who sit by\nour store-chests and provide weapons for the pleader:\nI know too that the Greeks did likewise: hence\nthe name of  which was bestowed on\nsuch persons. But I am speaking of an orator, who\nowes it as a duty to his case to serve it not merely\nby the loudness of his voice, but by all other means\nthat may be of assistance to it. Consequently I do\nnot wish my orator to be helpless, if it so chance\nthat he puts in an appearance for the preliminary\nproceedings to which the hour before the commencement of the trial is allotted, or to be unskilful in\nthe preparation and production of evidence. For\nwho, sooner than himself, should prepare the points\nwhich he wishes to be brought out when he is\npleading? You might as well suppose that the\nqualifications of a successful general consist merely\nin courage and energy in the field of battle and skill\nin meeting all the demands of actual conflict, while\nsuffering him to be ignorant of the methods of levying troops, mustering and equipping his forces,\narranging for supplies or selecting a suitable position\nfor his camp, despite the fact that preparation for\nwar is an essential preliminary for its successful\nconduct. And yet such a general would bear a\nvery close resemblance to the advocate who leaves\nmuch of the detail that is necessary for success to\n\n\n\nthe care of others, more especially in view of the\nfact that this, the most necessary element in the\nmanagement of a case, is not as difficult as it may\nperhaps seem to outside observers. For every point\nof law, which is certain, is based either on written\nlaw or accepted custom: if, on the other hand, the\npoint is doubtful, it must be examined in the light\nof equity. Laws which are either written or founded\non accepted custom present no difficulty, since they\ncall merely for knowledge and make no demand on\nthe imagination. On the other hand, the points explained in the rulings of the legal experts turn either\non the interpretation of words or on the distinction\nbetween right and wrong. To understand the meaning of each word is either common to all sensible\nmen or the special possession of the orator, while\nthe demands of equity are known to every good\nman. Now I regard the orator above all as being\na man of virtue and good sense, who will not be\nseriously troubled, after having devoted himself to\nthe study of that which is excellent by nature, if\nsome legal expert disagrees with him; for even they\nare allowed to disagree among themselves. But if\nhe further wishes to know the views of everyone,\nhe will require to read, and reading is the least\nlaborious of' all the tasks that fall to the student's\nlot. Moreover, if the class of legal experts is as a rule\ndrawn from those who, in despair of making successful pleaders, have taken refuge with the law,\nhow easy it must be for an orator to know what\nthose succeed in learning, who by their own confession are incapable of becoming orators! But\nMarcus Cato was at once a great orator and an\nexpert lawyer, while Scaevola and Servius Sulpicius\n\n\n\nwere universally allowed to be eloquent as well.\nAnd Cicero not merely possessed a sufficient supply of\nlegal knowledge to serve his needs when pleading,\nbut actually began to write on the subject, so that\nit is clear that an orator has not merely time to\nlearn, but even to teach the law."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "in albo"}, "#text": "The piraetor's edicts were displayed on a whitened board\n(), while the headings of the civil law were written in\nred."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Or."}, "#text": "I. iv. 231."}], "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "formulae,"}, "#text": "Let no one, however, regard the advice I have\ngiven as to the attention due to the development\nof character and the study of the law as being\nimpugned by the fact that we are familiar with\nmany who, because they were weary of the toil\nentailed on those who seek to scale the heights\nof eloquence, have betaken themselves to the study\nof law as a refuge for their indolence.

In my opinion we should aim\n\n\n\nat a happy mean. The unripe brow of boyhood\nshould not be prematurely robbed of its ingenuous\nair nor should the young speaker's powers be brought\nbefore the public while yet unformed, since such a\npractice leads to a contempt for study, lays the\nfoundations of impudence and induces a fault which\nis pernicious in all departments of life, namely, a self-confidence that is not justified by the speaker's\nresources. On the other hand, it is undesirable to\npostpone the apprenticeship of the bar till old age:\nfor the fear of appearing in public grows daily and\nthe magnitude of the task on which we must venture\ncontinually increases and we waste time deliberating\nwhen we should begin, till we find it is too late to\nbegin at all. Consequently it is desirable that the\nfruit of our studies should be brought before the\npublic eye while it is still fresh and sweet, while it\nmay hope for indulgence and be secure of a kindly\ndisposition in the audience, while boldness is not\nunbecoming and youth compensates for all defects\nand boyish extravagance is regarded as a sign of\nnatural vigour. Take for example the whole of the\nwell-known passage from Cicero's defence of Sextus\nRoscius: \netc. This passage was delivered at the age of\ntwenty-six amid loud applause from the audience,\nbut in later years he acknowledges that the ferment\nof youth has died down and his style been clarified\nwith age. And, indeed, however much private study\nmay contribute to success, there is still a peculiar\nproficiency that the courts alone can give: for there\nthe atmosphere is changed and the reality of the\n\n\n\nperil puts a different complexion on things, while, if\nit is impossible to combine the two, practice without\ntheory is more useful than theory without practice.\nConsequently, some who have grown old in the\nschools lose their heads when confronted by the\nnovelty of the law courts and wish that it were\npossible to reproduce all the conditions under which\nthey delivered their exercises. But there sits the\njudge in silence, their opponent bellows at them, no\nrash utterance passes unnoticed and all assumptions\nmust be proved, the clock cuts short the speech that\nhas been laboriously pieced together at the cost of\nhours of study both by day and night, and there are\ncertain cases which require simplicity of language and\nthe abandonment of the perpetual bombast of the\nschools, a fact which these fluent fellows completely\nfail to realise. And so you will find some persons\nwho regard themselves as too eloquent to speak in\nthe courts. On the other hand, the man, whom we\nconducted to the forum while still young and in the\ncharm of immaturity, should begin with as easy and\nfavourable a case as may be (just as the cubs of wild\nbeasts are brought up to start with on softer\nforms of prey), and should not proceed straight\nfrom this commencement to plead case after case\nwithout a break, or cause his talents to set and\nharden while they still require nourishment; on the\ncontrary, as soon as he has come to realise the nature\nof the conflicts in which he will have to engage and\nthe object to which his studies should be directed, he\nshould take an interval of rest and refreshment.\nThus, at an age to which boldness is still natural, he\nwill find it easy to get over the timidity which invariably accompanies the period of apprenticeship, and\n\n\n\nwill not, on the other hand, carry his boldness so far\nas to lead him to despise the difficulties of his task.\nThis was the method employed by Cicero: for when\nhe had already won a distinguished position at the\nbar of his day, he took ship to Asia and there studied\nunder a number of professors of philosophy and\nrhetoric, but above all under Apollonius Molon,\nwhose lectures he had attended at Rome and to\nwhom he now at Rhodes entrusted the refashioning\nand recasting of his style.

For the laws themselves would be\npowerless without the assistance of advocates equal\nto the task of supporting them; and to regard it as a\nsin to demand the punishment of crime is almost equivalent to the sanctioning of crime, while it is certainly\ncontrary to the interest of the good to give the\nwicked free leave to work their will. Therefore, our\norator will not suffer the complaints of our allies, the\ndeath of friends or kinsmen, or conspiracies that\nthreaten the common weal to go unavenged, while\nhis conduct will be governed not by a passion to\nsecure the punishment of the guilty, but by the\n\n\n\ndesire to correct vice and reform morals. For fear\nis the only means of restraining those who cannot\nbe led to better ways by the voice of reason. Consequently, while to devote one's life to the task of\naccusation, and to be tempted by the hope of reward\nto bring the guilty to trial is little better than making\none's living by highway robbery, none the less to rid\none's country of the pests that gnaw its vitals is\nconduct worthy of comparison with that of heroes,\nwho champion their country's cause in the field of\nbattle. For this reason men who were leaders of the\nstate have not refused to undertake this portion of\nan orator's duty, and even young men of high rank\nhave been regarded as giving their country a pledge\nof their devotion by accusing bad citizens, since it\nwas thought that their hatred of evil and their\nreadiness to incur enmity were proofs of their confidence in their own rectitude.

On the other\nhand, this same orator of ours will not defend all and\nsundry: that haven of safety which his eloquence\nprovides will never be opened to pirates as it is to\nothers, and he will be led to undertake cases mainly\nby consideration of their nature. However, since\none man cannot undertake the cases of all litigants\nwho are not, as many undoubtedly are, dishonest, he\nwill be influenced to some extent by the character\nof the persons who recommend clients to his protection and also by the character of the litigants\nthemselves, and will allow himself to be moved by\n\n\n\nthe wishes of all virtuous men; for a good man will\nnaturally have such for his most intimate friends.\nBut he must put away from him two kinds of\npretentious display, the one consisting in the\nofficious proffering of his services to the powerful\nagainst those of meaner position, and the other,\nwhich is even more obtrusive, in deliberately supporting inferiors against those of high degree. For a\ncase is not rendered either just or the reverse by the\nsocial position of the parties engaged. Nor, again,\nwill a sense of shame deter him from throwing over\na case which he has undertaken in the belief that it\nhad justice on its side, but which his study of the\nfacts has shown to be unjust, although before doing\nso he should give his client his true opinion on the\ncase. For, if we judge aright, there is no greater\nbenefit that we can confer on our clients than this,\nthat we should not cheat them by giving them empty\nhopes of success. On the other hand, no client that\ndoes not take his advocate into his counsel deserves\nthat advocate's assistance, and it is certainly unworthy\nof our ideal orator that he should wittingly defend\ninjustice.

On the other hand, if his\ndomestic circumstances are such as to require some\naddition to his income to enable him to meet the\nnecessary demands upon his purse, there is not a\nphilosopher who would forbid him to accept this form\nof recompense for his services, since collections were\nmade even on behalf of Socrates, and Zeno, Cleanthes\nand Chrysippus took fees from their pupils.

But as it is, they add suggestions of their own, put their own construction on\nthe facts and insert inventions which are far more\ndamaging than the unvarnished truth. And then\nthe advocate as a rule, on receiving the document,\nregards it as a crime to make any alteration, and\nkeeps to it as faithfully as if it were a theme set for\ndeclamation in the schools. The sequel is that they\nare tripped up and have to learn from their opponents the case which they refused to learn from their\nown clients. We should therefore above all allow\nthe parties concerned ample time for an interview in\na place free from interruption, and should even\nexhort them to set forth on the spot all the facts in\nas many words as they may choose to use and allowing them to go as far back as they please. For it is\nless of a drawback to listen to a number of irrelevant\nfacts than to be left in ignorance of essentials.\nMoreover, the orator will often detect both the evil\nand its remedy in facts which the litigant regarded\nas devoid of all importance, one way or the other.\nFurther, the advocate who has got to plead the case\nshould not put such excessive confidence in his\npowers of memory as to disdain to jot down what he\nhas heard."}, {"pb": {"@id": "p.433"}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}], "#text": "Nor should one hearing be regarded as sufficient.\nThe litigant should be made to repeat his statements\nat least once, not merely because certain points may\nhave escaped him on the occasion of his first statement, as is extremely likely to happen if, as is often\nthe case, he is a man of no education, but also that\nwe may note whether he sticks to what he originally\n\n\n\nsaid.

Above all it is important that he\nshould never, like so many, be led by a desire to win\napplause to neglect the interest of the actual case.\nIt is not always the duty of generals in the field to\nlead their armies through flat and smiling country:\nit will often be necessary to cross rugged mountain\nranges, to storm cities placed on inaccessible cliffs or\nrendered difficult of access by elaborate fortifications.\nSimilarly oratory will always be glad of the opportunity of manuvring in all its freedom and delighting the spectator by the deployment of its full\nstrength for conflict in the open field; but if it is\nforced to enter the tortuous defiles of the law, or\ndark places whence the truth has to be dragged\nforth, it will not go prancing in front of the enemy's\nlines nor launch its shafts of quivering and passionate\nepigram of the fashion that is now so popular, but\nwill wage war by means of sap and mine and ambush\nand all the tactics of secrecy. None of these\nmethods win applause during their actual execution:\nthe reward comes after they have been carried to a\nsuccessful termination, when even the most ambitious\n\n\n\nwill reap a richer recompense than they could ever\nhave secured by other means. For so soon as the\nthunders of applause awakened among their admirers\nby these affected declamatory displays have died\naway, the glory of true virtue rises again with\nrenewed splendour, the judges do not conceal who\nit is has moved them, the well-trained orator wins\ntheir belief and oratory receives its only genuine\ntribute, the praise accorded it when its task is done.\nThe old orators indeed used to conceal their eloquence, a method which is recommended by Marcus\nAntonius, as a means of securing that the speaker's\nwords should carry conviction and of masking the\nadvocate's real designs. But the truth is that the\neloquence of those days was capable of concealment,\nfor it had not yet attained that splendour of diction\nwhich makes it impossible to hide its light under a\nbushel. Therefore artifice and stratagem should be\nmasked, since detection in such cases spells failure.\nThus far, and thus only, may eloquence hope to enjoy\nthe advantages of secrecy. But when we come to\nconsider the choice of words, the weight essential\nto general reflexions and the elegance demanded by\nfigures, we are confronted by elements which must\neither strike the attention or be condemned to nonexistence. But the very fact that they strike the\nattention is a reason why they should not flaunt\nthemselves obtrusively. And, if we have to make\nthe choice, I should prefer that it should be the\ncause, and not the orator, to which we award our\npraise. Nevertheless, the true orator will achieve\nthe distinction of seeming to speak with all the\nexcellence that an excellent case deserves. One\nthing may be regarded as certain, that no one can\n\n\n\nplead worse than he who wins applause despite the\ndisapproval meted out to his case. For the inevitable\nconclusion is that the applause must have been\nevoked by something having no connexion with the\ncase. Further, the true orator will not turn up his\nnose at cases of minor importance on the ground of\ntheir being beneath his dignity or as being likely\nto detract from his reputation because the subject\nmatter does not allow his genius full scope. For the\nstrongest reason for undertaking a case is to be fund\nin our duty towards our clients: nay, we should even\ndesire the suits in which our friends are involved to\nhe as unimportant as possible, and remember that the\nadvocate who gives an adequate presentment to his\ncase, has spoken exceeding well."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}], "note": {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "A cognitor"}, "#text": "is one who represents another.

Such conduct seems to me so\nunworthy of our perfect orator that, in my opinion,\nhe will not even bring true charges against his\nopponents unless the case demand. For it is a\ndog's eloquence, as Appius says, to undertake the\ntask of abusing one's opponent, and they who do so\nshould steel themselves in advance to the prospect\nof being targets for like abuse themselves, since\nthose who adopt this style of pleading are frequently\nattacked themselves, and there can at any rate be\nno doubt that the litigant pays dearly for the violence\n\n\n\nof his advocate. But such faults are less serious than\nthat which lies deep in the soul itself, making the\nevil speaker to differ from the evil doer only in\nrespect of opportunity. It is not uncommon for\nthe litigant to demand a base and inhuman gratification of his rancour, such as not a single man among\nthe audience will approve, for it is on revenge rather\nthan on protection that his heart is set. But in this,\nas in a number of other points, it is the duty of the\norator to refuse to comply with his clients' desires.\nFor how can a man with the least degree of gentlemanly feeling consent to make a brutal attack merely\nbecause another desires it? And yet there are some\nwho take pleasure in directing their onslaughts\nagainst their opponents' counsel as well, a practice\nwhich, unless they have deserved such attacks, shows\nan inhuman disregard of the duties incumbent on the\nprofession, and is not merely useless to the speaker\n(since he thereby gives his opponent the right to\nreply in the same strain), but contrary to the\ninterests of his case, since it creates a hosthe and\nantagonistic disposition in the advocates attacked,\nwhose eloquence, however feeble it may be, will be\nredoubled by resentment at the insults to which\nthey have been subjected. Above all, it involves a\ncomplete waste of one of the most valuable of an\norator's assets, namely that self-restraint which gives\nweight and credit to his words, if he debases himself from an honest man into a snarling wrangler,\ndirecting all his efforts not to win the goodwill of the\njudge, but to gratify his client's spite. Often too\nthe attractions of freedom of speech will lure him\ninto a rashness of language perilous not merely to\nthe interests of the case, but to those of the speaker\n\n\n\nhimself. It was not without good reason that Pericles used to pray that no word might occur to his\nmind that could give offence to the people. But\nwhat he felt with regard to the people, I feel with\nregard to every audience, since they can cause just\nas much harm to the orator as the people could\never do to Pericles.

He will\nshow all the diligence of which he is capable in his\npleading. For to plead worse than he might have\ndone, is not merely an indication of negligence, but\nstamps him as a had man and a traitor, disloyal to the\ncause which he has undertaken. Consequently he\nmust refuse to undertake more cases than he feels\nhe can manage. As far as possible he will deliver\nonly what he has written, and, if circumstances\npermit, only what he has, as Demosthenes says,\ncarved into shape. Such a practice is possible in\nfirst hearings and also in subsequent hearings such as\nare granted in the public courts after an interval of\nseveral days. On the other hand, when we have to\nreply on the spot, it is impossible to prepare everything: in fact for the less ready type of speaker, it\nmay, in the event of his opponents putting forward\narguments quite other than those which they were\nexpected to advance, be a positive drawback to have\n\n\n\nwritten anything. For it is only with reluctance\nthat such speakers will under such circumstances\nconsent to abandon what they have written, and\nthroughout their pleading keep looking back and\ntrying to discover whether any portion of their\nmanuscript can be saved from the wreck and interpolated into what they have to improvise. And if\nthey do make such interpolations, the result is a lack\nof' cohesion which is betrayed not merely by the\ngaping of the seams where the patch has been unskilfully inserted, but by the differences of style.\nConsequently, the vigour of their eloquence will be\nhampered and their thought will lack connexion, each\nof which circumstances reacts unfavourably upon the\nother, since what is written trammels the mind\ninstead of following its lead. Therefore, in such\npleadings we must, as the rustic adage says,  For since the case turns on the\npropounding and refutation of arguments, it is\nalways possible to write out what we propose to\nadvance on our own behalf, and similar preparation\nis also possible with regard to the refutation of such\nreplies as are absolutely certain to be made by our\nadversary: for there are times when we have this\ncertainty. But with regard to all other portions of\nour speech, the only preparation that is possible in\nadvance consists in a thorough knowledge of our\ncase, while there is a second precaution which may\nbe taken in court, consisting in giving our best\nattention to our opponent's speech.

But\nwhether we have to improvise a reply, or are obliged\nto speak extempore by some other reason, the orator\non whom training, study and practice have conferred\nthe gift of facility, will never regard himself as lost\nor taken at hopeless disadvantage. He stands\narmed for battle, ever ready for the fray, and his\neloquence will no more fail him in the courts than\nspeech will fail him in domestic affairs and the daily\nconcerns of life: and he will never shirk his burden\nfor fear of failing to find words, provided he has time\nto study his case: for all other knowledge will always\nbe his at command."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}], "quote": "kind of style", "note": "II. xiv. 5.", "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "species,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "genus"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.451"}, "#text": "The question of the  to be\nadopted remains to be discussed.

In this class we may place orators such as\nLaelius, Africanus, Cato, and even the Gracchi,\nwhom we may call the  and \nof oratory. Among orators of the intermediate\ntype we may rank Lucius Crassus and Quintus\nHortensius. Then let us turn to a vast harvest of\norators who flourished much about the same period.\nIt is here that we find the vigour of Caesar, the\nnatural talent of Caelius, the subtlety of Calidius,\nthe accuracy of Pollio, the dignity of Messala, the\nausterity of Calvus, the gravity of Brutus, the acumen\nof Sulpicius and the bitterness of Cassius, while\namong those whom we have seen ourselves we\nadmire the fluency of Seneca, the strength of Africanus, the mellowness of Afer, the charm of Crispus,\nthe sonority of Trachalus and the elegance of Secundus. But in Cicero we have one who is not,\n\n\n\nlike Euphranor, merely distinguished in a number\nof different forms of art, but is supreme in all the\ndifferent qualities which are praised in each individual\norator. And yet even his own contemporaries\nventured to attack him on the ground that he was\nbombastic, Asiatic, redundant, given to excessive\nrepetition, liable at times to be pointless in his\nwitticisms, sensuous, extravagant and (an outrageous\naccusation!) almost effeminate in his rhythm.

The former were\nregarded as concise and healthy, the latter as empty\nand inflated: the former were remarkable for the\nabsence of all superfluity, while the latter were\ndeficient alike in taste and restraint. The reason\nfor this division, according to some authorities,\namong them Santra, is to be found in the fact that,\nas Greek gradually extended its range into the\nneighbouring cities of Asia, there arose a class of\nmen who desired to distinguish themselves as orators\nbefore they had acquired sufficient command of the\nlanguage, and who consequently began to express\nby periphrases what could have been expressed\ndirectly, until finally this practice became an ingrained habit. My own view, however, is that the\ndifference between the two styles is attributable to\nthe character both of the orators and the audiences\nwhom they addressed: the Athenians, with their\npolish and refinement, refused to tolerate emptiness\nand redundance, while the Asiatics, being naturally\ngiven to bombast and ostentation, were puffed up\nwith a passion for a more vainglorious style of\neloquence. At a later period, the critics, to whom\nwe owe this classification, added a third style, the\nRhodian, which they asserted to he midway between\nthe two and to be a blend of both, since the orators\nof this school are neither so concise as the Attic nor\nredundant like the Asiatic school, but appear to\nderive their style in part from their national characteristics, in part from those of their founder. For\nit was Aeschines who introduced the culture of\n\n\n\nAthens at Rhodes, which he had chosen as his place\nof exile: and just as certain plants degenerate as a\nresult of change of soil and climate, so the fine Attic\nflavour was marred by the admixture of foreign\ningredients.

Does he not rise to great heights in\nhis  Does he not rejoice in the employment of figures? Does he not make brilliant use of\nmetaphor?

For, in the first place, it is\nharsher in sound, since our alphabet does not contain\nthe most euphonious of the Greek letters, one a\nvowel and the other a consonant, than which there\nare none that fall more sweetly on the ear, and\nwhich we are forced to borrow whenever we use\nGreek words. The result of such borrowing is, for\nsome reason or other, the immediate accession to\nour language of a certain liveliness and charm.\nTake, for example, words such as  and \nif they were spelt according to the Latin alphabet,\nthey would produce a heavy and barbarous sound.\nFor we replace these letters by others of a harsh\nand unpleasant character, from which Greece is\nhappily immune. For the sixth letter in our alphabet\nis represented by a sound which can scarcely be\n\n\n\ncalled human or even articulate, being produced by\nforcing the air through the interstices of the teeth.\nSuch a sound, even when followed by a vowel, is\nharsh enough and, as often as it clashes ()\nwith a consonant, as it does in this very word\n becomes harsher still. Then there is the\nAeolic digamma whose sound occurs in words such\nas our  and  for even though we have\nrejected the actual form of the letter, we cannot\nget rid of that which it represents. Similarly the\nletter Q, which is superfluous and useless save for\nthe purpose of attaching to itself the vowels by\nwhich it is followed, results in the formation of\nharsh syllables, as, for example, when we write \nand  more especially since these two vowels\ntogether produce a sound for which Greek has no\nequivalent and which cannot therefore be expressed\nin Greek letters. Again, we have a number of\nwords which end with M, a letter which suggests\nthe mooing of a cow, and is never the final letter\nin any Greek word: for in its place they use the\nletters  the sound of which is naturally pleasant\nand produces a ringing tone when it occurs at the\nend of' a word, whereas in Latin this termination is\nscarcely ever found. Again, we have syllables which\nproduce such a harsh effect by ending in B and\nD, that  not, it is true, of our most ancient\nwriters, but still writers of considerable antiquity,\nhave attempted to mitigate the harshness not merely\nby saying  for  but by adding an S\nto the preposition  although S is an ugly letter\nin itself Our accents also are less agreeable than\nthose of the Greeks. This is due to a certain rigidity\nand monotony of pronunciation, since the final\n\n\n\nsyllable is never marked by the rise of the acute\naccent nor by the rise and fill of the circumflex, but\none or even two grave accents are regularly to be\nfound at the end. Consequently the Greek language\nis so much more agreeable in sound than the Latin,\nthat our poets, whenever they wish their verse to\nbe especially harmonious, adorn it with Greek words.\nA still stronger indication of the inferiority of Latin\nis to be found in the fact that there are many things\nwhich have no Latin names, so that it is necessary\nto express them by metaphor or periphrasis, while\neven in the case of things which have names, the\nextreme poverty of the language leads us to resort\nto the same practice.

This is the orator\nthat will call the dead to life (as, for example, Cicero\ncalls upon Appius Caecus); it is in his pages\nthat his native land itself will cry aloud and at\ntimes address the orator himself, as it addresses\nCicero in the speech delivered against Catiline in\nthe senate. Such an orator will also exalt his style\nby amplification and rise even to  as when\nCicero cries,  or  etc. (I choose these fine passages as being\nfamiliar to the student). It is such an one that\nwill bring down the Gods to form part of his\naudience or even to speak with him, as in the\nfollowing,  This is he that will\ninspire anger or pity, and while he speaks the judge\nwill call upon the gods and weep, following him\nwherever he sweeps him from one emotion to\nanother, and no longer asking merely for instruction.\nWherefore if one of these three styles has to be\nselected to the exclusion of the others, who will\nhesitate to prefer this style to all others, since it\nis by far the strongest and the best adapted to the\nmost important cases? For Homer himself assigns\nto Menelaus an eloquence, terse and pleasing, exact\n(for that is what is meant by ) and devoid of all redundance, which qualities\nare virtues of the first type: and he says that from\nthe lips of Nestor flowed speech sweeter than honey,\nthan which assuredly we can conceive no greater\ndelight: but when he seeks to express the supreme\ngift of eloquence possessed by Ulysses he gives a\nmighty voice and a vehemence of oratory equal to\nthe snows of winter in the abundance and the vigour\nof its words.  he says,  It is this force and impetuosity that Eupolis\nadmires in Pericles, this that Aristophanes compares\nto the thunderbolt, this that is the power of true\neloquence."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "66"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "67"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "68"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.489"}, "#text": "But eloquence cannot be confined even to these\nthree forms of style.

And to have taught what\nlie knows is satisfaction enough for any good man.\nI fear, however, that I may be regarded as setting\ntoo lofty an ideal for the orator by insisting that he\nshould be a good man skilled in speaking, or as\nimposing too many subjects of study on the learner.\nFor in addition to the many branches of knowledge\nwhich have to be studied in boyhood and the traditional rules of eloquence, I have enjoined the study\nof morals and of civil law, so that I am afraid that\neven those who have regarded these things as\nessential to my theme, may he appalled at the delay\nwhich they impose and abandon all hope of achievement before they have put my precepts to the test.\nI would ask them to consider how great are the\npowers of the mind of man and how astonishing its\ncapacity for carrying its desires into execution: for\nhas not man succeeded in crossing the high seas, in\nlearning the number and the courses of the stars,\nand almost measuring the universe itself, all of them\naccomplishments of less importance than oratory, but\nof far greater difficulty? And then let them reflect\non the greatness of' their aims and on the fact that\nno labour should be too huge for those that are\nbeckoned by the hope of such reward. If they can\nonly rise to the height of this conception, they will\nfind it easier to enter on this portion of their task,\nand will cease to regard the road as impassable or\neven hard. For the first and greatest of' the aims\nwe set before us, namely that we shall be good\n\n\n\nmen, depends for its achievement mainly on the\nwill to succeed: and he that truly and sincerely\nforms such resolve, will easily acquire those forms\nof knowledge that teach the way to virtue. For\nthe precepts that are enjoined upon us are not\nso complex or so numerous that they may be\nacquired by little more than a few years' study. It\nis repugnance to learn that makes such labour long.\nFor if you will only believe it, you will quickly learn\nthe principles that shall lead you to a life of virtue\nand happiness. For nature brought us into the world\nthat we might attain to all excellence of mind, and\nso easy is it for those to learn who seek for better\nthings, that he who directs his gaze aright will\nrather marvel that the bad should be so many. For\nas water is the natural element of fish, dry land\nfor creatures of the earth and the circumambient\natmosphere for winged things, even so it should\nbe easier to live according to nature than counter\nto her will. As regards other accomplishments,\nthere are plenty of years available for their acquisition, even though we measure the life of man not\nby the span of age, but by the period of youth. For\nin every case order and method and a sense of proportion will shorten our labour. But the chief fault\nlies with our teachers, in that they love to keep back\nthe pupils they have managed to lay their hands on,\npartly from the desire to draw their miserable fees\nfor as long as possible, partly out of ostentation, to\nenhance the difficulty of acquiring the knowledge\nwhich they promise to impart, and to some extent\nowing to their ignorance or carelessness in teaching.\nThe next most serious fault lies in ourselves, who\nthink it better to linger over what we have learned\n\n\n\nthan to learn what we do not yet know. For example, to restrict my remarks mainly to the study\nof rhetoric, what is the use of spending so many\nyears, after the fashion now so prevalent (for I will\nsay nothing of those who spend almost their whole\nlives), in declaiming in the schools and devoting so\nmuch labour to the treatment of fictitious themes,\nwhen it would be possible with but slight expenditure\nof time to form some idea of what the true conflicts\nare in which the orator must engage, and of the\nlaws of speaking which he ought to follow? In\nsaying this, I do not for a moment mean to suggest\nthat we should ever omit to exercise ourselves in\nspeaking. I merely urge that we should not grow old\nover one special form of exercise. We have been in a\nposition to acquire varied knowledge, to familiarise\nourselves with the principles that should guide our\nlife, and to try our strength in the courts, while we\nwere still attending the schools. The theory of speaking is of such a nature that it does not demand\nmany years for its acquisition. For any one of the\nvarious branches of knowledge which I have mentioned will, as a rule, be found to be comprised in\na few volumes, a fact which shows that instruction\ndoes not require an indefinite amount of time to be\ndevoted to it. The rest depends entirely on practice,\nwhich at once develops our powers and maintains\nthem, once developed. Knowledge increases day\nby day, and yet how many books is it absolutely\nnecessary to read in our search for its attainment, for\nexamples of facts from the historians or of eloquence\nfrom the orators, or, again, for the opinions of the\nphilosophers and the lawyers, that is to say, if we\nare content to read merely what is useful without\n\n\n\nattempting the impossible task of reading everything? But it is ourselves that make the time for\nstudy short: for how little time we allot to it!\nSome hours are passed in the futile labour of ceremonial calls, others in idle chatter, others in staring\nat the shows of the theatre, and others again in\nfeasting. To this add all the various forms of amusement, the insane attention devoted to the cultivation\nof the body, journeys abroad, visits to the country,\nanxious calculation of loss and gain, the allurements\nof lust, wine-bibbing and those remaining hours\nwhich are all too few to gratify our souls on fire\nwith passion for every kind of pleasure. If all this\ntime were spent on study, life would seem long\nenough and there would be plenty of time for learning, even though we should take the hours of daylight only into our account, without asking any\nassistance from the night, of which no little space\nis superfluous even for the heaviest sleeper. As it\nis, we count not the years which we have given to\nstudy, but the years we have lived. And indeed\neven although geometricians, musicians and grammarians, together with the professors of every other\nbranch of knowledge, spend all their lives, however\nlong, in the study of one single science, it does not\ntherefore follow that we require several lives more\nif we are to learn more. For they do not spend all\ntheir days even to old age in learning these things,\nbut being content to have learned these things and\nnothing more, exhaust their length of years not in\nacquiring, but in imparting knowledge."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.509"}, {"@id": "p.511"}], "#text": "However, to say nothing of Homer, in whom we\nmay find either the perfect achievements, or at\nany rate clear signs of the knowledge of every art,\n\n\n\nand to pass by Hippias of Elis, who not merely\nboasted his knowledge of the liberal arts, but wore\na robe, a ring and shoes, all of which he had made\nwith his own hands, and had trained himself to be\nindependent of external assistance, we accept the\nuniversal tradition of Greece to the effect that\nGorgias, triumphant over all the countless ills incident to extreme old age, would bid his hearers\npropound any questions they pleased for him to\nanswer.

Poetry has risen to the heights\nof glory, thanks to the efforts of poets so far apart\nas Homer and Virgil, and oratory owes its position\nto the genius of Demosthenes and Cicero. Finally,\nwhatever is best in its own sphere must at some\nprevious time have been non-existent. But even if\na man despair of reaching supreme excellence (and\nwhy should he despair, if he have talents, health,\ncapacity and teachers to aid him?), it is none the\nless a fine achievement, as Cicero says, to win the\nrank of second or even third. For even if a soldier\ncannot achieve the glory of Achilles in war, he will\nnot despise fame such as fell to the lot of Ajax and\nDiomede, while those who cannot be Homers may\nbe content to reach the level of Tyrtaeus. Nay, if\nmen had been obsessed by the conviction that it was\nimpossible to surpass the man who had so far shown\nhimself best, those whom we now regard as best\nwould never have reached such distinction, Lucretius\n\n\n\nand Macer would never have been succeeded by\nVirgil, nor Crassus and Hortensius by Cicero, nor\nthey in their turn by those who flourished after\nthem. But even though we cannot hope to surpass\nthe great, it is still a high honour to follow in their\nfootsteps.

The arts\nwhich have been developed to the highest pitch\nof excellence would deserve but ill of mankind if\nthat which was best had also been the last of its\nline.
