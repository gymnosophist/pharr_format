a set of men whose ambition often embroiled the Republic in civil dissensions, and who at last abused their authority to such a degree, that they became instruments of aggrandizement to any leading men in the state who could purchase their friendship.\nIn general, however, the majority of the Tribunes being actuated by views which comprehended the interests of the multitude, rather than those of individuals, they did not so much endanger the liberty, as they interrupted the tranquillity, of the public;

and soon after, they were invested with the authority not only of inspecting the morals of individuals, but of inflicting public censure for any licentiousness of conduct, or violation of decency.\nThus both the civil and religious institutions concurred to restrain the people within the bounds of good order and obedience to the laws;

By the long duration of the late civil war, with its concomitant train of public calami-\nties, the minds of men were become less averse to the prospect of an\nabsolute government; at the same time that the new emperor, naturally\nprudent and politic, had learned from the fate of Julius the art of preserving supreme power, without arrogating to himself any invidious\nmark of distinction. He affected to decline public honours, disclaimed\nevery idea of personal superiority, and in all his behaviour displayed\na degree of moderation which prognosticated the most happy effects,\nin restoring peace and prosperity to the harassed empire. The tenor\nof his future conduct was suitable to this auspicious commencement.\nWhile he endeavoured to conciliate the affections of the people by lending money to those who stood in need of it, at low interest, or without\nany at all, and by the exhibition of public shows, of which the Romans\nwere remarkably fond; he was attentive to the preservation of a becoming dignity in the government, and to the correction of morals.\nThe senate, which, in the time of Sylla, had increased to upwards of\nfour hundred, and, during the civil war, to a thousand, members, by\nthe admission of improper persons, he reduced to six hundred; and\nbeing invested with the ancient office of censor, which had for some\ntime been disused, he exercised an arbitrary but legal authority over the\nconduct of every rank in the state; by which he could degrade senators and knights, and inflict upon all citizens an ignominious sentence\nfor any immoral or indecent behaviour. But nothing contributed more\nto render the new form of government acceptable to the people, than\nthe frequent distribution of corn, and sometimes largesses, amongst the\ncommonalty: for an occasional scarcity of provisions had always been\nthe chief cause of discontents and tumults in the capital. To the interests of the army he likewise paid particular attention. It was by the\nassistance of the legions that he had risen to power; and they were the\nmen who, in the last resort, if such an emergency should ever occur,\ncould alone enable him to preserve it."}, "History relates, that after the overthrow of Antony, Augustus held a\nconsultation with Agrippa and Maecenas about restoring the republican\nform of government; when Agrippa gave his opinion in favour of that\nmeasure, and Maecenas opposed it. The object of this consultation, in\nrespect to its future consequences on society, is perhaps the most important ever agitated in any cabinet, and required, for the mature discussion of it, the whole collective wisdom of the ablest men in the empire.\nBut this was a resource which could scarcely be adopted, either with security to the public quiet, or with unbiassed judgment in the determination of the question.\nThe bare agitation of such a point would have excited immediate and strong anxiety for its final result; while the friends of a republican government, who were still far more numerous than those of the other party, would have strained every nerve to procure a determination in their own favour; and the pretorian guards, the surest protection of Augustus, finding their situation rendered precarious by such an unexpected occurrence, would have readily listened to the secret propositions and intrigues of the republi cans for securing their acquiescence to the decision on the popular side.\nIf, when the subject came into debate, Augustus should be sincere in the declaration to abide by the resolution of the council, it is beyond all doubt, that the restoration of a republican governmeni would have been voted by a great majority of the assembly.\nIf, on the contrary, he should not be sincere, which is the more probable supposition, and should incur the suspicion of practising secretly with members for a decision according to his wish, he would have rendered himself obnoxious to the public odium, and given rise to discontents which might have endangered his future security.", {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7013962", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7010713", "#text": "Actium"}], "#text": "But to submit this important question to the free and unbiassed docision of a numerous assembly, it is probable, neither suited the inclination of Augustus, nor perhaps, in his opinion, consisted with his personal safety.\nWith a view to the attainment of unconstitutional power, he had formerly deserted the cause of the republic when its affairs were in a prosperous situation; and now, when his end was accomplished, there could be little ground to expect, that he should voluntarily relinquish the prize for which he had spilt the best blood of , and contended for so many years.\nEver since the final defeat of Antony in the battle of , he had governed the Roman state with uncontrolled authority; and though there is in the nature of unlimited power an intoxicating quality, injurious both to public and private virtue, yet all history contradicts the supposition of its being endued with any which is unpalatable to the general taste of mankind."}, "There were two chief motives by which Augustus would naturally be influenced in a deliberation on this important subject; namely, the love of power, and the personal danger which he might incur from relinquishing it. Either of these motives might have been a sufficient in\nducement for retaining his authority; but when they both concurred, as they seem to have done upon this occasion, their united force was irresistible.\nThe argument, so far as relates to the love of power, rests upon a ground, concerning the solidity of which, little doubt can be entertained: but it may be proper to inquire, in a few words, into the foundation of that personal danger which he dreaded to incur, on returning to the station of a private citizen.", {"placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7013962", "#text": "Rome"}, "#text": "Augustus, as has been already observed, had formerly sided with the party which had attempted to restore public liberty after the death of Julius Caesar: but he afterwards abandoned the popular cause, and joined in the ambitious plans of Antony and Lepidus to usurp amongst themselves the entire dominion of the state.\nBy this change of conduct, he turned his arms against the supporters of a form of government which he had virtually recognized as the legal constitution of ; and it involved a direct implication of treason against the sacred representatives of that government, the consuls, formally and duly elected.\nUpon such a charge he might be amenable to the capital laws of his country.\nThis, however, was a danger which might be fully obviated, by procuring from the senate and people an act of oblivion, previously to his abdication of the supreme power; and this was a preliminary which doubtless they would have admitted and ratified with unanimous approbation.\nIt therefore appears that he could be exposed to no inevitable danger on this account: but there was another quarter where his person was vulnerable, and where even the laws might not be sufficient to protect him against the efforts of private resentment.\nThe bloody proscription of the Triumvirate no act of amnesty could ever erase from the minds of those who had been deprived by it of their nearest and dearest relations; and amidst the numerous connections of the illustrious men sacrificed on that horrible occasion, there might arise some desperate avenger, whose indelible resentment nothing less would satisfy than the blood of the surviving delinquent.\nThough Augustus, therefore, might not, like his great predecessor, be stabbed in the senate-house, he nmight perish by the sword or the poniard in a less conspicuous situation.\nAfter all, there seems to have been little danger from this quarter likewise; for Sylla, who in the preceding age had been guilty of equal enormities, was permitted, on relinquishing the place of perpetual dictator, to end his days in quiet retirement; and the undisturbed security which Augustus ever afterwards enjoyed, affords sufficient proof, that all apprehension of danger to his person was merely chimerical."}, "We have hitherto considered this grand consultation as it might be\ninfluenced by the passions or prejudices of the emperor: we shall now take a short view of the subject in the light in which it is connected with considerations of a political nature, and with public utility.\nThe arguments handed down by history respecting this consultation are few, and imperfectly delivered;

and, upon the whole, that the interests of the people were more safely entrusted in the hands of annual magistrates elected by themselves, than in those of any individual whose power was permanent, and subject to no legal control.", {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7013962", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,7013962", "#text": "Rome"}], "#text": "In favour of despotic government it might be urged, that though  had subsisted long and gloriously under a republican form of government, yet she had often experienced such violent shocks from popular tumults or the factions of the great, as had threatened her with imminent destruction: that a republican government was only accommodated to a people amongst whom the division of property gave to no class of citizens such a degree of preeminence as might prove dangerous to public freedom: that there was required in that form of political constitution, a simplicity of life and strictness of manners which are never observed to accompany a high degree of public prosperity: that in respect of all these considerations, such a form of government was utterly incompatible with the present circumstances of the Romans: that by the conquest of so many foreign nations, by the lucrative governments of provinces, the spoils of the enemy in war, and the rapine too often practised in time of peace, so great had been the aggrandizement of particular families in the preceding age, that though the form of the ancient constitution should still remain inviolate, the people would no longer live under a free republic, but an aristocratical usurpation, which was always productive of tyranny: that nothing could preserve the commonwealth from becoming a prey to some daring confederacy, but the firm and vigorous administration of one person, invested with the whole executive power of the state, unlimited and uncontrolled: in fine, that as  had been nursed to maturity by the government of six princes successively, so it was only by a similar form of political constitution that she could now be saved from aristocratical tyranny on one hand, or, on the other, from absolute anarchy."}, "On whichever side of the question the force of argument may be thought to preponderate, there is reason to believe that Augustus was guided in his resolution more by inclination and prejudice than by reason.\nIt is related, however, that hesitating between the opposite opinions of his two counsellors, he had recourse to that of Virgil, who joined with Maecenas in advising him to retain the imperial power, as being the form of government most suitable to the circumstances of the times."]}]}, {"@type": "life", "@n": "tib.", "head": {"rs": {"@key": "Tiberius", "#text": "Tiberius"}}, "div2": [{"@type": "chapter", "@n": "1", "p": {"placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,7013962", "#text": "Rome"}, {"@key": "tgn,2072021", "#text": "Romulus"}, {"@key": "tgn,2023439", "#text": "Lucius"}, {"@key": "tgn,2538429", "#text": "Nero"}, {"@key": "tgn,7021127", "#text": "Sabine"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,7013962", "#text": "Rome"}, "#text": "Intramural interments were prohibited at  by the laws of the Twelve Tables, notwithstanding the practice of reducing to ashes the bodies of the dead.

He also winds up the\nnarrative with the following statement: \"They who were present, relate\nboth these cures, even at this time, when there is nothing to be gained\nby lying.\" Both the historians lived within a few years of the occurrence, but their works were not published until advanced periods of\ntheir lives. The closing remark of Tacitus seems to indicate that, at\nleast, he did not entirely discredit the account; and as for Suetonius,\nhis pages are as full of prodigies of all descriptions, related apparently\nin all good faith, as a monkish chronicle of the Middle Ages.\nThe story has the more interest, as it is one of the examples of successful imposture, selected by Hume in his Essay on Miracles; with the\nreply to which by Paley, in his Evidences of Christianity, most readers\nare familiar. The commentators on Suetonius agree with Paley in considering the whole affair as a juggle between the priests, the patients, and,\nprobably, the emperor. But what will, perhaps, strike the reader as\nmost remarkable, is the singular coincidence of the story with the accounts given of several of the miracles of Christ; whence it has been\nsupposed that the scene was planned in imitation of them. It did not\nfall within the scope of Dr. Paley's argument to advert to this; and our\nown brief illustration must be strictly confined within the limits of historical disquisition. Adhering to this principle, we may point out that\nif the idea of plagiarism be accepted, it receives some confirmation from\nthe incident related by our author in a preceding paragraph, forming,\nit may be considered, another scene of the same drama, where we find\nBasilides appearing to Vespasian in the temple of Serapis, under circumstances which cannot fail to remind us of Christ's suddenly standing in the midst of his disciples, \"when the doors were shut.\"  This\nincident, also, has very much the appearance of a parody on the evangelical history. But if the striking similarity of the two narratives be\nthus accounted for, it is remarkable that while the priests of Alexandria,\nor, perhaps, Vespasian himself from his residence in Judaea, were in\npossession of such exact details of two of Christ's miracles -- if not of\na third striking incident in his history -- we should find not the most\ndistant allusion in the works of such cotemporary writers as Tacitus and\nSuetonius, to any one of the still more stupendous occurrences which\nhad recently taken place in a part of the world with which the Romans\nhad now very intimate relations. The character of these authors induces us to hesitate in adopting the notion, that either contempt or\ndisbelief would have led them to pass over such events, as altogether\nunworthy of notice; and the only other inference from their silence is,\nthat they had never heard of them. But as this can scarcely be reconciled with the plagiarism attributed to Vespasian or the Egyptian\npriests, it is safer to conclude that the coincidence, however singular,\nwas merely fortuitous. It may be added that Spartianus, who wrote\nthe lives of Adrian and succeeding emperors, gives an account of a\nsimilar miracle performed by that prince in healing a blind man."}], "#text": "Having, therefore, entered on a civil war, and sent\nforward his generals and forces into , he himself, in\nthe meantime, passed  over to , to obtain possession of the key of .

The murder of Caesar had paralyzed his friends and the people, and for a time placed the power of the state in the hands of the conspirators.\nAntony therefore thought it more prudent to come to terms with the Senate; but meantime he obtained from Calpurnia the papers and private property of Caesar; and by his speech over the body of Caesar and the reading of his will, he so roused the feelings of the people against the murderers, that the latter were obliged to withdraw from the popular wrath.\nAntony, however, seems not to have considered himself strong enough yet to break with the Senate entirely; he accordingly effected a reconciliation with them, and induced them to accept a number of laws, which he alleged were found among Caesar's paperst Antony was now the most powerful man in the state, and seemed likely to obtain the same position that Caesar had occupied.\nBut a new and unexpected rival appeared in young Octavianus, the adopted son and great-nephew of the Dictator, who came from Apollonia to Rome, as. sumed the name of Caesar, and managed to secure equally the goodwill of the Senate and of his uncle's veteran troops.\nA struggle now ensued between Antony and Caesar.\nThe former went to Brindisium, to take the command of the legions which had come from Macedonia; the latter collected an army in Campania.\nTwo of Antony's legions shortly afterwards deserted to Caesar, and Antony, towards the end of\nNovember, proceeded to Cisalpine Gaul, which had been previously granted him by the Senate, and laid siege to Mutina, into which Dec. Brutus had thrown himself. At Rome, meantime, Antony was declared a public enemy, and the conduct of the war against him committed to Caesar and the two consuls, C. Vibius Pansa and A.

Several battles were fought with various success, till at length, in the battle of Mutina (about the 27th of April, 43), Antony was completely defeated, and obliged to cross the Alps. Both the consuls, however, had fallen, and the command now devolved upon Dec. Brutus. In Gaul, Antony was joined by Lepidus with a powerful army, and was soon in a condition to prosecute the war with greater vigour than ever. Meantime, Caesar, who had been slighted by the Senate, and who had never heartily espoused its cause, became reconciled to Antony, through the mediation of Lepidus, and thus the celebrated triumvirate was formed in the autumn of this year (43).

Yet Suetonius, in his life of Augustus, confirms the account of Dion Cassius so far as that some such consultation took place; and the tenor of the speech perfectly agrees with the known character and sentiments of Maecenas.\nIf, therefore, we should be disposed to regard the part here attributed by Dion Cassius to Agrippa and Maecenas as something more than a mere fiction of the historian, for the purpose of stating the most popular arguments that might be advanced against, or in favor of, the establishment of the empire, the most probable solution is that the substance of the speech was extant in the Roman archives in the shape of a state paper or minute, drawn up by Maecenas.\nHowever that may be, the document is certainly a very able one, and should be carefully consulted by all who are studying the history of Rome during its transition from a republic to an empire.", {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "#text": "The stadium, a Greek and Roman measure, was equal to 600 Greek\nor 625 Roman feet, or to 125 Roman paces, and the Roman mile contained 8 stadia.

In recent time,, and by some German authors, especially the celebrated Wieland, Maecenas's claims to the title of a literary patron have been depreciated.\nIt is urged that he is not mentioned by Ovid and Tibullus; that the Sabine farm which he gave to Horace was not so very large; that his conduct was perhaps not altogether disinterested, and\nthat he might have befriended literary men either out of vanity or from political motives; that he was not singular in his literary patronage, which was a fashion amongst the eminent Romans of the day, as Messalla Corvinus, Asinius Pollio, and others; and that he was too knowing in pearls and beryls to be a competent judge of the higher works ot genius.\nAs for his motives, or the reasons why he did not adopt Tlbullis and Ovid, we shall only remark that, as they are utterly unknown to us, so it is only fair to put the most liberal construction on them; and that he had naturally a love of literature for its own sake, apart from all political or interested views, may be inferred from the fact of his having been himself a voluminous author.\nThough literary patronage may have been the fashion of the day, it would be difficult to point out any contemporary Roman, or indeed any at all, who indulged it so magnificently.\nHis name had become proverbial for a patron of letters at least as early as the time of Martial; and though the assertion of that author that the poets enriched by the bounty of Maecenas were now not easily to be counted, is not, of course, to be taken literally, it would have been utterly ridiculous had there not been some foundation for it. That he was no bad judge of literary merit is shown by the sort of men whom he patronized-Virgil, Horace, Propertius; besides others, almost their equals in reputation, but whose works are now unfortunately lost, as Varius, Tucca, and others.\nBut as Virgil and Horace were by far the greatest geniuses of the age, so it is certain that they were more beloved by Maecenas, the latter especially, than any of their contemporaries.\nVirgil was indebted to him for the recovery of his farm, which had been appropriated by the soldiery in the division of lands, in ; and it was at the request of Maecenas that he undertook the Georgics, the most finished of all his poems.\nTo Horace he was a still greater benefactor.\nHe not only procured him a pardon for having fought against Octavianus at Philippi, but presented him with the means of comfortable subsistence, a farm in the Sabine country.\nIf the estate was but a moderate one, we learn from Horace himself that the bounty of Maecenas was regulated by his own contented views, and not by his patron's want of generosity.\nNor was this liberality accompanied with any servile and degrading conditions.\nThe poet was at liberty to write or not, as he pleased, and lived in a state of independence creditable alike to himself and to his patron.\nlideed their intimacy was rather that of two familiar friends of equal station, than of the royally-descended and powerful minister of Caesar, with the son of an obscure freedman."}, "Of Maecenas's own literary productions, only a few fragments exist.\nFrom these, however, and from the notices which we find of his writings in ancient authors, we are led to think that we have not suffered any great loss by their destruction; for although a good judge of literary merit in others he does not appear to have been an author of much taste himself.\nIt has been thought that two of his works, of which little more than the titles remain, were tragedies, namely, the Prometheus aad Octavia.\nAn hexameter line supposed to have belonged to an epic poem; another line, thought to have been part of a Galliambic poem, one or two epigrams, and some other fragments, are extant.\nIn prose, he wrote a work on natural history, which Dliny several times alludes to, but which seems to have related chiefly to fishes and gems.\nServius attributes a Symposium to him.\nIf we may trust the same authority, he also composed some memoirs of Augustus, and Horace alludes to at least some project of the kind, but which was probably never carried into execution.\nMaecenas's prose style was affected, unnatural, and often unintelligible, and for these qualities he was derided by Augustus.\nMacrobius has preserved part of a letter of the Emperor's, in which he takes off his minister's way of writing.\nThe author of the dialogue De Causis Corrupta Eloquentia enumerates him among the orators, but stigmatises his affected style by the term calamistros Mfecenatzs.\nQuintilian and Seneca also condemn his style, and the latter author gives a specimen of it which is almost wholly unintelligible.\nYet, he likewise tells us that he would have been very eloquent if he had not been spoiled by his good fortune, and allows him to have possessed an ingenium grande et virile.\nAccording to Dion Cassius, Maecenas first introduced shorthand, and instructed many in the art through his freedman Aquila.\nBy other authors, however, the invention has been attributed to various persons of an earlier date; as to Tiro, Cicero's freedman, to Cicero himself, and even to Enmus.", "But though seemingly in possession of all the means and appliances of enjoyment, Maecenas cannot be said to have been altogether happy in his domestic life.\nWe have already alluded to an intrigue between Augustus and his  ife Terentia; but this was not the only infringement of his domestic peace; Terentia, though exceedingly beautiful, was of a morose and haughty temper, and thence quarrels were continually occurring between the pair.\nYet the natural uxoriousness of Maecenas as constantly prompted him to seek a reconciliation; so that Seneca remarks that he married a wife a thousand times, though he never had more than one.\nHer influence over him was so great, that in spite of his cautious and taciturn temper, he was.\non one occasion, weak enough to confide an important state secret to her, respecting her\nbrother Murena, the conspirator.\nMaecenas himself, however, was probably in some measure to blame for the terms on which he lived with his wife, for he was far from being the pattern of a good husband.\nHis own adulteries were notorious.\nPlutarch relates of him the story of the accommodating husband, Galba, who pretended to be asleep after dinner in order to give him an opportunity with his wife.", "In his way of life Maecenas was addicted to every species of luxury.\nWe find several allusions in the ancient authors to the effeminacy of his\ndress. Instead of girding his tunic above his knees, he suffered it to hang loose about his heels, like a woman's petticoat; and when sitting on the tribunal he kept his head covered with his pallium. Yet, in spite of this softness, he was capable of exerting himself when the occasion required, and of acting with energy and decision. So far was he from wishing to conceal the softness and effeminacy of his manners, that he made a parade of his vices; and during the greatest heat of the civil wars, openly appeared in the public places of Rome with a couple of eunuchs in his train. Je was fond of theatrical entertainments, especially pantomimes; as may be inferred from his patronage of Bathyllus, the celebrated dancer, who was a freedman of his. It has been concluded from  Tacitus that he first introduced that species of representation at Rome; and, with the politic view of keeping the people quiet by amusing them, persuaded Augustus to patronize it. Dion Cassius tells us that he was the first to introduce warm swimming baths at Rome. His love of ointments is tacitly satirized by Augustus, and his passion for gems and precious stones is notorious. According to Pliny, he paid some attention to cookery; and as the same author mentions a book on gardening, which had been dedicated to him by Sabinus Tiro, it has been thought that he was partial to that pursuit.  His tenacious, and indeed unmanly love of life, he has himself painted in some verses preserved by Seneca. It has been conjectured that he belonged to the sect of the Epicureans; but of his philosophical principles nothing certain is known.", "That moderation of character which led him to be content with his equestrian rank, probably arose from the love of ease and luxury which we have described, or it might have been the result of more prudent and political views. As a politician, the principal trait in his character was fidelity to his master, and the main end of all his cares was the consolidation of the empire. But, though he advised the establishment of a despotic monarchy, he was at the same time the advocate of mild and liberal measures.  He recommended Augustus to put no check on the free expression of public opinion; but above all, to avoid that cruelty, which, for so many years, had stained the Roman annals with blood. To the same effect is the.anecdote preserved by Cedrenus, the Byzantine historian; that when'on some occasion Octavianus sat on the tribunal, condemning numbers to death, Maecenas, who was among the by-standers, and could not approach Caesar by reason of the crowd, wrote upon his tablets, \" Rise, hangman I\" (Surge tandem carmfex), and threw them into Caesar's lap, who immediately left the judgment seat.", {"date": {"@value": "-8", "#text": "B. C. 8"}, "#text": "Maecenas appears to have been a constant valetudinarian. If Pliny's statement is to be taken literally, he laboured under a continual fever. According to the same author, he was sleepless during the last three years of his life; and Seneca tells us that he endeavoured to procure that sweet and indispensab'e refreshment, by listening to the sound of distint symphonies. We may infer from  Horace that he was rather hypochondriacal. He died in the consulate of Gallus and Censorinus, , and was buried on the Esquiline. He left no children, and thus by his death his ancient family became extinct. He bequeathed his property to Augustus, and we find that Tiberius afterwards resided in his house.  Though the Emperor treated Maecenas with coldness during the latter years of his life, he sincerely lamented his death, and seems to have sometimes felt the want of so able, so honest, and so faithful a counsellor."}]}}, {"@type": "life", "@n": "drusus", "head": {"rs": {"@key": "Drusus", "#text": "Nero Claudius Drusus"}}, "div2": {"@type": "chapter", "@n": "1", "p": [{"date": {"@value": "-38", "#text": "B.

To this expedition of Drusus may perhaps be referred the naval battle in the Ems mentioned by Strabo, in which the Bructeri were defeated, and the subjugation of the islands on the coast, especially Byrchamis (Borkum). Ferdinand Wachter thinks that the canal of Drusus must have been too great a work to be completed at so early a period, and that Drusus could not have had time to run up the Ems.\nHe supposes that Drusus sailed to the ocean by one of the natural channels of the river, and that the inconvenience he experienced and the geographical knowledge he gained led him to avail himself of the capabilities afforded by the Lacus Flevus for a safer junction with the ocean; that his works on the Rhine were probably begun in this campaign, and were not finished until some years afterwards.\nThe precise nature of those works cannot now be determined.\nThe most probable opinion seems to be, that Drusus dug a canal from the Rhine near Arnheim to the Yssel, near Doesberg (which bears a trace of his name), and that he also widened the bed of the narrow outlet which at that time connected the Lacus Flevus with the ocean.\nThese were his fossa. With regard to his ager or moles, it is supposed that he partly dammed up the south-western arm of the Rhine (the Vahalis or Waal), in order to allow more water to flow into the north-eastern arm, upon which his canal was situated.\nBut this hypothesis as to the situation of the dyke is very doubtful.\nSome modem authors hold that the Yssel ran into the Rhine, and did not run into the Zuydersee, and that the chief work of Drusus consisted in connecting the Yssel with a river that ran from  Zutphen into the Zuydersee.", "He did not tarry long at Rome.\nOn the commencement of spring he returned to Germany, subdued the Usipites, built a bridge over the Lippe, invaded the country of the Sicambri, and passed on through the territory of the Cherusci as far as the Visurgis (Weser).

His open and affable manners contrasted remarkably with\nthe hauteur and reserve of Tiberius; and like his father, Drusus, he was\nsupposed to be an admirer of the ancient republican liberty. Some of\nthe troops interrupted his harangue, by declaring their reidiness to\nplace him at the head of the empire; whereupon, as if contaminated\nby the guilty proposal, he jumped down from the tribunal whence he\nwas speaking, declared that he would rather die than forfeit his allegiance, and was about to plunge his sword into his breast, when his\nattempt was forcibly stayed by the bystanders."}, "It was known that the army of the Upper Rhine (consisting of four\nlegions, the 2d, 13th, 16th, and 14th, which were left in the charge of\nSilius), was tainted with the disaffection of the troops under Caecina,\nand from motives of policy it was thought necessary to comply with the\ndemands of the sold;ers. A council was held, and a feigned letter from\nTiberius was concocted, in which, after twenty years of service, a full\ndischarge was given; and, after sixteen years, an immunity from military tasks, other than the duty of taking part in actions. The legacy\nleft by Augustus to the troops was to be doubled and discharged. To\nsatisfy the requisition of the 2ist and 5th legions, who demanded immediate payment, Germanicus exhausted his own purse, and his friends\nwere equally liberal.

Germanicus sent word to Cacina, that he was coming with a strong force, and would slaughter them indiscriminately, unless they anticipated his purpose by themselves punishing the guilty.\nThis object was accomplished in an effectual, but revolting manner, by a secret nocturnal massacre of the disaffected ringleaders.\nGermanicus entered the camp while it was still reeking with carnage, ordered the corpses to be buried, and shed many teals on witnessing the sad spectacle.\nHis emotion at sight of the result was accompanied by disapprobation of the means, which he designated as more befitting the rudeness of the butcher than the skill of the physician.", "The soldiers were now anxious to be led to the field, that by the wounds they received in battle they might appease the manes of their brethren in arms; and their general was not unwilling to satisfy this desire.\nHe crossed the Rhine, and fell upon the villages of the Marsi, whom he surprised and slaughtered by night, during a festive celebration.\nHe then laid waste the country for fifty miles round, sparing neither age nor sex, levelled to the ground the celebrated temple of Tanfana, and, on his way back to winter-quarters, pushed his troops successfully through the opposing tribes (Bructeri, Tubantes, Usipetes), between the Marsi and the Rhine.", "The intelligence of these proceedings affected Tiberius with mingled feelings-pleasure at the suppression of the mutiny among the German legions, anxiety on account of the indulgences by which it was bought, and the glory and popularity acquired by Germanicus.\nWhile he regarded his nephewand adopted son with suspicion and dislike, he commemorated his services in the Senate in terms of elaborate, but manifestly insincere praise.\nThe Senate, in the absence of Germanicus, and during the continuance of the war, voted that he should have a triumph.", {"date": {"@value": "15", "#text": "A.

L. HALYS denoted Quarte legionis Halys, but this opinion was overthrown without difficulty, because even at that time it was well known that L. is seldom if ever used in inscriptions as an abbreviation of LEGIO; and, secondly, because the fourth legion was entitled Scythica and not Halys.\nIt was then decided that QUARTAE must indicate the fourth daughter of Livius, and that L. HALYS must be the name of her husband; and  ingenious persons endeavoured  to show  that in all probability he was identical with the L. Magius mentioned by Seneca.\nThey also persuaded themselves that Livy, upon his return home, had been installed by his countrymen in the dignified office of priest of the goddess Concord, and had erected this monument within the walls of her sanctuary, marking the place of sepulture of himself and family.\nAccordingly, the Benedictine fathers of the monastery transported the tablet to the vestibule of their chapel, and caused a portrait of Livy to be painted beside it. In , about fifty years after this discovery, in digging the foundations for the erection of new\nbuildings in connection with the monastery, the workmen reached an ancient pavement composed of square bricks cemented with lime.\nThis having been broken through, a leaden coffin became visible, which was found to contain human bones.\nAn old monk declared that this was the very spot above which the tablet had been found, when immediately the cry rose that the remains of Livy had been brought to light, a report which filled the whole city with extravagant joy.\nThe new-found treasure was deposited in the town hall, and to the ancient tablet a modern epitaph was affixed.\nAt a subsequent period a costly monument was added as a further tribute to his memory.\nIn the lapse of time, however, it was perceived, upon comparing the tablet dug up in the monastery of St. Justina, with others of a similar description, that the contractions had been erroneously explained, and consequently the whole tenor of the words misunderstood.\nIt was clearly proved that L. did not stand for Lucius, but for LIBERTUS, and that the principal person named was Titus Livius Halys, freedman of Livia, the fourth daughter of a Titus Livius; that he had, in accordance with the usual custom, adopted the designation of his former master; that he had been a priest of Concord at Padua, an office which it appeared from other records had often been filled by persons in his station, and that he had set up this stone to mark the burying-ground of himself and his kindred.\nNow since the supposition that the skeleton in the leaden coffin was that of the historian rested solely upon the authority of the inscription, when this support was withdrawn, the whole fabric of conjecture fell to the ground, and it became evident that the relics were those of an obscure freedman."}]}}, {"@type": "life", "@n": "pollio", "head": "C.

while those of Virgil, equally precise and important, are embellished with all the dignity of sublime versification.\nThe work is addressed to Macenas, at whose request it appears to have been undertaken.\nIt is divided into four books.\nThe first treats of ploughing; the second, of planting; the third of cattle, horses, sheep, goats, dogs, and of things which are hurtful to cattle; the fourth is employed on bees, their proper habitations, food, polity, the diseases to which they are liable, and the remedies of them, with the method of making honey, and a variety of other considerations connected with the subject.\nThe Georgics were written at Naples, and employed the author during a period of seven years.\nIt is said that Virgil had concluded the Georgics with a laboured eulogium on his poetical friend Gallus; but the latter incurring about this time the displeasure of Augustus, he was induced to cancel it, and substitute the charming episode of Astaus and Eurydice.", "These beautiful poems, considered merely as didactic, have the justest claim to utility.\nIn what relates to agriculture in particular, the precepts were judiciously adapted to the climate of Italy, and must have conveyed much valuable information to those who were desirous of cultivating that important art, which was held in great honour amongst the Romans.\nThe same remark may be made, with greater latitude of application, in respect of the other subjects.\nBut when we examine the Georgics as poetical compositions, when we attend to the elevated style in which they are written, the beauty of the similes, the emphatic sentiments interspersed, the elegance of diction, the animated strain of the whole, and the harmony of the versification, our admiration is excited at beholding subjects, so common in their nature, embellished with the most magnificent decorations of poetry.", "During four days which Augustus passed at Atella, to refresh himself from fatigue, in his return to Rome, after the battle of Actium, the Georgics, just then finished, were read to him by the author, who was occasionally relieved in the task by his friend Macenas.\nWe may easily conceive the satisfaction enjoyed by the Emperor, at finding that while he himself had been gathering laurels in the achievements of war, another glorious wreath was prepared by the Muses to adorn his temples; and that an intimation was given of his being afterwards celebrated in a work more congenial to the subject of heroic renown.", "It is generally supposed that the Aeneid was written at the particular\ndesire of Augustus, who was ambitious of having the Julian family represented as lineal descendants of the Trojan AEneas. In this celebrated\npoem, Virgil has happily united the characteristics of the Iliad and\nOdyssey, and blended them so judiciously together, that they mutually\ncontribute to the general effect of the whole. By the esteem and sympathy excited for the filial piety and misfortunes of AEneas at the catastrophe of Troy, the reader is strongly interested in his subsequent\nadventures; and every obstacle to the establishment of the Trojans in\nthe promised land of Hesperia produces fresh sensations of increased\nadmiration and attachment. The episodes, characters, and incidents,\nall concur to give beauty and grandeur to the poem. The picture of\nTroy in flames can never be sufficiently admired. The incomparable\nportrait of Priam, in Homer, is admirably accommodated to a different\nsituation, in the character of Anchises, in the AEneid. The prophetic\nrage of the Cumaean Sibyl displays in the strongest colours the enthusiasm of the poet. For sentiment, passion, and interesting description,\nthe episode of Dido is a master-piece in poetry.

To this we must add, that he composed both his poems in a\nsituation of life extremely unfavourable to the cultivation of poetry.\nVirgil, on the contrary, lived at a period when literature had attained\nto a high state of improvement. He had likewise not only the advantage of finding a model in the works of Homer, but of perusing the\nlaws of epic poetry, which had been digested by Aristotle, and the\nvarious observations made on the writings of the Greek bard by critics\nof acuteness and taste; amongst the chief of whom was his friend\nHorace, who remarks that\nE'en sometimes the good Homer naps.\nVirgil, besides, composed his poem in a state remote from indigence,\nwhere he was roused to exertion by the example of several contemporary\npoets; and what must have animated him beyond every other consider\nation, he wrote both at the desire, and under the patronage of the\nEmperor and his minister Maecenas. In what time Homer composed\neither of his poems, we know not; but the AEneid, we are informed,\nwas the employment of Virgil during eleven years. For some years,\nthe repeated entreaties of Augustus could not extort from him the smallest specimen of the work; but at length, when considerably advanced\nin it, he condescended to recite three books-the second, the fourth,\nand the sixth-in the presence of the Emperor and his sister Octavia,\nto gratify the latter of whom, in particular, the recital of the last book\nnow mentioned, was intended. When the poet came to the words, , alluding to Octavia's son, a youth of great hopes, who\nhad lately died, the mother fainted. After she had recovered from this\nfit, by the care of her attendants, she ordered ten sesterces to be given\nto Virgil for every line relating to that subject; a gratuity which\namounted to about two thousand pounds sterling."}, "In the composition of the AEneid, Virgil scrupled not to introduce\nwhole lines of Homer, and of the Latin poet Ennius; many of whose\nsentences he admired.

He maintains the poetic and conventional faith in\nthe gods with decent respect, but with no depth of devotion. There is\nmore sincerity in a sort of vague sense of the providential government to which he attributes his escape from some of the perils of his\nlife, his flight from Philippi, his preservation from a wolf in the Sabine\nwood, and from the falling of a tree in his own grounds.

He playfully alludes to his Epicureanism, but it was practical\nrather than speculative Epicureanism. His mind, indeed, was not in\nthe least speculative. Common life wisdom was his study, and to this\nhe brought a quickness of observation, a sterling common sense, and a\npassionless judgment, which have made his works the delight and the\nunfailing treasure of felicitous quotation to practical men.", "According to Quintilian, Horace was almost the only lyric poet worth\nreading.

We are led to the same conclusion by the fifth elegy of the fourth book, before alluded to, as written during his courtship, which is addressed to Acanthis, a lena, or procuress, who had done all she could to depreciate Propertius and his poems with Cynthia, on account of his want of wealth.\nNor can we draw any other inference from the seventh elegy of the second book, which expresses the alarm felt by the lovers lest they should be separated by the Lex Julia de maritandis ordinibus, and the joy of Cynthia at its not having been passed.\nWhat should have prevented Propertius, then apparently a bachelor, from marrying his mistress? It was because women who had exercised the profession of a courtezan were forbidden by that law to marry an ingenus. There was no other disqualification,\nexcept that libertini were not permitted to marry a man of senatorial dignity.\nSuch an arrangement, or condtio, as that between Propertius and his mistress, did not take place without some previous stipulations, and even solemnities, which the poet has described in the twentieth elegy of the third book, and which he does not hesitate to call satra marita."}, "The precise date and duration of this connection cannot be accurately determined.\nThe seventh elegy of the fourth book seems to show that the lovers were separated only by the death of Cynthia.\nThat Propertius married, probably after Cynthia's death, and left legitimate issue, may be inferred from the Younger Pliny twice mentioning Passienus Paulus a splendidus eques Romanus, as descended from him.\nThe year of Propertius's death is altogether unknown   Masson placed it in B.

Seneca regards both these opinions as founded upon principles inadequate to the advancement both of public and private happiness, which ought ever to be the ultimate object of moral speculation.\nThe last of the author's discourses, addressed to \u00a3Ebucius, is on Benefits, and continued through seven books.\nHe begins with lamenting the frequency of in. gratitude amongst mankind, a vice which he severely censures.\nAfter some preliminary considerations respecting the nature of benefits, he proceeds to show in what manner, and on whom, they ought to be conferred.", "The Epistles of Seneca consist of one hundred and twenty-four, all on moral subjects.\nHis Natural Questions extend through seven books, in which he has collected the hypotheses of Aristotle and other ancient writers.\nThese are followed by a whimsical effusion on the death of Caligula.\nThe remainder of his works comprises seven Persuasive discourses, five books of Controversies, and ten books containing Extracts of Declamations.", "From the multiplicity of Seneca's productions, it is evident that, notwithstanding the luxurious life he is said to have led, he was greatly devoted to literature, a propensity which, it is probable, was confirmed by his banishment during almost eight years in the island of Corsica,\nwhere he was in a great degree secluded from every other resource.\nBut with whatever splendour Seneca's domestic economy may have been supported, it seems highly improbable that he indulged himself in luxurious enjoyment in any vicious excess.\nHis situation at the Roman court, being honourable and important, could not fail of being likewise advantageous, not only from the imperial profusion common at that time, but from many contingent emoluments which his extensive interest and patronage would naturally afford him.\nHe was born of a respectable rank, lived in habits of familiar intercourse with persons of the first distinction, and if, in the course of his attendance upon Nero, he had acquired a large fortune, no blame could justly attach to his conduct in maintaining an elegant hospitality.\nThe Imputation of luxury was thrown upon him from two quarters, viz., by the dissolute companions of Nero, to whom the mention of such an example served as an apology for their own extreme dissipation; and by those who envied him for the affluence and dignity which he had acquired.\nThe charge, however, is supported only by vague assertion, and is discredited by every consideration which ought to have weight in determining the reality of human characters  It seems totally inconsistent with his habits of literary industry, with the virtuous sentiments which he everywhere strenuously maintains, and the esteem with which he was regarded by a numerous acquaintance as a philosopher and a moralist.", "The judgments on Seneca's writings have been as various as the opinions about his character, and both in extremes.\nHis philosophy, so far as he adopted a system, was the stoical, but it was rather an eclecticism of stoicism than pure stoicism.\nHis style is antithetical, and apparently laboured.\nPeople will judge of Seneca, as they do of most moral writers, by the measure of their own opinions.\nThe less a man cares for the practical, the real, the less will he value Seneca.\nThe more a man envelopes himself in words and ideas without exact meaning the less will he comprehend a writer who does not merely deal in words, but has ideas with something to correspond to them.", "Seneca, like other educated Romans, rejected the superstition of his country; he looked upon the ceremonials of religion as a matter of custom and fashion, and nothing more.\nHis religion is simple Deism; the Deity acts in man and in all things, which is the same thing that Paul said when he addressed the Athenians, \" for in him (God) we live, and move, and have our being.\"\nIndeed, there have been persons who, with the help of an active imagination, have made Seneca a Christian, and to have been acquainted with Paul, which is a possible thing, but cannot be proved.", "Besides the works which have been enumerated there are extant ten tragedies, which are attributed to Seneca; Quintilian, and other Latin writers, quote these plays as the works of Seneca.\nThey are entitled, Hercules Furens, Thyestes, Thebais or Phanissae, Hippolytus or Phaedra, Oedipus, Troades or Hecuba, Medea, Agamemnon, Hercules Oetatus, and Octavia.\nThe titles themselves, with the exception of the Octavia, indicate sufficiently what the tragedies are: Greek mythological subjects treated in a peculiar manner.\nThe subject of the Octavia is Nero's ill-treatment of his wife, his passion for Poppaea, and the exile of Octavia.\nSeneca himself is one of the personages of the drama, and he is introduced in the second act, deploring the vices of the age and his own unhappiness in his elevated station.\nThere seems no reason why this tragedy should not be attributed to the same author as the other nine, except the fact that it is not found in the oldest Florentine MS. of the tragedies, nor is there any such difference between this and the other tragedies in character and expression as to make it a probable conclusion that it is not by the same hand.", "These tragedies are not adapted, and certainly were never intended, for the stage.\nThey were designed for reading, or for recitation, after the Roman fashion, and they bear the stamp of a rhetorical age.\nMoral sentiments and maxims abound, and the style and character of Seneca are as conspicuous here as in his prose works.\nBut there is a wonderful difference between the Latin tragic writer and the Greek dramatists.\nThese Roman tragedies are, in fact, little more than dramas in name and in form; the form, indeed, is precisely Greek, but there is no substance under the form.\nThe study of the tragedies of Seneca has had some influence on the French drama."]}}, {"@type": "life", "@n": "petronius", "head": "C.

As the only present suitable to such a prince, he sent him, under a sealed cover, his Satyricon, written purposely against him; and then broke his signet; that it might not, after his death, become the means of accusation against the person in whose custody it should be found.", "The Satyricon of Petronius is one of the most curious productions in the Latin language.\nSome of the scenes, incidents, and characters, are of so extraordinary a nature, that the description of them, without a particular application, must have been regarded as extremely whimsical, and the work, notwithstanding its ingenuity, has been doomed to oblivion: but history justifies the belief, that in the court of Nero, the extravagancies mentioned by Petronius were realized to a degree which authenticates the representation given of them.\nThe inimitable character of Trimalchio, which exhibits a person sunk in the most debauched effeminacy, was drawn for Nero; and we are assured, that there were formerly medals of that emperor, with these words, C. Nero August.\nImp., and on the reverse, Trimalchio.\nThe various characters are well discriminated, and supported with admirable propriety.\nNever was such licentiousness of description united to such delicacy of colouring.\nThe force of the satire consists not in poignancy of sentiment, but in the ridicule which arises from the whimsical, but characteristic and faithful exhibition of the objects introduced.\nThat Nero was struck with the justness of the representation, is evident from the displeasure which he showed, at finding Petronius so well acquainted with his infamous excesses.\nAfter levelling his suspicion on all who could possibly have betrayed him, he at last fixed on a senator's wife, named Silia, who bore a part in his revels, and was an intimate friend of Petronius: upon which she was immediately sent into banishment.\nAmongst the miscellaneous materials in this work, are some pieces of. poetry, written in   \t an elegant taste.\nA poem on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, is beautiful and animated.", {"cit": [{"quote": {"@lang": "la", "l": ["Ecce inter pocula quaerunt", "Romulidae saturi, quid dia poemata narrent."]}, "bibl": {"@n": "Pers. 1.30", "#text": "Persius Sat. i 30"}}, {"quote": {"@lang": "en", "l": ["Nay, more!

explaining not only the fundamental principles of eloquence, as connected with the constitution of the human mind, but pointing out, both by argument and observation, the most successful method of exercising that admirable art, for the accomplishment of its purpose.\nSo minutely, and upon so extensive a plan, has he prosecuted the subject, that he delineates the education suitable to a perfect orator, from the stage of infancy in the cradle, to the consummation of rhetorical fame, in the pursuits of the bar, or those, in general, of any public assembly.\nIt is sufficient to say, that in the execution of this elaborate work, Quintilian has called to the assistance of his own acute and comprehensive understanding, the profound penetration of Aristotle, the exquisite graces of Cicero; all the stores of observation, experience, and practice; and in a word, the whole accumulated exertions of ancient genius on the subject of oratory.", "It may justly be regarded as an extraordinary circumstance in the progress of scientific improvement, that the endowments of a perfect orator were never fully exhibited to the world, until it had become dangerous to exercise them for the important purposes for which they were originally cultivated.\nAnd it is no less remarkable, that, under all the violence and caprice of imperial despotism which the Romans had now experienced, their sensibility to the enjoyment of poetical compositions remained still unabated;

Much of his\nreputation is to be attributed to the belief in his magical or supernatural\npowers, and the parallel which modern and ancient writers have\nattempted to draw between his character and supposed miracles, and\nthose of the author of our religion. His life, by Philostratus, is a mass\nof incongruities and fables.", "Apollonius, according to his biographer, was of noble ancestry, and\nclaimed kindred with the founders of the city of Tyana. At the age of\nfourteen he was placed under the care of Euthydemus, a rhetorician of\nTarsus; but, being disgusted at the luxury of the inhabitants, he\nobtained leave of his father and instructor to retire to the neighbouring\ntown of Aegae. Here he is said to have studied the whole circle of the\nPlatonic, Sceptic, Epicurean, and Peripatetic philosophy, and ended\nby giving his preference to the Pythagorean, in which he had been\ntrained by Euxenus of Heraclea. Immediately, as if the idea of treading in the footsteps of Pythagoras had seized him in his earliest youth, he\nbegan to exercise himself in the severe asceticism of the sect; abstained\nfrom animal food and woollen clothing, foreswore wine and the company of women, suffered his hair to grow, and betook himself to the\ntemple of AEsculapius at AEgae, who was supposed to regard him with\npeculiar favour. He was recalled to Tyana in the twentieth year of his\nage by his father's death; after dividing his inheritance with a brother\nwhom he is said to have reclaimed from dissolute living, and giving\nthe greater part of what remained to his poorer relatives, he returned\nto the discipline of Pythagoras, and for five years preserved the mystic\nsilence, during which alone the secret truths of philosophy were disclosed. At the end of the five years, he travelled in Asia Minor, going\nfrom city to city, and everywhere disputing, like Pythagoras, upon\ndivine rites. There is a blank in his biography, at this period of his\nlife, of about twenty years, during which we must suppose the same\nemployment to have continued, unless, indeed, we have reason to\nsuspect that the received date of his birth has been anticipated twenty\nyears. He was between forty and fifty years old when he set out on\nhis travels to the East, and here Philostratus sends forth his hero on a\nvoyage of discovery, in which we must be content rapidly to follow him.\nFrom  Egae he went to Nineveh, where he met Damis, the future chronicler of his actions, and proceeding on his route to India, he discoursed at Babylon with Bardanes, the Parthian king, and consulted the magi and Brahmins, who were supposed to have imparted to him some theurgic secrets.\nHe next visited Taxila, the capital of Phraortes, an Indian prince, where he met Iarchas, the chief of the Brahmins, and disputed with Indian Gymnosophists already versed in Alexandrian philosophy.", "This eastern journey lasted five years: at its conclusion, he returned to the Ionian cities, where we first hear of his pretensions to miraculous power, founded, as it would seem, on the possession of some divine knowledge derived from the East.\nIf it be true that the honouis of a god were decreed to him at this period of his life, we are of course led to suspect some collusion with the priests, who ale said to have referred the sick to him for relief.\nFrom Ionia he crossed over into Greece, visited the temples and oracles which lay in his way, everywhere disputing about religion, and assuming the authority of a divine legislator.\nAt the Eleusinian mysteries he was rejected as a magician, and did not obtain admission to them until a later period of his life: the same cause excluded him at the cave of Trophonius (from whence he pretended to have obtained the sacred books of Pythagoras, and which he entered by force.\nAfter visiting Lacedzemon, Corinth, and the other towns of Greece, he bent his course towards Rome, and arrived there just after an edict against magicians had been issued by Nero.\nHe was immediately brought before Telesinus the consul, and Tigellinus, the favourite of the Emperor, the first of whom dismissed him, we are told, from the love of philosnphy, and the latter from the fear of a magic power, which could make the letters vanish from the indictment.\nOn his acquittal, he went to Spain, Africa, and Athens, where, on a second application, he was admitted to the mysteries; and from Athens proceeded to Alexandria, where Vespasian, who was maturing his revolt, soon saw the use which might be made of such an ally.\nThe story of their meeting may be genuine, and is certainly curious as exhibiting Apollonlus in the third of the three-fold characters assumed by Pythagoras-philosopher, mystic, and politician.\nVespasian was met at the entrance of the city by a body of magistrates, praefects, and philosophers, and hastily asked whether the Tyanean was among the number.\nBeing told that he was philosophizing in the Serapeum, he proceeded thither, and begged Apollonus to make him emperor: the philosopher replied that \"he had already done so, in praying the god\u00b0 for a just and venerable sover\neign\"; upon which Vespasian declared that he resigned himself entirely into his hands.\nThe last journey of Apollonius was to Ethiopia, whence he returned to settle in the Ionian cities.\nThe same friendship which his father had shown was continued towards him by the Emperor Titus.\nOn the accession of Domitian, Apollonius endeavoured to excite the provinces of Asia Minor against the tyrant.\nAn order was sent to bring him to Rome, which he thought proper to anticipate by voluntarily surrendering himself, to avoid bringing suspicion on his companions.\nOn being conducted into the Emperor's presence, he launched forth into the praise of Nerva, and was hurried to prison, loaded with chains.\nAs destruction seemed impending, it was time to display his miraculous powers: he vanished from his persecutors; and after appearing to Darius at Puteoli at the same hour he disappeared from Rone, he passed over into Greece, where he remained two years, having given out that the Emperor had publicly acquitted him.\nThe last years of his life were probably spent at Ephesus, where he is said to have proclaimed the death of the tyrant Domitian at the instant it took place.\nThree places -- Ephesus, Rhodes, and Crete -- laid claim to the honour of being his last dwelling-place.\nTyana, where a temple was dedicated to him, became henceforth one of the sacred cities, and possessed the privilege of electing its own magistrates.", "However impoasible it maybe to separate truth from falsehood in the narrative of Philostratus, we cannot conceive that a professed history, appealed to as such by contemporary authors, and written about a hundred years after the death of Apollonius himself, should be simply the invention of a writer of romance.\nIt must be allowed, that all the absurd fables of Ctesias, the confused falsehoods of all mythologies, easteln fairy tales, and perhaps a parody of some of the Christian miracles, are all pressed into the service by Philostratus to adorn the life of his hero.\nStill we cannot account for the reception of the narrative by the ancients, and even among the fathers themselves, unless there had been some independent tradition of the character of Apollonius on which it rested.\nEusebius of Caesarea seems to allow the truth of Philostratus's narrative in the main, with the exception of what is miraculous.\nAnd the parody, if it may be so termed, of the life of Pythagoras, may be rather traceable to the impostor himself than to the ingenuity of his biographer.\nStatues and temples still existed in his honour; his letters and supposed writings were extant; the manuscript of his life by Damis the Assyrian was the original work which was dressed out by the rhetoric of Philostratus; and many notices of his visits and acts might be found in the public records of Asiatic cities, which would have at once dis\nproved the history, if inconsistent with it. The conclusion we seem to come to on the whole is, that at a period when there was a general belief in magical powers, Apollonius did attain great influence by pretending to them, and that the history of Philostratus gives a just idea of his character and reputation, however inconsistent in its facts and absurd in its marvels.", "We have purposely omitted the wonders with which Philostratus has garnished his narrative.\nMany of these are curiously coincident with the Christian miracles.\nThe proclamation of the birth of Apollonius to his mother by Proteus, and the incarnation of Proteus himself, the chorus of swans which sang for joy on the occasion, the casting out of devils, raising the dead, and healing the sick, the sudden disappearances and reappearances of Apollonius, his adventures in the cave of Trophonius, and the sacred voice which called him at his death, to which may be added his claim as a teacher having authority to reform the world-cannot fail to suggest the parallel passages in the Gospel history.\nWe know, too, that Apollonius was one among many rivals set up by the Eclectics (as, for instance, by Hierocles of Nicomedia in the time of Diocletian) to our Saviour-an attempt, it may be worth remarking, renewed by the English free-thinkers, Blount and Lord Herbert.\nStill, it must be allowed that the resemblances are very general, -that where Philostratus has borrowed from the Gospel narrative, it is only as he has borrowed from all other wonderful history, and that the idea of a controversial aim is inconsistent with the account which makes the life written by Damis the groundwork of the more recent history.", "The character of Apollonius, as well as the facts of his life, bear a remarkable resemblance to those of Pythagoras, whom he professedly followed.\nTravel, mysticism, and disputation are the three words in which the earlier half of both their lives may be summed up. There can be no doubt that Apollonius pretended to supernatural powers, and was variously regarded by the ancients as a magician and a divine being.\nThe object of his scheme, as far as it can be traced, was twofold-partly philosophical and partly religious.\nAs a philosopher, he is to be considered as one of the middle terms between the Greek and Oriental systems, which he endeavoured to harmonize in the symbolic lore of Pythagoras.\nHis aim was to purify the worship of Paganism from the corruptions which he said the fables of the poets had introduced, and restore the rites of the temples in all their power and meaning.\nIn his works on divination by the stars, and on offerings, he rejects sacrifices as impure in the sight of God.\nIn the miracles attributed\nto him we see the same trace of a Pythagorean character; they are chiefly prophecies, and it is not the power of controlling the laws of nature which Apollonius lays claim to, but rather a wonder-working secret which gives him a deeper insight into them than is possessed by ordinary men.\nUpon the whole, we may place Apollonius midway between the mystic philosopher and the mere impostor, between Pythagoras and Lucian's Alexander; and in this double character he was regarded by the ancients themselves."]}}, {"@type": "life", "@n": "martial", "head": "M.

We know from Dion Cassius that Paris was killed in , upon suspicion of an intrigue with the Empress Domitia.\n2. The fourth satire, as appears from the concluding lines, was written after the death of Domitian, that is, not earlier than . 3. The first satire, as we learn from the forty-ninth line, was written after the condemnation of Marius Priscus, that is, not earlier than A. D. Ioo.\nThese positions admit of no doubt or cavil, and hence it is established that Juvenal was alive at least seventeen years after the death of Paris, and that some of his most spirited productions were written after the death of Domitian.\nHence, if the powerful \" histrio \" in the biography of the pseudo-Suetonius be, as we should naturally conclude, the same person as the Paris named in the preceding sentence, it is impossible that Juvenal could have been banished later than ; it is impossible that he could have died immediately afterwards, since he was alive In A D. ioo; and it Is incredible that if he had pined for a long series of years at a distance from his country, his works should contain no allusion to a destiny so sad, while, on the other hand, they bear the most evident marks of having been conceived and brought forth in the metropolis, amid the scenes so graphically described."}, "Salmasius was much too acute not to perceive this difficulty; but clinging to the idea that Juvenal actually was banished to Egypt at the age of 80 and there died, he endeavoured to escape from the embarrassment by supposing that the seventh satire, containing the lines composed originally against Paris, was not published until the accession of Hadrian; that the word \" histrio \" does not refer to Paris at all, but to some player of that epoch protected by the sovereign, who, taking offence at the passage in question, disgraced the author of what he considered as a scarcely hidden attack upon his abuse of patronage.\nBut although the words both in the satire and in the memoir might, without much violence, be accommodated to some such explanation, yet the hypothesis, taken a, a whole, is so fanciful and so destitute of all external support, that it has been adopted by few scholars.", "Without pretending to embrace the views of this or of any previous critic to their full extent, we may safely assume a sceptical position, and doubt every point which has been usually assumed as true.\nThe only facts with regard to Juvenal upon which we can implicitly rely ale, that he flourished towards the close of the first century, that Aquinum, if not the place of his nativity, was at least his chosen residence, and that he is in all probability the friend whom Martial addresses in three epigrams.", "There is, perhaps, yet another circumstance which we may admit without suspicion.\nWe are told that he occupied himself for many years of his life in declaiming; and assuredly every page in his writings bears evidence to the accuracy of this assertion.\nEach piece is a finished rhetorical essay, energetic, glowing and sonorous; the successive attacks upon vice are all planned with systematic skill; the arguments are marshalled in imposing array; they advance supported by a heavy artillery of powerful and well-aimed illustrations, and sweeping impetuously onward, carry by assault each position as in turn assailed.\nBut although the impression produced at first is overwhelming, the results are not permanent.\nThe different poems are too obviously formal works of art; and while the figures in each picture are selected with anxious care, grouped with all attention to effect, and rich with the most brilliant colouring, the composition as a whole is deficient in the graceful ease and reality which impart such a matchless charm to the less regular and less elaborate sketches of Horace.\nThe means by which the two great satirists seek to achieve their object are as widely different as the tempers and habits of the men  It is impossible to imagine a contrast more striking than is presented by the playful, goodhumoured gaiety with which the one would laugh his hearers out of their follies and their guilt, and by the uncompromising sternness with which the other seeks to scare them, calling to his aid frightful images and terrific denunciations.\nIn the one case, however, we are fully convinced of the absolute sincerity of our monitor; we feel that his precepts are the fruit of long experience, proceeding from one who, having mingled much with the world, and encountered its perils, is filled with kindly sympathies for the difficulties and dangers of those whom he warns to avoid the rocks and shoals on which he had himself well nigh been wrecked, while the stately well-measured indignation of the other belongs to the eloquence of the head rather than of the heart; and the obvious tone of exaggeration which pervades all his thundering invectives leaves us in doubt how far this sustained passion is real, and how far assumed for show.\nBut while the austere and misanthropic gloom of Juvenal touches less deeply than the warm-hearted social spirit of his rival, we must not forget the difference of their position.\nHorace might look with admiration upon the high intellect of his prince, and the generous protection extended by him to literature, and he might feel grateful to the prudent firmness which had restored peace after long years of civil bloodshed, while a decent show of freedom was still left.\nBut the lapse of half a century had wrought a fearful change.\nGalling to the proud spirit filled with recollections of ancestral glory, must have been the chains with which the coarse tyranny of Nero and Domitian ostentatiously loaded their dependents; deep must have been the humiliation of the moralist who beheld the utter degradation and corruption of his countrymen: the canker was perchance too deeply seated even for the keenest knife, but delicate and gentle palliatives would have been worse than mockery.", "The extant works of Juvenal consist of 16 satires, the last being a fragment of very doubtful authenticity, all composed in heroic hexameters and divided in several MSS.\ninto five books, an arrangement which, although as old as the time of Priscian, is altogether arbitrary and unmeaning."]}}, {"@type": "life", "@n": "frontinus", "head": "Sex.
