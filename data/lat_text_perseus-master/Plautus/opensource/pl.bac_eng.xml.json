Hardly in their youth can beardless actors, or mimics with their beards plucked out, find room upon the stage. Why comes forth this aged and lethargic go-between, who is borne upon the ass's back? Listen, I pray, and give me your attention, while I tell you the name of this quiet Comedy. 'Tis proper for you to make silence for a Divinity. It befits not those to use the resources of the voice, who come here not to exclaim, but to be spectators. Give me attentive ears; but not into my hands I mean; I wish my voice, as it flies, to strike these vacant ears. What do you fear? Are those blows more hurtful which open what is shut, or which close what is open? You're very kind; the inhabitants of heaven do love you deservedly. There is profound silence--even the children are still--and now, attend to a new-come messenger, on a new errand. Who I am--why I am come to you--I'll tell you in a few words; at the same time, I'll disclose to you the name of this Comedy. Now, behold, I shall tell you what you wish to know; do you then give me your attention. I am a God of Nature, the foster-father of most mighty Bromius, him who, with a female army, gained a kingdom. Whatever about him renowned nations relate, some part, at least, has been accomplished by my advice. That which pleases me is never displeasing to him. 'Tis right if one father another father does obey. Ass-borne do the Ionian multitudes style me, because I am borne on an ass for my conveyance. Who I am, you understand: if you understand, allow me now to tell the name of this quiet play; at the same time, you may learn why I have come to you. Philemon formerly produced a play in Greek; this, those who speak the Greek language call \"Evantides;\" Plautus, who speaks the Latin, calls it \"Bacchides.\" 'Tis not to be wondered, then, if hither I have come.  sends to you the Bacchides--the Bacchanalian Bacchanals. I am bringing them unto you. What! Have I told a lie? It don't become a God to tell a lie; but the truth I tell--I bring not them; but the salacious ass, wearied with its journey, is bringing to you three, if I remember right. One you behold; see now, what on my lips I bring--to wit, two Samian sisters, Bacchanalians, merry Courtesans, born of the same parents, at one time, at a twin-birth; not less alike than milk to milk, if you compare it, or water to water; were you to see them you would think them halved; so much would you confuse your sight, that you would not be able to distinguish which was which. What remains you long to hear. Now give attention: the story of this Play I will disclose. What country  is, is known to all; for seas, lands, mountains, and islands, have your legions made easy of access. There, Sostrata bore to her husband, Pyrgoteles Pyrocles, twin daughters at one birth; and it pleased them, being initiated at the triennial festival of Bacchus, to call after his name the damsels of which they were the parents. The parents, as often happens, gave a turn to their future fortunes. A Captain carried one of them with him to . The other of the twins sailed for . As soon as Mnesilochus, the son of Nicobulus, beheld her, he began to love her, and frequently paid her visits. Meantime, his father sent the youth to , to bring back thence some gold, which he himself, some time before, had deposited with Archidemides, an ancient friend of his, an aged Phnician. When, for two years he had stayed at , he received the sad news that Bacchis was gone from , for some sailors of his acquaintance sent him word that she had set sail. On this, he writes a letter to Pistoclerus, his only friend, the son of Philoxenus, entreating him to seek the fugitive with care and earnestness. While Pistoclerus is devoting his services to his friend, the twin-sisters, who have just returned to , arouse a passion in the seeker. The one wins Pistoclerus for herself; the other longs for the coming of Mnesilochus. What wonder if two bewitching, merry, pretty Bacchantes, should attract to themselves two unfledged Bacchanalians, and if they should ensnare their decrepit, most aged fathers, fit subjects for the undertaker, bowed down by the weight of their years? But, see, here's Pistoclerus, who is returning to the Bacchides so lately found, and in his simplicity is blowing in himself the sparks of passion so lately kindled. Now I'm off--do you attend."}}}}, {"@type": "act", "@n": "1", "div2": [{"@type": "scene", "@n": "fragments", "milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "line"}, {"@n": "1", "@unit": "TLN line"}], "stage": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "placeName": {"@key": "tgn,1010231", "#text": "Rost"}, "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "Quod si hoc potis est"}, "#text": "The portion from the commencement of this scene down to the beginning of the thirty-fifth line, is translated from the fragments of the beginning of the play which have been lately discovered by the research of Ritschel.

Not more decidedly did it fall by the engine of war, than I shall storm my master here, without a fleet, and without an army and so great array of soldiers. I have won, I have taken by storm this gold from his father for my master's son, in his amour. Now, before the old man comes here, I wish to lament until he does come out. O Troy! O my country! O Pergamus! O Priam! old man, you are undone, you, who'll be wretchedly and shockingly choused out of four hundred golden Philippeans. For those tablets, sealed on the one side and on the other, they are not tablets, but the horse which the Greeks sent, of wood. Pistoclerus is the Epeus; from him were these received. Mnesilochus is the Simon left behind. Behold him! not in Achilles' tomb, but on a couch he reclines: he has Bacchis with him; just as the other formerly had the fire with which to give the signal; so now does she inflame himself. I am Ulysses, by whose advice they do these things. Then, the characters which there are written, are the soldiers in this horse, armed and of high courage. So even thus far has the matter prospered with me. This horse, too, will be making his attack, not on a citadel, but on a coffer A ruin, a destruction, a cleaner-out of the old man's gold, will this horse prove this day. To this silly old man of ours, in fact, I give the name of Ilium; the Captain is Menelas; I, Agamemnon; I, too, am Ulysses, the son of Lartes; Mnesilochus is Alexander, who will be the destruction of his father's fortunes; he has borne off the Helen, on whose account I am now carrying on the siege of Ilium. For there I have heard say that Ulysses was both bold and full of mischief, just as I am. I have been detected in my tricks--he, discovered in a beggar's guise, had almost perished, while he was spying out there the doings of the Trojans. Similarly has it happened to myself to-day. I have been bound, but by my devices I have redeemed myself; he, too, preserved himself by artifice. I have heard that there were three destinies attending Troy, which were fatal to it; if the statue should be lost from the citadel; whereas the second was the death of Troilus; the third was when the upper lintel of the Phrygian gate should be demolished. Just so are there three fatalities for this Troy of ours, corresponding with those three; for, first of all, when, a short time since, as I told our old gentleman the lying story about his host, and the gold, and the bark, then, that instant, did I steal the statue from the citadel. And even then two fatalities were remaining, and no further had I taken this city. Afterwards, when I carried the letter to the old man, then I killed my Troilus. When he supposed, just now, that Mnesilochus was with the Captain's wife, from that, with difficulty, did I disengage myself. And that danger do I compare to what they say, how that Ulysses, recognized by Helen, was betrayed to Hecuba. But as, in olden time, by his coaxing arts, he liberated himself from her, and persuaded her to let him go, so I, by my devices, have rescued myself from the danger, and have deceived the old man. Afterwards, I engaged with the blustering Captain, who, unarmed, takes cities with his words, and there I repulsed my man. Then I engaged in fight with the old gentleman; straightway by one lying device did I vanquish him; by one blow, in a moment, did I take the spoils away from him. He now will give the two hundred Philippean pieces to the Captain, which he has promised that he will give.  Now, I have occasion for another two hundred, to be distributed when Ilium is taken, that there may be the usual draught of honeyed wine with which the soldiers may celebrate their triumph. But this Priam is far superior to him of old. Not fifty sons only has he, but four hundred, and all choice ones, without a blemish; all these this day will I cut off at two single blows. Now, if there were any purchaser for this Priam of ours, I would sell the old fellow in the lump, whom I have on sale the moment that J shall have taken the city. But, lo! I see our Priam standing before the door; I'll go and speak to him."}}}, {"@type": "scene", "@n": "10", "milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "line"}, {"@n": "1076", "@unit": "TLN line"}], "stage": "Enter NICOBULUS from his house.", "sp": [{"speaker": "NICOBULUS", "p": "Pray, whose voice is it that sounds near me?"}, {"speaker": "CHRYSALUS", "p": "O Nicobulus!"}, {"speaker": "NICOBULUS", "p": "What's the matter?"}, {"speaker": "CHRYSALUS", "p": "O, capital!"}, {"speaker": "NICOBULUS", "p": "Well, have you done aught of what I sent you upon?"}, {"speaker": "CHRYSALUS", "p": "What--ask you that?
