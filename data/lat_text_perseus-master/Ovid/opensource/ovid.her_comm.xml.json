The Greeks, having in vain applied for redress, determined to right themselves by force of arms. Ulysses, unwilling to embark in this expedition, counterfeited madness; but, being discovered by the artifice of Palamedes, he went with the rest of the Greeks to Troy, where his valor and prudence eminently contributed to the overthrow of that city. The Grecian fleet, in its return, was overtaken by a storm, which widely dispersed the ships. Many of them were driven upon unknown coasts; and the fugitives were involved in severe distress.

This occupation was supposed to be especially pleasing to Minerva, who was regarded in this character as the guardian of female industry and decorum.  The work was mostly carried on by the female slaves, under the supervision of the mistress of the house, who, with her daughters, occasionally took a part in the more tasteful portion of their labors.  The Greeks and Romans supplied themselves from their own looms with the ordinary articles of clothing;  but the finer textile works of scarfs, shawls, carpets, and tapestry were mostly supplied them from the East.  In the earlier ages of Greece and Rome, it was the duty of the matron, assisted by her daughters, to weave clothing for her husband and sons.

From this seemingly small beginning, arose the rape of Helen, the confederacy of the Greeks, the overthrow of Troy, and the dispersion of the victorious fleet, whence so many Grecian colonies were planted in different parts of the world. The story itself was of the following tenor. The gods and goddesses being invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, Discord only was overlooked. The goddess, enraged at the neglect, waited for an opportunity of revenge. With this view, while Jupiter, Juno, Venus, and Pallas, were sitting together, she threw an apple amongst them, on which were written these words; 'Let it be given to the fairest.' Upon this a dispute arose, which of the three goddesses had the best pretension to the prize; for, as it is natural to be partial in our own cause, each maintained that it could belong only to her. Jupiter, unwilling to decide in a matter so nice and intricate, as foreseeing that to whichsoever candidate it was adjudged, he must incur the displeasure of the other two, referred them to the determination of Paris. This youth had been bred up among Priam's shepherds, and was at that time attending the flocks on mount Ida. Thither the goddesses repaired; and, as they were eagerly bent upon the prize, each endeavored to influence his decision by large offers. Juno promised him a kingdom; Pallas, wisdom and prudence; and Venus, the finest woman in the world. Paris gave sentence in favor of Venus, either from a regard to justice, or because her promises best"}, "suited his temper. Soon after, he was acknowleged by Priam; and, being sent ambas-ador to Sparta, was received in a hospitable and friendly manner by Menclaus the king. Being captivated by the beauty of Helen, and having gained her by his artifices and solicitations, he perfidiously carried her off, while her husband Menelaus was in Crete. This gave rise to the Trojan was, and all the memorable events that attended it; in which the gods and goddesses bore so large a share.

He married Deianira, daughter of oeneus, king of aetolia, who had before been betrothed to Achelous; with whom Hercules disputing for her, had the advantage.

Nessus, dying, presented Deianira with a garment dipped in his own blood; assuring her, that it would prevent her husband from wavering in his affections. It was not long before Hercules gave proof of his inconstancy; for, becoming enamored of Iole, the daughter of Eurytus king of oechalia, he applied to her father for permission to espouse her. His suit being rejected, he captured the city, slew the king, and carried off the princess. His passion for her rose to such a degree of extravagance, that at her desire he laid aside his club, lion's skin, and other badges of heroism, and, putting on woman's apparel, was not ashamed to spin among her maids. Deianira, hearing of this degeneracy, and giving credit to the words of the Centaur, sent him the poisoned shirt.

What probably gave rise to this fable was the appearance of these rocks to ships that sail between them; for, in bearing down upon them, while the ship is yet at some distance, they seem to be joined in one: but, as she approaches nearer, they by degrees open; and, when ressels have passed through them, and have proceeded to some distance on the other side, they again seem to run together and unite.

The nymph, ignorant of what had been done against her, came to the fountain, according to custom, to bathe; which she had no sooner entered, than she perceived that from the middle downward she was a monster and an object of horror. Deeply regretting the loss of her former beauty, she threw herself into the neighbouring sea, where she was changed into a rock that afterwards became famous for shipwrecks.

She was of Lesbos; and as she grew up, discovered a great genius for lyric poetry. She seems to have had no great reputation for chastity, even in her youngest years: and is even taxed with an impure and guilty love towards the Lesbian ladies her contemporaries. But at last an unhappy passion for Phaon engrossed her whole soul, and proved the occasion of great calamities to her. He at first returned her passion, but afterwards neglected her. Love, however, had taken too deep root in her heart to be extinguished by this slight. She resolved to find him at all hazards, and made a voyage into Sicily for that purpose. In that island, and on this occasion, she is supposed to have written her hymn to Venus, so justly celebrated and admired. It did not procure her the happiness for which she prayed. Phaon still continued obdurate; and Sappho, raving with passion, resolved to seek the Acarnanian promontory, on the summit of which was a temple sacred to Apollo. In this temple it was usual for despairing lovers to make their vows, and beg the favor and protection of the God. This done, they threw themselves from the precipice into the sea, where they were sometimes taken up alive. Whether the fright they had been in, or the resolution that could push them to so dreadful a remedy, or the bruises which they often received in their fall, banished all the tender sentiments of love, and gave their spirits another turn, it was observed, that those who had taken this leap, never relapsed into that passion. Sappho tried the cure, but perished in the experiment. Besides the hymn to Venus, there is also preserved to us the fragment of another Ode, in no less reputation among the poets and critics. It seems to have been written in the person of a lover sitting by his mistress, and is generally allowed to be the truest picture of one in that situation, that imagination can frame. Plutarch tells us in the famous story of Antiochus, that, being enamored of Stratonice his mother-in-law, and not daring to discover his passion, he pretended to be confined to his bed by sickness. Stratonice was in the room with the amorous prince when the physician"}, "Erasistratus came to visit him; and it is probable that his symptoms were the same with those which Sappho describes of a lover sitting by his mistress in the above Ode; for it is said the physician found out the nature of his distemper by those symptoms of love which he had learned from Sappho's writings. Hence we may conclude that she had a soul made up of love and poetry. As she was one who had felt that passion in all its warmth, so she has described it in all its workings and turns. She is called by ancient authors the Tenth Muse, and, by Plutarch, is compared to Cacus the son of Vulcan, who breathed out nothing but flame. From the character that is given of her works, it may be made a question, whether it is not for the benefit of mankind that they are lost. They were filled with such bewitching ten-derness and rapture, that a perusal of them might have been dangerous.

Hercules was the conqueror, notwithstanding all the artifices of Achelous, who during the fight transformed himself into a variety of shapes, and among others that of a bull; in which form Hercules broke his horns.

His course was full of turnings and windings, for which reason in the combat with Hercules he is said to have changed himself into a serpent. The roaring noise he makes when he overflows his banks, gave rise to the fiction of changing himself into a bull; and perhaps this may be the reason that the ancients painted rivers with horns, and that the poets so often describe rivers under the figure of a bull.
