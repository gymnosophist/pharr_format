Could ye not have spoiled, \n To deck your trophies, haughty Babylon ? \n Why wage campaigns that send no laurels home? \n What lands, what oceans might have been the prize \n Of all the blood thus shed in civil strife! \n Where Titan rises, where night hides the stars, \n 'Neath southern noons with fiery rays aflame, \n Or where keen frost that never yields to spring \n In icy fetters binds the Scythian main: \n Long since barbarian Araxes' stream, \n And all the distant East, and those who know \n (If any such there be) the birth of Nile , \n Had felt our yoke. Then, then, with all the world \n Beneath thee, Rome , if for nefarious war \n Such be thy passion, turn upon thyself: \n Not yet was wanting for thy sword a foe. \n That crumbled houses and half-ruined homes \n Now mark our cities; that the ancient streets \n Scarce hear the footfall of the passer-by; \n That mighty fragments lie beside the walls; \n That hearths are desolate; that far and wide \n Fields thick with bramble and untilled for years \n Demand the labours of the hind in vain: \n All this nor Pyrrhus caused, nor Punic chief, \n Nor sword thrust deep. 'Twas civil strife alone \n That dealt the wound and left the death behind. \n \n Yet if the fates could find no other way\n \n \n For Nero 's coming, nor the gods with ease \n Gain thrones in heaven; and if the Thunderer \n Prevailed not till the giants' war was done, \n We plain no more, ye gods! for such a boon \n All wickedness be welcome and all crime; \n Thronged with our dead be dire Pharsalia 's fields, \n Be Punic ghosts avenged by Roman blood; \n Add, Caesar, to these ills the Mutin toils; \n \n Perusia 's dearth; on Munda's final field \n The shock of battle joined; let Leucas' Cape \n Shatter the routed navies; servile hands \n Unsheath the sword on fiery Etna 's slopes: \n Still Rome is gainer by the civil war. \n Thou, Caesar, art her prize. When thou shalt choose, \n Thy watch relieved, to seek at length the stars, \n All heaven rejoicing; and shalt hold a throne, \n Or else elect to govern Phoebus' car \n And light a subject world that shall not dread \n To owe her brightness to a different Sun; \n All shall concede thy right: do what thou wilt, \n Select thy Godhead, and the central clime \n Whence thou shalt rule the world with power divine. \n And yet the Northern or the Southern Pole \n We pray thee, choose not; but in rays direct \n Vouchsafe thy radiance to thy city Rome . \n Press thou on either side, the universe \n Should lose its equipoise: take thou the midst, \n And weight the scales, and let that part of heaven \n Where Caesar sits be evermore serene \n And smile upon us with unclouded blue. \n Then may all men lay down their arms, and peace \n Through all the nations reign, and shut the gates \n That close the temple of the God of War. \n Be thou my help, to me e'en now divine! \n Let Delphi 's steep her own Apollo guard, \n And Nysa keep her Bacchus, uninvoked. \n \n Rome is my subject and my muse art thou! \n First of such deeds I purpose to unfold \n The causes task immense what drove to arms \n A maddened nation and from all the world \n Struck peace away. \n By envious fate's decrees \n Abide not long the mightiest lords of earth; \n Too great the burden, great shall be the fall. \n Thus Rome o'ergrew her strength. So when that hour, \n The last in all the centuries, shall sound \n The world's disruption, all things shall revert \n To that primaeval chaos, stars on stars \n Shall crash; and fiery meteors from the sky \n Plunge in the ocean. Earth shall then no more \n Front with her bulwark the encroaching sea: \n The moon, indignant at her path oblique, \n Shall drive her chariot 'gainst her brother Sun \n And claim the day for hers; and discord huge \n Shall rend the spheres asunder. On themselves \n The great are dashed: such end the gods have set \n To height of power: nor ever Fortune shares \n With other lands the weapons of her spite \n Against a nation lord of land and sea. \n Thou, Rome , degraded, sold, the common prey \n Of triple despots, of a tyrant rule \n Partnered as ne'er before-thyself art cause \n Of all the ills. Ye chiefs, with greed of power \n Blind, leagued for evil, is your force conjoined \n To hold the world in common as your prize? \n So long as Sea on Earth and Earth on Air \n Lean for support while Titan runs his course, \n And night with day divides an equal sphere, \n No king shall brook his fellow, nor shall rule \n Endure a rival. Search no foreign lands: \n These walls are proof that in their infant days \n A hamlet, not the world, was prize enough \n To cause the shedding of a brothers blood. \n Concord, on discord based, brief time endured, \n Unwelcome to the rivals; and alone \n Crassus delayed the advent of the war. \n Like to the slender neck that separates \n The seas of Graecia: should it be engulfed \n Then would th' Ionian and Aegean mains \n Break each on other : thus when Crassus fell, \n Who held apart the chiefs, in piteous death, \n And stained Assyria's plains with Latian blood, \n Defeat in Parthia loosed the war in Rome . \n More in that victory than ye thought was won, \n Ye sons of Arsaces; your conquered foes \n Took at your hands the rage of civil strife. \n By sword the realm is parted; and the state \n Supreme o'er earth and sea, wide as the world, \n Could not find space for two. For Julia bore, \n Cut off by fate unpitying, the bond \n Of that ill-omened marriage and the pledge \n Of blood united, to the shades below. \n Hadst thou but longer stayed, it had been thine \n To keep the parent and the spouse apart, \n Strike sword from grasp and join the threatening hands; \n As Sabine matrons in the days of old \n Joined in the midst the bridegroom and the sire. \n With thee all trust was buried, and the chiefs \n Could give their courage vent, and rushed to war. \n Lest newer glories triumphs past obscure, \n Late conquered Gaul the bays from pirates won, \n This, Magnus, is thy fear; thy roll of fame, \n Of glorious deeds accomplished for the state \n Allows no equal; nor will Caesar's pride \n A prior rival in his triumphs brook; \n Which had the right 'twere impious to enquire; \n Each for his cause can vouch a judge supreme; \n The victor, heaven: the vanquished, Cato, thee. \n \n Nor were they like to like: the one in years \n Now verging towards decay, in times of peace \n Had unlearned war; but thirsting for applause \n Gave to the people much, and proud of fame \n His former glory cared not to renew, \n But joyed in plaudits of the theatre, \n \n His gift to Rome : his triumphs in the past, \n Himself the shadow of a mighty name. \n As when some oak, in fruitful field sublime, \n \n Adorned with venerable spoils, and gifts \n Of bygone leaders, by its weight to earth \n With feeble roots still clings; its naked arms \n And hollow trunk, though leafless, give a shade; \n And though condemned beneath the tempest's shock \n To speedy fall, amid the sturdier trees \n In sacred grandeur rules the forest still. \n No such repute had Caesar won, nor fame; \n But energy was his that could not rest- \n The only shame he knew was not to win. \n Keen and unvanquished, where revenge or hope \n Might call, resistless would he strike the blow \n With sword unpitying: every victory won \n Reaped to the full; the favour of the gods \n Pressed to the utmost; all that stayed his course \n Aimed at the summit of power, was thrust aside: \n Triumph his joy, though ruin marked his track. \n As parts the clouds a bolt by winds compelled, \n With crack of riven air and crash of worlds, \n And veils the light of day, and on mankind, \n Blasting their vision with its flames oblique, \n Sheds deadly fright; then turning to its home, \n Nought but the air opposing, through its path \n Spreads havoc, and collects its scattered fires.\n \n \n Such were the hidden motives of the chiefs; \n But in the public life the seeds of war \n Their hold had taken, such as are the doom \n Of potent nations: and when fortune poured \n Through Roman gates the booty of a world, \n The curse of luxury, chief bane of states, \n Fell on her sons. Farewell the ancient ways! \n Behold the pomp profuse, the houses decked \n With ornament; their hunger loathed the food \n Of former days; men wore attire for dames \n Scarce fitly fashioned; poverty was scorned, \n Fruitful of warriors; and from all the world \n Came that which ruins nations; while the fields \n Furrowed of yore by great Camillus ' plough, \n Or by the mattock which a Curius held, \n Lost their once narrow bounds, and widening tracts \n By hinds unknown were tilled. No nation this \n To sheathe the sword, with tranquil peace content \n And with her liberties; but prone to ire; \n Crime holding light as though by want compelled: \n Great was the glory in the minds of men, \n Ambition lawful even at point of sword, \n To rise above their country: might their law: \n Decrees were forced from Senate and from Plebs: \n Consul and Tribune broke the laws alike: \n Bought were the fasces, and the people sold \n For gain their favour: bribery's fatal curse \n Stained every yearly contest of the Field. \n Then covetous usury rose, and interest \n Was greedier with the seasons; and all trust \n Was crushed; and many found a boon in war. \n Caesar has crossed the Alps , his mighty soul \n Great tumults pondering and the coming shock. \n Now on the marge of Rubicon , he saw, \n In face most sorrowful and ghostly guise, \n His trembling country's image; huge it seemed \n Through mists of night obscure; and hoary hair \n Streamed from the lofty front with turrets crowned: \n Torn were her locks and naked were her arms. \n Then thus, with broken sighs the Vision spake: \n What seek ye, men of Rome ? and whither hence \n Bear ye my standards? If by right ye come, \n My citizens, stay here; these are the bounds; \n No further dare.' But Caesar's hair was stiff \n With horror as he gazed, and ghastly dread \n Restrained his footsteps on the further bank. \n Then spake he, ' Thunderer, who from the rock \n Tarpeian seest the wall of mighty Rome ; \n Gods of my race who watched o'er Troy of old; \n Thou Jove of Alba's height, and Vestal fires, \n And rites of Romulus erst rapt to heaven, \n And God-like Rome ; be friendly to my quest. \n Not with offence or hostile arms I come, \n Thy Caesar, conqueror by land and sea, \n Thy soldier here and wheresoe'er thou wilt: \n No other's; his, his only be the guilt \n Whose acts make me thy foe.' He gives the word \n And bids his standards cross the swollen stream. \n So in the wastes of Afric's burning clime \n The lion crouches as his foes draw near, \n Feeding his wrath the while, his lashing tail \n Provokes his fury; stiff upon his neck \n Bristles his mane: deep from his gaping jaws \n Resounds the muttered growl, and should a lance \n Or javelin reach him from the hunter's ring, \n Scorning the puny scratch he bounds afield. \n From modest fountain blood-red Rubicon \n \n In summer's heat flows on; his pigmy tide \n Creeps through the valleys and with slender marge \n Divides the Italian peasant from the Gaul . \n Then winter gave him strength, and fraught with rain \n The third day's crescent moon; while Eastern winds \n Thawed from the Alpine slopes the yielding snow. \n The cavalry first form across the stream \n To break the torrent's force; the rest with ease \n Beneath their shelter gain the further bank. \n When Caesar crossed and trod beneath his feet \n The soil of Italy 's forbidden fields, \n Here,' spake he, 'peace, here broken laws be left; \n Farewell to treaties. Fortune, lead me on; \n War is our judge, and in the fates our trust.' \n Then in the shades of night he leads the troops \n Swifter than Balearic sling or shaft \n Winged by retreating Parthian, to the walls \n Of threatened Rimini , while fled the stars, \n Save Lucifer, before the coming sun, \n Whose fires were veiled in clouds, by south wind driven, \n Or else at heaven's command: and thus drew on \n The first dark morning of the civil war. \n Now stood the troops within the captured town, \n Their standards planted; and the trumpet clang \n Rang forth in harsh alarums, giving note \n Of impious strife: roused from their sleep the men \n Rushed to the hall and snatched the ancient arms \n Long hanging through the years of peace; the shield \n With crumbling frame; dark with the tooth of rust \n Their swords; and javelins with blunted point. \n But when the well-known signs and eagles shone, \n And Caesar towering o'er the throng was seen, \n They shook for terror, fear possessed their limbs, \n And thoughts unuttered stirred within their souls. \n O miserable those to whom their home \n Denies the peace that all men else enjoy! \n Placed as we are beside the Northern bounds \n And scarce a footstep from the restless Gaul , \n We fall the first; would that our lot had been \n Beneath the Eastern sky, or frozen North, \n To lead a wandering life, rather than keep \n ' The gates of Latium . Brennus sacked the town \n ' And Hannibal, and all the Teuton hosts. \n ' This is the path when Rome 's the prize of war.' \n Deep in their breasts they breathed the silent moan; \n But dared not speak their sorrow nor their fear. \n As when in winter all the fields are still, \n And birds are voiceless, and no murmured sound \n Breaks on the silence of the central sea; \n So deep the stillness. But when through the shades \n The day had broken, lo! the torch of war! \n For by the hand of Fate is swift dispersed \n All Caesar's shame of battle, and his mind \n Scarce doubted more; and Fortune toiled to make \n His action just and give him cause for arms. \n For while Rome wavered and her patriots' names \n Were loud and frequent in the mouths of men, \n The Senate angered and in scorn of right \n \n Drove out the Tribunes who withstood their will. \n To Caesar's troops already on the march \n They haste with Curio, who in former days \n With bold and venal tongue had dared to speak \n For Freedom, and to voice the people's wrongs, \n And summon to their side the chiefs in arms. \n Who, when he saw that Caesar doubted still, \n Spake out; ' So long as I the rostrum held \n ' By this my voice against the Senate's will \n ' Was thy command prolonged, and to thy side \n ' By me were drawn the wavering men of Rome . \n ' Mute now are laws in war; we from our hearths \n Are driven, yet willing exiles; for thine arms \n Shall make us citizens of Rome again. \n 'Strike; for no strength as yet the foe hath gained. \n 'To pause when ready is to court defeat: \n 'Like risk, like labour, thou hast known before, \n 'But never such reward. Could Gallia hold \n 'Thine armies ten long years ere victory came, \n 'That little nook of earth? One paltry fight \n 'Or twain, fought out by thy resistless hand, \n 'And Rome for thee shall have subdued the world: \n 'Tis true no triumph now would bring thee home; \n 'No captive tribes would grace thy chariot wheels \n 'Winding in pomp around the ancient hill: \n 'Spite, gnawing spite, denies thee all thy due; \n For all thy conquests, for a world well won \n 'Scarce shalt thou go unpunished. Yet 'tis fate \n 'Thou should'st subdue thy kinsman: share the world \n 'With him thou canst not; rule thou canst, alone.'\n \n \n As when at Elis ' festival a horse \n In stable pent gnaws at his prison bars \n Impatient, and should clamour from without \n Strike on his ear, bounds furious at restraint, \n So then was Caesar, eager for the fight, \n Stirred by the words of Curio. To the ranks \n He bids his soldiers; with majestic mien \n And hand commanding silence as they come. \n Comrades,' he cried, ' victorious returned, \n 'Who by my side for ten long years have faced, \n 'Mid Alpine winters and on Arctic shores, \n 'The thousand dangers of the battle-field--- \n Is this our country's welcome, this her prize \n ' For death and wounds and Roman blood outpoured? \n ' Rome arms her choicest sons; the sturdy oaks \n ' Are felled to make a fleet;-what could she more \n ' If from the Alps fierce Hannibal were come \n ' With all his Punic host? \" By land and sea \n ' Caesar shall fly!\" Fly? Though in adverse war \n ' Our best had fallen, and the savage Gaul \n \n ' Were hard upon our track, we would not fly. \n 'And now, when fortune smiles and kindly gods \n ' Beckon us on to glory! -Let him come \n ' Fresh from his years of peace, with all his crowd \n ' Of conscript burgesses, Marcellus' tongue \n \n ' And Cato's empty name! We will not fly. \n ' Shall Eastern hordes and greedy hirelings keep \n ' Their loved Pompeius ever at the helm? \n ' Shall chariots of triumph be for him \n 'Though youth and law forbad them? Shall he seize \n ' On Rome's chief honours ne'er to be resigned? \n ' And what of harvests blighted through the world \n ' And ghastly famine made to serve his ends? \n ' Who hath forgotten how Pompeius' bands \n ' Seized on the forum? the grim sheen of swords \n ' When outraged justice trembled, and the spears \n ' Hemmed in the judgment-seat where Milo \n stood? \n ' And now when worn and old and ripe for rest, \n \n ' Greedy of power, the impious sword again \n ' He draws. As tigers in Hyrcanian woods \n ' Wandering, or in the caves that saw their birth, \n ' Once having lapped the blood of slaughtered kine, \n ' Shall never cease from rage; e'en so this whelp \n ' Of cruel Sulla, nursed in civil war, \n ' Outstrips his master; and the tongue which licked \n ' That reeking weapon ever thirsts for more. \n ' Stain once the lips with blood, no other meal \n ' They shall enjoy. And shall there be no end \n ' Of these long years of power and of crime? \n ' Nay, this one lesson, ere it be too late, \n ' Learn of thy gentle Sulla-to retire! \n ' Of old his victory o'er Cilician thieves \n ' And Pontus' weary monarch gave him fame, \n ' By poison scarce attained. His latest prize \n ' Shall I be, Caesar, I, who would not quit \n ' My conquering eagles at his proud command? \n ' Nay, if no triumph is reserved for me, \n ' Let these at least of long and toilsome war \n ''Neath other leaders the rewards enjoy. \n ' Where shall the weary soldier find his rest? \n ' What cottage homes their joys, what fields their fruit \n ' Shall to our veterans yield? Will Magnus say \n ' That pirates only till the fields aright? \n ' Unfurl your standards; victory gilds them yet, \n ' As through those glorious years. Deny our rights! \n ' He that denies them makes our quarrel just. \n ' Nay! use the strength that we have made our own. \n ' No booty seek we, nor imperial power. \n ' This would-be ruler of subservient Rome \n \n 'We force to quit his grasp; and Heaven shall smile \n 'On those who seek to drag the tyrant down.' \n Thus Caesar spake; but doubtful murmurs ran \n Throughout the crowd; their household gods and homes \n Made pause their minds though long inured to blood: \n But fear of Caesar and the pride of war \n Drew them to him. Then Laelius, who wore \n The well-earned crown for Roman life preserved, \n The foremost Captain of the army, spake: \n 'O greatest leader of the Roman name, \n 'If thou dost ask it, and the law permits, \n 'I tell thee all: our just complaint is this, \n 'That gifted with such strength thou didst refrain \n 'From using it. Hadst thou no trust in us? \n 'While the hot life-blood fills these glowing veins, \n ' While these strong arms avail to hurl the lance, \n 'Wilt thou in peace endure the Senate's rule? \n 'Is civil conquest then so base and vile? \n 'Lead us through Scythian deserts, lead us where \n 'The inhospitable Syrtes line the shore \n 'Of Afric's burning sands, or where thou wilt: \n 'This hand, to leave a conquered world behind, \n 'Held firm the oar that tamed the Northern Sea \n And Rhine 's swift torrent foaming to the main. \n 'To follow thee fate gives me now the power: \n 'The will was mine before. No citizen \n 'I count the man 'gainst whom thy trumpets sound. \n 'By ten campaigns of victory, I swear, \n 'By all thy triumphs, bid me plunge the sword \n 'In sire or brother or in pregnant spouse, \n By this unwilling hand the deed were done: \n 'Bid spoil the gods and set the fanes ablaze, \n Great Juno's shrine were kindled with our fires; \n 'Bid plant our arms o'er Tuscan Tiber's stream, \n 'Italian land I'll quarter for the camp: \n 'Bid raze the wall, I'll drive the fatal ram \n 'And rive the stones asunder, though the prize \n ' Were Rome herself.' His comrades lift their hands \n And vow to follow wheresoever he leads. \n And such a clamour rends the sky as when \n Some Thracian blast on Ossa's pine-clad rocks \n Falls headlong, and the loud re-echoing woods, \n Or bending, or rebounding from the stroke, \n In sounding chorus lift the roar on high. \n When Caesar saw them welcome thus the war \n And Fortune leading on, and favouring fates, \n He seized the moment, called his troops from Gaul , \n And breaking up his camp set on for Rome .\n \n \n The tents are vacant by Lake Leman's side; \n The camps upon the beetling crags of Vosges \n \n No longer hold the warlike Lingon down, \n Fierce in his painted arms; Isere is left, \n Who past his shallows gliding, flows at last \n Into the current of more famous Rhone , \n To reach the ocean in another name. \n The fair-haired people of Cevennes are free: \n Soft Aude rejoicing bears no Roman keel, \n Nor pleasant Var, since then Italia 's bound; \n The harbour sacred to Alcides' name \n Where hollow crags encroach upon the sea, \n Is left in freedom: there nor Zephyr gains \n Nor Caurus access, but the Circian blast \n Forbids the roadstead by Monaecus' hold. \n Left is the doubtful shore, which the vast sea \n And land alternate claim, whene'er the tide \n Pours in amain or when the wave rolls back \n Be it the wind which thus compels the deep \n From furthest pole, and leaves it at the flood; \n Or else the moon that makes the tide to swell, \n Or else, in search of fuel for his fires, \n The sun draws heavenward the ocean wave; - \n Whatever the cause that may control the main \n I leave to others; let the gods for me \n Lock in their breasts the secrets of the world. \n Those who keep watch beside the western shore \n Have moved their standards home; the happy Gaul \n \n Rejoices in their absence; fair Garonne \n \n Through peaceful meads glides onward to the sea. \n And where the river broadens, neath the cape \n Her quiet harbour sleeps. No outstretched arm \n Except in mimic war now hurls the lance. \n No skilful warrior of Seine directs \n The chariot scythed against his country's foe. \n Now rest the Belgians, and th' Arvernian race \n That boasts our kinship by descent from Troy ; \n And those brave rebels whose undaunted hands \n Were dipped in Cotta's blood, and those who wear \n Sarmatian garb. Batavia 's warriors fierce \n No longer listen for the trumpet's call, \n Nor those who dwell where Rhone 's swift eddies sweep \n \n Saone to the ocean; nor the mountain tribes \n Who dwell about its source. Thou, too, oh Treves , \n Rejoicest that the war has left thy bounds. \n Ligurian tribes, now shorn, in ancient days \n First of the long-haired nations, on whose necks \n Once flowed the auburn locks in pride supreme; \n And those who pacify with blood accursed \n Savage Teutates, Hesus' horrid shrines, \n And Taranis' altars, cruel as were those \n Loved by Diana, goddess of the north; \n All these now rest in peace. And you, ye Bards, \n Whose martial lays send down to distant times \n The fame of valorous deeds in battle done, \n Pour forth in safety more abundant song. \n While you, ye Druids, when the war was done, \n To mysteries strange and hateful rites returned: \n To you alone 'tis given the heavenly gods \n To know or not to know; secluded groves \n Your dwelling-place, and forests far remote. \n If what ye sing be true, the shades of men \n Seek not the dismal homes of Erebus \n Or death's pale kingdoms; but the breath of life \n Still rules these bodies in another age- \n Life on this hand and that, and death between. \n Happy the peoples 'neath the Northern Star \n In this their false belief; for them no fear \n Of that which frights all others: they with hands \n And hearts undaunted rush upon the foe \n And scorn to spare the life that shall return. \n Ye too depart who kept the banks of Rhine \n \n Safe from the foe, and leave the Teuton tribes \n Free at their will to march upon the world. \n When strength increased gave hope of greater deeds \n Caesar dispersed throughout Italia 's bounds \n His countless bands, and filled the neighbouring towns. \n Then empty rumour to well-grounded fear \n Gave strength, and heralding the coming war \n In hundred voices 'midst the people spread. \n One cries in terror, ' Swift the squadrons come \n ' Where Nar with Tiber joins: and where, in meads \n 'By oxen loved, Mevania spreads her walls, \n 'Fierce Caesar hurries his barbarian horse. \n ' With all his eagles and his standards joined \n 'He leads the throng that sweeps along the land.' \n Nor as they knew him do they paint the chief, \n But stronger than the truth, and pitiless \n And fiercer far-as from his conquered foes \n Advancing; in his rear the peoples march, \n Snatched from their homes between the Rhine and Alps , \n To sack the city while her sons look on. \n Thus each man's panic thought swells rumour's lie: \n They fear the phantoms they themselves create. \n Nor did the terror seize the crowd alone: \n But fled the Fathers, to the Consuls first \n Issuing their hated order, as for war; \n And doubting of the peril, doubting too \n Where safety lay, through all the choking gates \n In dense array they urged the people forth. \n Thou wouldst believe that blazing to the torch \n Were men's abodes, or nodding to their fall. \n So streamed they onwards, frenzied with affright, \n As though in exile only could they find \n Hope for their country. So, when southern blasts \n From Libyan whirlpools drive the boundless main, \n And mast and sail crash down upon a ship \n With ponderous weight, but still the frame is sound, \n Her crew and captain leap into the sea, \n Each making shipwreck for himself. 'Twas thus \n They passed the city gates and fled to war. \n No aged parent now could stay his son; \n Nor wife her spouse, nor did they pray the gods \n To grant the safety of their fatherland. \n None linger on the threshold for a look \n Of their loved city, though perchance the last. \n Ye gods, who lavish priceless gifts on men, \n Nor care to guard them given! thus was Rome \n \n Teeming with conquered nations, whose vast walls \n Had compassed all mankind, by coward hands \n To coming Caesar left an easy prey. \n The Roman soldier, when in foreign lands \n Pressed by the enemy, in narrow trench \n And hurried mound finds guard enough to make \n His tented sleep secure: thou Rome alone \n Upon the rumour of advancing war \n Art left a desert, and thy battlements \n Not trusted for a night. Yet for their fear \n This one excuse was left; Pompeius fled.\n \n \n Nor found they room for hope; for nature gave \n Unerring portents of worse ills to come. \n The angry gods filled earth and air and sea \n With frequent prodigies; in darkest nights \n Strange constellations sparkled through the gloom: \n The pole was all afire, and torches flew \n Across the depths of heaven; with horrid hair \n A blazing comet stretched from east to west \n And threatened change to kingdoms. From the blue \n Pale lightning flashed, and in the murky air \n The fire took divers shapes; a lance afar \n Would seem to quiver or a misty torch; \n A noiseless thunderbolt from cloudless sky \n Rushed down, and drawing fire in northern parts \n Plunged on the summit of the Alban mount. \n The stars that run their courses in the void \n Of night, came forth at noontide, and the moon \n Whose orb complete gave back her brother's rays, \n Hid by the shade of earth, grew pale and wan. \n The sun himself, when poised in mid career, \n Shrouded his burning car in blackest gloom \n And plunged the world in darkness, so that men \n Despaired of day-like as he veiled his light \n From that fell banquet which Mycenae saw. \n The jaws of Etna were agape with flame \n That rose not heavenwards, but headlong fell \n In smoking stream upon th' Italian flank. \n Then black Charybdis, from her boundless depth, \n Threw up a gory sea. In piteous tones \n Howled the wild dogs; the Vestal fire was snatched \n From off the altar; and the flame that crowned \n The Latin festival was split in twain, \n As on the Theban pyre, in ancient days; \n Earth tottered on its base: the mighty Alps \n \n From off their summits shook th' eternal snow. \n \n In huge upheaval Ocean raised his waves \n O'er Calpe's rock and Atlas' hoary head. \n The native gods shed tears, and holy sweat \n Dropped from the idols; gifts in temples fell: \n Foul birds defiled the day; beasts left the woods \n And made their lair among the streets of Rome . \n All this we hear; nay more: dumb oxen spake; \n Monsters were brought to birth and mothers shrieked \n At their own offspring; words of dire import \n From Cumae 's prophetess were noised abroad. \n \n Bellona 's priests with bleeding arms, and slaves \n Of Cybele's worship, with ensanguined hair, \n Howled chants of havoc and of woe to men. \n Arms clashed; and sounding in the pathless woods \n Were heard strange voices; spirits walked the earth: \n And dead men's ashes muttered from the urn. \n Those who live near the walls desert their homes, \n For lo! with hissing serpents in her hair, \n Waving in downward whirl a blazing pine, \n A fiend patrols the town, like that which erst \n At Thebes urged on Agave, or which hurled \n Lycurgus' bolts, or that which as he came \n From Hades seen, at haughty Juno's word, \n Brought terror to the soul of Hercules. \n Trumpets like those that summon armies forth \n Were heard re-echoing in the silent night: \n And from the earth arising Sulla's ghost \n Sang gloomy oracles, and by Anio's wave \n All fled the homesteads, frighted by the shade \n Of Marius waking from his broken tomb. \n In such dismay they summon, as of yore, \n The Tuscan sages to the nation's aid. \n Aruns, the eldest, leaving his abode \n In desolate Luca , came, well versed in all \n The lore of omens; knowing what may mean \n The flight of hovering bird, the pulse that beats \n In offered victims, and the levin bolt. \n All monsters first, by most unnatural birth \n Brought into being, in accursed flames \n He bids consume. Then round the walls of Rome \n \n \n Each trembling citizen in turn proceeds. \n The priests, chief guardians of the public faith, \n With holy sprinkling purge the open space \n That borders on the wall; in sacred garb \n Follows the lesser crowd: the Vestals come \n By priestess led with laurel crown bedecked, \n To whom alone is given the right to see \n Minerva's effigy that came from Troy . \n \n Next come the keepers of the sacred books \n And fate's predictions; who from Almo's brook \n Bring back Cybebe laved; the augur too \n Taught to observe sinister flight of birds; \n And those who serve the banquets to the gods; \n And Titian brethren; and the priest of Mars, \n Proud of the buckler that adorns his neck; \n By him the Flamen, on his noble head \n The cap of office. While they tread the path \n That winds around the walls, the aged seer \n Collects the thunderbolts that fell from heaven, \n And lays them deep in earth, with muttered words \n Naming the spot accursed. Next a steer, \n Picked for his swelling neck and beauteous form, \n He leads to the altar, and with slanting knife \n Spreads on his brow the meal, and pours the wine. \n The victim's struggles prove the gods averse; \n But when the servers press upon his horns \n He bends the knee and yields him to the blow. \n No crimson torrent issues at the stroke, \n But from the wound a dark empoisoned stream \n Ebbs slowly downward. Aruns at the sight \n Aghast, upon the entrails of the beast \n Essayed to read the anger of the gods. \n Their very colour terrified the seer; \n Spotted they were and pale, with sable streaks \n Of lukewarm gore bespread; the liver damp \n With foul disease, and on the hostile part \n The angry veins defiant; of the lungs \n The fibre hid, and through the vital parts \n The membrane small; the heart has ceased to throb; \n Blood oozes through the ducts; the caul is split: \n And, fatal omen of impending ill, \n One lobe o'ergrows the other; of the twain \n The one lies flat and sick, the other beats \n And keeps the pulse in rapid strokes astir. \n Disaster's near approach thus learned, he cries- \n ' Whatever may be the purpose of the gods, \n ' Tis not for me to tell; this offered beast \n ' Not Jove possesses, but the gods below. \n ' We dare not speak our fears, yet fear doth make \n ' The future worse than fact. May all the gods \n ' Prosper the tokens, and the sacrifice \n ' Be void of truth, and Tages (famous seer) \n \n ' Have vainly taught these mysteries.' Such his words \n Involved, mysterious.\n \n \n Figulus, to whom \n For knowledge of the secret depths of space \n And laws harmonious that guide the stars \n \n Memphis could find no peer, then spake at large: \n ' Either,' he said, ' the world and countless orbs \n ' Throughout the ages wander at their will; \n ' Or, if the fates control them, ruin huge \n ' Hangs o'er this city and o'er all mankind. \n ' Shall Earth yawn open and engulph the towns? \n ' Shall scorching heat usurp the temperate air \n ' And fields refuse their timely fruit? The streams \n ' Flow mixed with poison? In what plague, ye gods, \n 'In what destruction shall ye wreak your ire? \n 'Whate'er the truth, the days in which we live \n ' Shall find a doom for many. Had the star \n ' Of baleful Saturn, frigid in the height, \n ' Kindled his lurid fires, the sky had poured \n 'Its torrents forth as in Deucalion's time, \n ' And whelmed the world in waters. Or if thou, \n ' Phoebus, beside the Nemean lion fierce \n ' Wert driving now thy chariot, flames should seize \n 'The universe and set the air ablaze. \n ' These are at peace; but, Mars, why art thou bent \n ' On kindling thus the Scorpion, his tail \n ' Portending evil and his claws aflame? \n ' Deep sunk is kindly Jupiter , and dull \n ' Sweet Venus' star, and rapid Mercury \n ' Stays on his course: Mars only holds the sky. \n 'Why does Orion's sword too brightly shine? \n ' Why planets leave their paths and through the void \n 'Thus journey on obscure? Tis war that comes, \n ' Fierce rabid war: the sword shall bear the rule \n ' Confounding justice; hateful crime usurp \n ' The name of virtue; and the havoc spread \n ' Through many a year. But why entreat the gods? \n ' The end Rome longs for and the final peace \n 'Comes with a despot. Draw thou out thy chain \n 'Of lengthening slaughter, and (for such thy fate) \n ' Make good thy liberty through civil war.' \n The frightened people heard, and as they heard \n His words prophetic made them fear the more. \n But worse remained; for as on Pindus' slopes \n Possessed with fury from the Theban god \n Speeds some Bacchante, thus in Roman streets \n Behold a matron run, who, in her trance, \n Relieves her bosom of the god within. \n ' Where dost thou snatch me, Paean, to what shore \n 'Through airy regions borne? I see the snows \n 'Of Thracian mountains; and Philippi 's plains \n 'Lie broad beneath. But why these battle lines, \n 'No foe to vanquish- Rome on either hand? \n 'Again I wander 'neath the rosy hues \n 'That paint thine eastern skies, where regal Nile \n \n 'Meets with his flowing wave the rising tide. \n 'Known to mine eyes that mutilated trunk \n ' That lies upon the sand! Across the seas \n 'By changing whirlpools to the burning climes \n 'Of Libya borne, again I see the hosts \n 'From Thracia brought by fate's command. And now \n 'Thou bear'st me o'er the cloud-compelling Alps \n \n 'And Pyrenean summits; next to Rome . \n 'There in mid-Senate see the closing scene \n 'Of this foul war in foulest murder done. \n 'Again the factions rise; through all the world \n Once more I pass; but give me some new land, \n 'Some other region, Phoebus, to behold \n 'Washed by the Pontic billows! for these eyes \n 'Already once have seen Philippi 's plains! ' \n \n The frenzy left her and she speechless fell.\n \n "

            "0":"\n THUS was made plain the anger of the gods; \n The world gave signs of war: Nature reversed \n In monstrous tumult fraught with prodigies \n Her laws, and prescient spake the coming guilt. \n How seemed it just to thee, Olympus ' king, \n That suffering mortals at thy doom should know \n By dreadful omens massacres to come? \n Or did the primal parent of the world \n When first the flames gave way and yielding left \n Matter unformed to his subduing hand, \n And realms unbalanced, fix by stern decree \n Unalterable laws to bind the whole \n (Himself, too, bound by law), so that for aye \n All Nature moves within its fated bounds? \n Or, is Chance sovereign over all, and we \n The sport of Fortune and her turning wheel? \n Whate'er be truth, keep thou the future veiled \n From mortal vision, and amid their fears \n May men still hope. \n Thus known how great the woes \n The world should suffer, from the truth divine, \n A solemn fast was called, the courts were closed, \n All men in private garb; no purple hem \n Adorned the togas of the chiefs of Rome ; \n No plaints were uttered, and a voiceless grief \n Lay deep in every bosom : as when death \n Knocks at some door but enters not as yet, \n Before the mother calls the name aloud \n Or bids her grieving maidens beat the breast, \n While still she marks the glazing eye, and soothes \n The stiffening limbs and gazes on the face, \n In dread, not sorrow yet, in wondering awe \n Of death approaching: and with mind distraught \n Clings to the dying in a last embrace. \n The matrons laid aside their wonted garb: \n Crowds filled the temples-on the unpitying stones \n Some dashed their bosoms; others bathed with tears \n The statues of the gods; some tore their hair \n Upon the holy threshold, and with shrieks \n And vows unceasing called upon the names \n Of those whom mortals supplicate. Nor all \n Lay in the Thunderer's fane: at every shrine \n Some prayers were offered which refused would bring \n Reproach on heaven. One whose livid arms \n Were dark with blows, whose cheeks with tears bedewed, \n Cried, 'Now, unhappy mothers, rend the lock, \n Nor keep your sorrows till the battle day : \n Now ye may weep: when either chieftain wins \n Rejoice ye must.' Thus sorrow stirs itself. \n Meanwhile the men in seeking either camp \n And marching onward in the path to war, \n Address the cruel gods in just complaint. \n Happy the youths who born in Punic days \n On Cannae 's uplands or by Trebia's stream \n Fought and were slain! What wretched lot is ours! \n No peace we ask for: let the nations rage; \n Rouse fiercest cities! may the world find arms \n To wage a war with Rome : let Parthian hosts \n Rush forth from Susa ; Scythian Ister curb \n ' No more the Massagete: unconquered Rhine \n \n ' Let loose from furthest North her fair-haired tribes: \n ' Elbe , pour thy Suevians forth! Let us be foes \n ' Of all the peoples. May the Getan press \n ' Here, and the Dacian there; Pompeius meet \n 'The Eastern archers, Caesar in the West \n ' Confront th' Iberian. Leave to Rome no hand \n ' To raise against herself in civil strife. \n ' Or, if Italia by the gods be doomed, \n ' Let all the sky, fierce Parent, be dissolved \n 'And falling on the earth in flaming bolts, \n ' Their hands still bloodless, strike both leaders down, \n ' With both their hosts! Why plunge in novel crime \n ' To settle which of them shall rule in Rome ? \n ' Scarce were it worth the price of civil war \n ' To hinder either.' Thus the patriot voice \n Still found an utterance, soon to speak no more. \n Meantime, the aged fathers o'er their fates \n In anguish grieved, detesting life prolonged \n That brought with it another civil war.\n \n \n And thus spake one, to justify his fears: \n ' No other deeds the fates laid up in store \n ' When Marius, victor over Teuton hosts, \n ' Afric's high conqueror, cast out from Rome , \n 'Lay hid in marshy ooze, at thy behest, \n ' O Fortune! by the yielding soil concealed \n ' And waving rushes; but ere long the chains \n ' Of prison wore his weak and aged frame, \n ' And lengthened squalor: thus he paid for crime \n ' His punishment beforehand; doomed to die \n ' Consul in triumph over wasted Rome . \n 'Death oft refused him; and the very foe, \n ' In act of slaughter, shuddered in the stroke \n ' And dropped the weapon from his nerveless hand. \n ' For through the prison gloom a flame of light \n ' He saw; the deities of crime abhorred; \n ' The Marius to come. A voice proclaimed \n ' Mysterious, \" Hold! the fates permit thee not \n ' \" That neck to sever. Many a death he owes \n ' \" To time's predestined laws ere his shall come; \n ' \" Cease from thy madness. If ye seek revenge \n ' \" For that he blotted out your Cimbrian tribes, \n ' \" Let this man live, live out his fated days.\" \n ' Not as their darling did the gods protect \n ' The man of blood, but for his ruthless hand \n ' Fit to prepare that sacrifice of gore \n ' Which fate demanded. By the sea's despite \n ' Borne to our foes, Jugurtha's wasted realm \n ' He saw, now conquered; there in squalid huts \n ' Awhile he lay, and trod the hostile dust \n ' Of Carthage, and his ruin matched with hers: \n ' Each from the other's fate some solace drew, \n ' And prostrate, pardoned heaven. On Libyan soil \n ' Fresh fury gathering, next, when Fortune smiled \n 'The prisons he threw wide and freed the slaves. \n ' Forth rushed the murderous bands, their melted chains \n ' Forged into weapons for his ruffian needs. \n ' No charge he gave to mere recruits in guilt \n ' Who brought not to the camp some proof of crime. \n ' How dread that day when conquering Marius seized \n ' The city's ramparts! with what fated speed \n ' Death strode upon his victims! plebs alike \n \n ' And nobles perished; far and near the sword \n ' Struck at his pleasure, till the temple floors \n 'Ran wet with slaughter and the crimson stream \n ' Befouled with slippery gore the holy walls. \n ' No age found pity: men of failing years, \n ' Just tottering to the grave, were hurled to death; \n ' From infants, in their being's earliest dawn, \n \n ' The growing life was severed. For what crime? \n 'Twas cause enough for death that they could die. \n ' The fury grew : soon 'twas a sluggard's part \n ' To seek the guilty: hundreds died to swell \n 'The tale of victims. Shamed by empty hands, \n ' The bloodstained conqueror snatched a reeking head \n ' From neck unknown. One way of life remained, \n ' To kiss with shuddering lips the red right hand. \n \n ' Degenerate people! Had ye hearts of men, \n ' Though ye were threatened by a thousand swords, \n ' Far rather death than centuries of life \n ' Bought at such price; much more that breathing space \n ' Till Sulla comes again. But time would fail \n ' In weeping for the deaths of all who fell. \n 'Encircled by innumerable bands \n ' Fell Baebius, his limbs asunder torn, \n ' His vitals dragged abroad. Antonius too, \n ' Prophet of ill, whose hoary head was placed, \n ' Dripping with blood, upon the festal board. \n ' There headless fell the Crassi; mangled frames \n 'Neath Fimbria's falchion: and the prison cells \n ' Were wet with tribunes' blood. Hard by the fane \n ' Where dwells the goddess and the sacred fire, \n ' Fell aged Scaevola, though that gory hand \n \n ' Had spared him, but the feeble tide of blood \n ' Still left the flame alive upon the hearth. \n ' That selfsame year the seventh time restored \n \n ' The Consul's rods; that year to Marius brought \n ' The end of life, when he at Fortune's hands \n ' All ills had suffered; all her goods enjoyed. \n ' And what of those who at the Sacriport \n \n ' And Colline gate were slain, then, when the rule \n ' Of Earth and all her nations almost left \n ' This city for another, and the chiefs \n ' Who led the Samnite hoped that Rome might bleed \n ' More than at Caudium's Forks she bled of old? \n ' Then came great Sulla to avenge the dead, \n ' And all the blood still left within her frame \n ' Drew from the city; for the surgeon knife \n ' Which shore the cancerous limbs cut in too deep, \n ' And shed the life stream from still healthy veins. \n ' True that the guilty fell, but not before \n ' All else had perished. Hatred had free course \n ' And anger reigned unbridled by the law. \n ' The victor's voice spake once; but each man struck \n ' Just as he wished or willed. The fatal steel \n ' Urged by the servant laid the master low. \n ' Sons dripped with gore of sires; and brothers fought \n ' For the foul trophy of a father slain, \n ' Or slew each other for the price of blood. \n ' Men sought the tombs and, mingling with the dead, \n ' Hoped for escape; the wild beasts' dens were full. \n ' One strangled died; another from the height \n ' Fell headlong down upon the unpitying earth, \n ' And from the encrimsoned victor snatched his death: \n ' One built his funeral pyre and oped his veins, \n ' And scaled the furnace ere his blood was gone. \n ' Borne through the trembling town the leaders' heads \n ' Were piled in middle forum: hence men knew \n ' Of murders else unpublished. Not on gates \n ' Of Diomedes, tyrant king of Thrace , \n ' Nor of Antaeus, Libya 's giant brood, \n ' Were hung such horrors; nor in Pisa 's hall \n 'Were seen and wept for when the suitors died. \n ' Decay had touched the features of the slain \n ' When round the mouldering heap, with trembling steps \n ' The grief-struck parents sought and stole their dead. \n ' I, too, the body of my brother slain \n ' Thought to remove, my victim to the peace \n ' Which Sulla made, and place his loved remains \n ' On the forbidden pyre. The head I found, \n ' But not the butchered corse. \n Why now renew \n ' The tale of Catulus's shade appeased? \n ' And those dread tortures which the living frame \n ' Of Marius suffered at the tomb of him \n ' Who haply wished them not? Pierced, mangled, torn- \n ' Nor speech nor grasp was left: his every limb \n ' Maimed, hacked and riven; yet the fatal blow \n ' The murderers with savage purpose spared. \n ''Twere scarce believed that one poor mortal frame \n ' Such agonies could bear ere death should come. \n ' Thus crushed beneath some ruin lie the dead; \n ' Thus shapeless from the deep are borne the drowned. \n ' Why spoil delight by mutilating thus, \n ' The head of Marius? To please Sulla's heart \n ' That mangled visage must be known to all. \n ' Fortune, high goddess of Praeneste 's fane, \n ' Saw all her townsmen hurried to their deaths \n ' In one fell instant. All the hope of Rome , \n ' The flower of Latium , stained with blood the field \n ' Where once the peaceful tribes their votes declared. \n ' Famine and Sword, the raging sky and sea, \n ' And Earth upheaved, have laid such numbers low : \n ' But ne'er one man's revenge. Between the slain \n ' And living victims there was space no more, \n ' Death thus let slip, to deal the fatal blow. \n ' Hardly when struck they fell; the severed head \n ' Scarce toppled from the shoulders; but the slain \n ' Blent in a weighty pile of massacre \n ' Pressed out the life and helped the murderer's arm. \n ' Secure from stain upon his lofty throne, \n ' Unshuddering sat the author of the whole, \n ' Nor feared that at his word such thousands fell. \n 'At length the Tuscan flood received the dead \n ' The first upon his waves; the last on those \n ' That lay beneath them; vessels in their course \n ' Were stayed, and while the lower current flowed \n ' Yet to the sea, the upper stood on high \n Dammed back by carnage. Through the streets meanwhile \n ' In headlong torrents ran a tide of blood, \n ' Which furrowing its path through town and field \n 'Forced the slow river on. But now his banks \n ' No longer held him, and the dead were thrown \n ' Back on the fields above. With labour huge \n 'At length he struggled to his goal and stretched \n ' In crimson streak across the Tuscan Sea. \n ' For deeds like these, shall Sulla now be styled \n ' \" Darling of Fortune,\" \" Saviour of the State \"? \n ' For these, a tomb in middle field of Mars \n ' Record his fame? Like horrors now return \n ' For us to suffer; and the civil war \n ' Thus shall be waged again and thus shall end. \n 'Yet worse disasters may our fears suggest, \n ' For now with greater carnage of mankind \n ' The rival hosts in weightier battle meet. \n ' To exiled Marius, the prize of war \n ' Was Rome regained; triumphant Sulla knew \n ' No greater joy than on his hated foes \n ' To wreak his vengeance with unsparing sword. \n 'But these more powerful rivals Fortune calls \n ' To worse ambitions; nor would either chief \n 'For such reward as Sulla's wage the war.' \n Thus, mindful of his youth, the aged man \n Wept for the past, but feared the coming days.\n \n \n Such terrors found in haughty Brutus' breast \n No home. When others sat them down to fear \n He did not so, but in the dewy night \n When the great wain was turning round the pole \n He sought his kinsman Cato's humble home. \n Him sleepless did he find, not for himself \n Fearing, but pondering the fates of Rome, \n And deep in public cares. And thus he spake: \n 'O thou in whom that virtue, which of yore \n Took flight from earth, now finds its only home, \n Outcast to all besides, but safe with thee: \n Vouchsafe thy counsel to my wavering soul \n And make my weakness strength. While Caesar some, \n Pompeius others, follow in the fight, \n Cato is Brutus' guide. Art thou for peace, \n Holding thy footsteps in a tottering world \n Unshaken? Or wilt thou with the leaders' crimes \n And with the people's fury take thy part, \n And by thy presence purge the war of guilt? \n In impious battles men unsheath the sword; \n But each by cause impelled: the household crime; \n Laws feared in peace; want by the sword removed; \n And credit, in the ruin of a world \n Blending its ruin. Drawn by hope of gain, \n And not by thirst for blood, they seek the camp. \n Shall Cato for war's sake make war alone? \n What profits it through all these wicked years \n That thou hast lived untainted? This were all \n Thy meed of virtue, that the wars which find \n Guilt in all else, shall make thee guilty too. \n ' Ye gods, permit not that this fatal strife \n Should stir those hands to action! When the clouds \n Of flying javelins hiss upon the air, \n Let not a dart be thine; nor spent in vain \n Such virtue! All the fury of the war \n ' Shall launch itself on thee, for who, when faint \n ' And wounded, would not rush upon thy sword, \n 'Take thence his death, and make the murder thine? \n 'Do thou live on thy peaceful life apart \n 'As on their paths the stars unshaken roll. \n 'The lower air that verges on the earth \n ' Gives flame and fury to the levin bolt; \n ' The deeps below the world engulph the winds \n ' And tracts of flaming fire. By Jove's decree \n ' Olympus rears his summit o'er the clouds: \n 'In lowlier valleys storms and winds contend, \n ' But peace eternal reigns upon the heights. \n 'What joy for Caesar, if the tidings come \n 'That such a citizen has joined the war? \n ' Glad would he see thee e'en in Magnus' tents; \n 'For Cato's conduct shall approve his own. \n 'Pompeius, with the Consul in his ranks, \n ' And half the Senate and the other chiefs, \n ' Vexes my spirit; and should Cato too \n ' Bend to a master's yoke, in all the world \n 'The one man free is Caesar. But if thou \n ' For freedom and thy country's laws alone \n 'Be pleased to raise the sword, nor Magnus then \n ' Nor Caesar shall in Brutus find a foe. \n ' Not till the fight is fought shall Brutus strike, \n 'Then strike the victor.' \n Brutus thus; but spake \n Cato from inmost breast these sacred words: \n 'Chief in all wickedness is civil war, \n ' Yet virtue in the paths marked out by fate \n 'Treads on securely. Heaven's will be the crime \n 'To have made even Cato guilty. Who has strength \n ' To gaze unawed upon a toppling world? \n 'When stars and sky fall headlong, and when earth \n 'Slips from her base, who sits with folded hands? \n 'Shall unknown nations, touched by western strife, \n ' And monarchs born beneath another clime \n ' Brave the dividing seas to join the war? \n ' Shall Scythian tribes desert their distant north, \n ' And Getae haste to view the fall of Rome , \n 'And I look idly on? As some fond sire, \n ' Reft of his sons, compelled by grief, himself \n ' Marshals the long procession to the tomb, \n ' Thrusts his own hand within the funeral flames, \n ' Soothing his heart, and, as the lofty pyre \n 'Rises on high, applies the kindled torch: \n ' Nought, Rome , shall tear thee from me, till I hold \n ' Thy form in death embraced; and Freedom's name, \n ' Shade though it be, I'll follow to the grave. \n ' Yea! let the cruel gods exact in full \n ' Rome 's expiation : of no drop of blood \n ' The war be robbed. I would that, to the gods \n ' Of heaven and hell devoted, this my life \n ' Might satisfy their vengeance. Decius fell, \n ' Crushed by the hostile ranks. When Cato falls \n ' Let Rhine's fierce barbarous hordes and both the hosts \n 'Thrust through my frame their darts! May I alone \n ' Receive in death the wounds of all the war! \n 'Thus may the people be redeemed, and thus \n ' Rome for her guilt pay the atonement due. \n ' Why should men die who wish to bear the yoke \n ' And shrink not from the tyranny to come? \n 'Strike me, and me alone, of laws and rights \n 'In vain the guardian: this vicarious life \n ' Shall give Hesperia peace and end her toils. \n ' Who then will reign shall find no need for war. \n ' You ask, Why follow Magnus? If he wins \n \n ' He too will claim the Empire of the world. \n ' Then let him, conquering with my service, learn \n ' Not for himself to conquer.' Thus he spoke \n And stirred the blood that ran in Brutus ' veins \n Moving the youth to action in the war.\n \n \n Soon as the sun dispelled the chilly night, \n The sounding doors flew wide, and from the tomb \n Of dead Hortensius grieving Marcia came. \n \n First joined in wedlock to a greater man \n Three children did she bear to grace his home: \n Then Cato to Hortensius gave the dame \n To be a fruitful mother of his sons \n And join their houses in a closer tie. \n And now the last sad offices were done \n She came with hair dishevelled, beaten breast, \n And ashes on her brow, and features worn \n With grief; thus only pleasing to the man. \n ' When youth was in me and maternal power \n ' I did thy bidding, Cato , and received \n ' A second husband: now in years grown old \n ' Ne'er to be parted I return to thee. \n ' Renew our former pledges undefiled: \n ' Give back the name of wife: upon my tomb \n ' Let \" Marcia , spouse to Cato ,\" be engraved. \n ' Nor let men question in the time to come, \n ' Didst thou compel, or did I willing leave \n ' My first espousals. Not in happy times, \n ' Partner of joys, I come; but days of care \n ' And labour shall be mine to share with thee. \n ' Nor leave me here, but take me to the camp, \n ' Thy fond companion: why should Magnus' wife \n ' Be nearer, Cato , to the wars than thine?' \n Although the times were warlike and the fates \n Called to the fray, he lent a willing ear. \n Yet must they plight their faith in simple form \n Of law; their witnesses the gods alone. \n No festal wreath of flowers crowned the gate \n Nor glittering fillet on each post entwined; \n No flaming torch was there, nor ivory steps, \n No couch with robes of broidered gold adorned; \n No comely matron placed upon her brow \n The bridal garland, or forbad the foot \n \n To touch the threshold stone; no saffron veil \n Concealed the timid blushes of the bride; \n No jewelled belt confined her flowing robe \n \n Nor modest circle bound her neck; no scarf \n Hung lightly on the snowy shoulder's edge \n Around the naked arm. Just as she came, \n Wearing the garb of sorrow, while the wool \n Covered the purple border of her robe, \n Thus was she wedded. As she greets her sons \n She greets her husband. Nor, in Sabine use \n Did mournful Cato share the festal taunt: \n Nor friend nor foe was bidden : silent both \n They joined in marriage, yet content, unseen \n By any save by Brutus . Sad and stern \n On Cato 's lineaments the marks of grief \n Were still unsoftened, and the hoary hair \n Hung o'er his reverend visage; for since first \n Men flew to arms, his locks were left unkempt \n To stream upon his brow, and on his chin \n His beard untended grew. 'Twas his alone \n Who hated not, nor loved, for all mankind \n To mourn alike. Nor did their former couch \n Again receive them, for his lofty soul \n E'en lawful love resisted. 'Twas his rule \n \n Inflexible, to keep the middle path \n Marked out and bounded; to observe the laws \n Of natural right; and for his country's sake \n To risk his life, his all, as not for self \n Brought into being, but for all the world: \n Such was his creed. To him a sumptuous feast \n Was hunger conquered, and the lowly hut, \n Which scarce kept out the winter, was a home \n Equal to palaces: a robe of price \n Such hairy garments as were worn of old: \n The end of marriage, offspring. To the State \n Father alike and husband, right and law \n He ever followed with unswerving step: \n No thought of selfish pleasure turned the scale \n In Cato 's acts, or swayed his upright soul. \n Meanwhile Pompeius led his trembling host \n To fields Campanian, and held the walls \n First founded by the chief of Trojan race. \n These chose he for the central seat of war, \n Some troops despatching who might meet the foe \n Where shady Apennine lifts up the ridge \n Of mid Italia ; nearest to the sky \n Upsoaring, with the seas on either hand, \n The upper and the lower. Pisa 's sands \n Breaking the margin of the Tuscan deep, \n Here bound his mountains: there Ancona 's towers \n Laved by Dalmatian waves. Rivers immense, \n In his recesses born, pass on their course, \n To either sea diverging. To the left \n Metaurus and Crustumium's torrent fall \n And Sena 's streams and Aufidus who bursts \n On Adrian billows; and that mighty flood \n Which, more than all the rivers of the earth, \n Sweeps down the soil and tears the woods away \n And drains Hesperia's springs. In fabled lore \n His banks were first by poplar shade enclosed: \n \n And when by Phaethon the waning day \n Was drawn in path transverse, and all the heaven \n Blazed with his car aflame, and from the depths \n Of inmost earth were rapt all other floods, \n \n Padus still rolled in pride of stream along. \n \n Nile were no larger, but that o'er the sand \n Of level Egypt he spreads out his waves; \n Nor Ister, if he sought the Scythian main \n Unhelped upon his journey through the world \n By tributary waters not his own. \n But on the right hand Tiber has his source, \n Deep-flowing Rutuba, Vulturnus swift, \n And Sarnus breathing vapours of the night \n \n Rise there, and Liris with Vestinian wave \n Still gliding through Marica 's shady grove, \n And Siler flowing through Salernian meads: \n And Macra's swift unnavigable stream \n Near Luna rests in Ocean. On the Alps \n \n Whose spurs strike plainwards, and on fields of Gaul \n \n The cloudy heights of Apennine look down \n In further distance: on his nearer slopes \n The Sabine turns the ploughshare; Umbrian kine \n And Marsian fatten; with his pineclad rocks \n He girds the tribes of Latium , nor leaves \n Hesperia's soil until the waves that beat \n On Scylla's cave compel. His southern spurs \n Extend to Juno's temple, and of old \n Stretched further than Italia , till the main \n O'erstepped his limits and the lands repelled. \n But, when the seas were joined, Pelorus claimed \n His latest summits for Sicilia 's isle.\n \n \n Caesar, in rage for war, rejoicing finds \n Foes in Italia ; no bloodless steps \n Nor vacant homes had pleased him; so his march \n Were wasted: now the coming war was joined \n Unbroken to the past; to force the gates, \n Not find them open, fire and sword to bring \n Upon the harvests, not through fields unharmed \n To pass his legions-this was Caesar's joy; \n In peaceful guise to march, this was his shame. \n \n Italia 's cities, doubtful in their choice, \n Though to the earliest onset of the war \n About to yield, strengthen their walls with mounds \n And deepest trench encircling: massive stones \n And bolts of war to hurl upon the foe \n They place upon the turrets. Magnus most \n The people's favour held, yet faith with fear \n Fought in their breasts. As when, with strident blast, \n A southern tempest has possessed the main \n And all the billows follow in its track: \n Then, by the Storm-king smitten, should the earth \n Set Eurus free upon the swollen deep, \n It shall not yield to him, though cloud and sky \n Confess his strength; but in the former wind \n Still find its master. But their fears prevailed, \n And Caesar's fortune, o'er their wavering faith. \n For Libo fled Etruria; Umbria lost \n Her freedom, driving Thermus from her bounds; \n Great Sulla's son, unworthy of his sire, \n Feared at the name of Caesar: Varus sought \n The caves and woods, when smote the hostile horse \n The gates of Auximon; and Spinther driven \n From Asculum , the victor on his track, \n Fled with his standards, soldierless; and thou, \n Scipio, didst leave Nuceria's citadel \n Deserted, though by bravest legions held \n Sent home by Caesar for the Parthian war; \n \n Whom Magnus earlier, to his kinsman gave \n A loan of Roman blood, to fight the Gaul . \n But brave Domitius held firm his post \n \n Behind Corfinium 's ramparts; his the troops \n Who newly levied kept the judgment hall \n At Milo 's trial. When from far the plain \n Rolled up a dusty cloud, beneath whose veil \n The sheen of armour glistening in the sun, \n Revealed a marching host. ' Dash down,' he cried, \n Swift as ye can, the bridge that spans the stream; \n And thou, O river, from thy mountain source \n With all thy torrents rushing, planks and beams \n Ruined and broken on thy foaming breast \n Bear onward to the sea. The war shall pause \n Here, at these bounds : here shall this headlong chief \n Await in idleness our victory.' \n He bade his squadrons, speeding from the walls, \n Charge on the bridge: in vain: for Caesar saw \n They sought to free the river from his chains \n \n And bar his march; and roused to ire, he cried: \n Were not the walls sufficient to protect \n Your coward souls? Seek ye by barricades \n And streams to keep me back? What though the flood \n Of swollen Ganges were across my path? \n Now Rubicon is passed, no stream on earth \n Shall hinder Caesar! Forward, horse and foot, \n And ere it totters rush upon the bridge.' \n Urged in their swiftest gallop to the front \n Dashed the light horse across the sounding plain; \n And suddenly, as storm in summer, flew \n A cloud of javelins forth, by sinewy arms \n Hurled at the foe; the guard is put to flight, \n And conquering Caesar, seizing on the bridge, \n Compels the enemy to keep the walls. \n Now do the mighty engines, soon to hurl \n Gigantic stones, press forward, and the ram \n Creeps 'neath the ramparts; when the gates fly back, \n And lo! the traitor troops (foul crime in war) \n Yield up their leader. Him they place before \n His proud compatriot; yet with upright form, \n And scornful features and with noble mien, \n He asks his death. But Caesar knew his wish \n Was punishment, and pardon was his fear: \n Live though thou wouldst not,' so the chieftain spake, \n And by my gift, unwilling, see the day: \n Be to my conquered foes the cause of hope, \n Proof of my clemency-or if thou wilt \n Take arms again-and should'st thou conquer, count \n This pardon nothing.' Thus he spake, and bade \n Let loose the bands and set the captive free. \n Ah! better had he died, and fortune spared \n The Roman's last dishonour, whose worse doom \n It is, that he who joined his country's camp \n And fought with Magnus for the Senate's cause \n Should gain for this-a pardon! Yet he curbed \n His anger, thinking, ' Wilt thou then to Rome \n \n ' And peaceful scenes, degenerate? Rather war, \n The furious battle and the certain end! \n Break with life's ties : be Caesar's gift in vain.'\n \n \n Pompeius, ignorant that his captain thus \n Was taken, armed his levies newly raised \n To give his legions strength; and as he thought \n To sound his trumpets with the coming dawn, \n To test his soldiers ere he moved his camp \n Thus in majestic tones their ranks addressed: \n True host of Rome ! avengers of her laws \n Ranked 'neath the standards of the better right, \n To whom the Senate gives no private arms, \n Ask by your voices for the battle sign. \n Fierce falls the pillage on Hesperian fields, \n And Gallia 's fury o'er the snowy Alps \n \n Is poured upon us. Caesar's swords at last \n ' Are red with Roman blood. But with the wound \n We gain the better cause; the crime is theirs. \n Through me her captain Rome for vengeance calls; \n ' Tis no true fight to wreak your country's ire. \n ' Was that a war when Catilina's hand \n ' Lifted against her roofs the flaming torch, \n ' And, partner in his fury, Lentulus, \n ' And mad Cethegus with his naked arm? \n ' Is such thy madness, Caesar? when the Fates \n ' With great Camillus' and Metellus' names \n ' Might place thine own, dost thou prefer to rank \n ' With Marius and Cinna? Swift shall be \n ' Thy fall: as Lepidus before the sword \n ' Of Catulus; or who my axes felt, \n ' Carbo , now buried in Sicanian tomb; \n ' Or who, in exile, roused Iberia 's hordes, \n ' Sertorius-yet, witness Heaven, with these \n ' I hate to rank thee; hate the task that Rome \n \n ' Has laid upon me, to oppose thy rage. \n ' Would that in safety from the Parthian war \n ' And Scythian steppes had conquering Crassus come! \n ' Then haply hadst thou fallen by the hand \n ' That smote vile Spartacus the robber foe. \n ' But if among my triumphs fate has said \n ' Thy conquest shall be written, know this heart \n ' Still sends the life blood coursing: and this arm \n ' Still vigorously flings the dart afield. \n ' He deems me slothful. Caesar, thou shalt learn \n 'We brook not peace because we lag in war. \n ' Old, does he call me? Fear not ye mine age. \n \n ' Let me be elder, if his soldiers are. \n ' The highest point a citizen can reach \n ' And leave his people free, is mine: a throne \n ' Alone were higher; whoso would surpass \n ' Pompeius, aims at that. Both Consuls stand \n ' Here; here for battle stand your lawful chiefs: \n ' And shall this Caesar drag the Senate down? \n ' Not with such blindness, not so lost to shame \n ' Does Fortune rule. Does he take heart from Gaul , \n ' For years on years rebellious, and a life \n ' Spent there in labour? or because he fled \n ' Rhine 's icy torrent and the shifting pools \n ' He calls an ocean? or unchallenged sought \n ' Britannia 's cliffs; then turned his back in flight? \n ' Or does he boast because his citizens \n ' Were driven in arms to leave their hearths and homes? \n 'Ah, vain delusion! not from thee they fled: \n ' My steps they follow-mine, whose conquering signs \n ' Swept all the ocean, and who, ere the moon \n ' Twice filled her orb and waned, compelled to flight \n ' The pirate, shrinking from the open sea, \n ' And humbly begging for a narrow home \n ' In some poor nook on shore. 'Twas I again \n ' Who, happier far than Sulla, drave to death \n \n ' That king who, exiled to the deep recess \n ' Of Scythian Pontus, held the fates of Rome \n \n ' Still in the balances. Where is the land \n ' That has not seen my trophies? Icy waves \n ' Of northern Phasis , hot Egyptian shores, \n ' And where Syene 'neath its noontide sun \n ' Knows shade on neither hand: all these have learned \n ' To fear Pompeius: and far Baetis' stream, \n ' Last of all floods to join the refluent sea. \n ' Arabia and the warlike hordes that dwell \n ' Beside the Euxine wave: the famous land \n ' That lost the golden fleece; Cilician wastes, \n ' And Cappadocian, and the Jews who pray \n ' Before an unknown God; Sophene soft- \n ' All felt my yoke. What conquests now remain, \n ' What wars not civil can my kinsman wage? ' \n No loud acclaim received his words, nor shout \n Asked for the promised battle: and the chief \n Drew back the standards, for the soldier's fears \n Were in his soul alike; nor dared he trust \n An army, vanquished by the fame alone \n Of Caesar's powers, to fight for such a prize. \n And as some bull, his early combat lost, \n Forth driven from the herd, in exile roams \n Through lonely plains or secret forest depths, \n Whets on opposing trunks his growing horn, \n And proves himself for battle, till his neck \n Is ribbed afresh with muscle: then returns, \n Defiant of the hind, and victor now \n Leads wheresoever he will his lowing bands: \n Thus Magnus, yielding to a stronger foe, \n Gave up Italia , and sought in flight \n \n Brundusium 's sheltering battlements. Here of old \n Fled Cretan settlers when the dusky sail \n \n Spread the false message of the hero dead; \n Here, where Hesperia, curving as a bow, \n Draws back her coast, a little tongue of land \n Shuts in with bending horns the sounding main. \n Yet insecure the spot, unsafe in storm, \n Were it not sheltered by an isle on which \n The Adriatic billows dash and fall, \n And tempests lose their strength: on either hand \n A craggy cliff opposing breaks the gale \n That beats upon them, while the ships within \n Held by their trembling cables ride secure. \n Hence to the mariner the boundless deep \n Lies open, whether for Corcyra 's port \n He shapes his sails, or for Illyria 's shore, \n And Epidamnus facing to the main \n Ionian. Here, when raging in his might \n Fierce Adria whelms in foam Calabria 's coast, \n When clouds tempestuous veil Ceraunus' height, \n The sailor finds a haven. \n \n \n When the chief \n Could find no hope in battle on the soil \n He now was quitting, and the lofty Alps \n \n Forbad Iberia, to his son he spake, \n The eldest scion of that noble stock: \n Search out the far recesses of the earth, \n ' Nile and Euphrates , wheresoe'er the fame \n Of Magnus lives, where, through thy father's deeds, \n The people tremble at the name of Rome . \n 'Lead to the sea again the pirate bands; \n 'Rouse Egypt's kings; Tigranes, wholly mine, \n 'And Pharnaces and all the vagrant tribes \n 'Of both Armenias; and the Pontic hordes, \n ' Warlike and fierce; the dwellers on the hills \n 'Rhipaean, and by that dead northern marsh \n 'Whose frozen surface bears the loaded wain. \n Why further stay thee? Let the eastern world \n Sound with the war, all cities of the earth \n 'Conquered by me, as vassals, to my camp \n 'Send all their levied hosts. And you whose names \n 'Within the Latian book recorded stand, \n 'Strike for Epirus with the northern wind; \n 'And thence in Greece and Macedonian tracts, \n (While winter gives us peace) new strength acquire \n 'For coming conflicts.' They obey his words \n And loose their ships and launch upon the main. \n But Caesar's might, intolerant of peace \n Or lengthy armistice, lest now perchance \n The fates might change their edicts, swift pursued \n The footsteps of his foe. To other men, \n So many cities taken at a blow, \n So many strongholds captured, might suffice; \n And Rome herself, the mistress of the world, \n Lay at his feet, the greatest prize of all. \n Not so with Caesar: instant on the goal \n He fiercely presses; thinking nothing done \n \n While aught remained to do. Now in his grasp \n Lay all Italia ;-but while Magnus stayed \n Upon the utmost shore, his grieving soul \n Deemed all was shared with him. Yet he essayed \n Escape to hinder, and with labour vain \n Piled in the greedy main gigantic rocks: \n Mountains of earth down to the sandy depths \n Were swallowed by the vortex of the sea; \n Just as if Eryx and its lofty top \n Were cast into the deep, yet not a speck \n Should mark the watery plain; or Gaurus huge \n Split from his summit to his base, were plunged \n In fathomless Avernus' stagnant pool. \n The billows thus unstemmed, 'twas Caesar's will \n To hew the stately forests and with trees \n Enchained to form a rampart. Thus of old \n (If fame be true) the boastful Persian king \n Prepared a way across the rapid strait \n 'Twixt Sestos and Abydos , and made one \n The European and the Trojan shores; \n And marched upon the waters, wind and storm \n Counting as nought, but trusting his emprise \n To one frail bridge, so that his ships might pass \n Through middle Athos . Thus a mighty mole \n Of fallen forests grew upon the waves, \n Free until then, and lofty turrets rose, \n And land usurped the entrance to the main. \n This when Pompeius saw, with anxious care \n His soul was filled; yet hoping to regain \n The exit lost, and win a wider world \n Wherein to wage the war, on chosen ships \n He hoists the sails; these, driven by the wind \n Which filled the bellying sails, not once nor twice \n Scattered the beams asunder; and at night \n Not seldom engines, worked by stalwart arms, \n Flung flaming torches forth. But when the time \n For secret flight was come, no sailor shout \n Rang on the shore, no trumpet marked the hour, \n No clarion called the armament to sea. \n Already shone the Virgin in the sky \n Leading the Scorpion in her course, whose claws \n Foretell the rising Sun, when noiseless all \n They cast the vessels loose; no song was heard \n To greet the anchor wrenched from stubborn sand; \n No captain's order, when the lofty mast \n Was raised, or yards were bent; a silent crew \n Drew down the sails which hung upon the ropes, \n Nor shook the mighty cables, lest the wind \n Should sound upon them. But the chief, in prayer, \n Thus spake to Fortune: ' Thou whose high decree \n Has made us exiles from Italia 's shores, \n Grant us at least to leave them.' Yet the fates \n Hardly permitted, for a murmur vast \n Came from the ocean, as the countless keels \n Furrowed the waters, and with ceaseless splash \n The parted billows rose again and fell. \n Then were the gates thrown wide; for with the fates \n The city turned to Caesar: and the foe, \n Seizing the town, rushed onward by the pier \n That circled in the harbour; then they knew \n With shame and sorrow that the fleet was gone \n And held the open: and Pompeius' flight \n Gave a poor triumph. Yet was narrower far \n The channel which gave access to the sea \n Than that Euboean strait whose waters lave \n The shore by Chalcis . Here two ships stuck fast \n Alone, of all the fleet; the fatal hook \n Grappled their decks and drew them to the land, \n And the first bloodshed of the civil war \n Here left a blush upon the ocean wave. \n As when the famous ship sought Phasis ' stream \n The rocky gates closed in and hardly gripped \n Her flying stern; then from the empty sea \n The cliffs rebounding to their ancient seat \n Were fixed to move no more. But now the steps \n Of morn approaching tinged the eastern sky \n With roseate hues: the Pleiades were dim, \n The wagon of the Charioteer grew pale, \n The planets faded, and the silvery star \n Which ushers in the day, was lost in light. \n Thou, Magnus, hold'st the deep; yet not the same \n Now are thy fates, as when from every sea \n Thy fleet triumphant swept the pirate pest. \n Tired of thy conquests, Fortune now no more \n Shall smile upon thee. With thy spouse and sons, \n Thy household gods, and peoples in thy train, \n Still great in exile, in a distant land \n Thou seek'st thy fated fall; not that the gods, \n Wishing to rob thee of a Roman grave, \n Decreed the strands of Egypt for thy tomb: \n 'Twas Italy they spared, that far away \n Fortune on shores remote might hide her crime, \n And Roman soil be pure of Magnus' blood.\n \n "

            "0":"\n WITH canvas yielding to the southern wind \n The navy sailed the deep, and every eye \n Gazed on Ionian billows. But the chief \n Turned not his vision from his native shore \n Now left for ever, while the morning mists \n Drew down upon the mountains, and the cliffs \n Faded in distance till his aching sight \n No longer knew them. Then his wearied frame \n Sank in the arms of sleep. But Julia's shape, \n In mournful guise, dread horror on her brow, \n Rose through the gaping earth, and from her tomb \n Erect, in form as of a Fury spake: \n 'Driven from Elysian fields and from the plains \n 'The blest inhabit, when the war began, \n 'I dwell in Stygian darkness where abide \n 'The souls of all the guilty. There I saw \n 'Th' Eumenides with torches in their hands \n 'Prepared against thy battles; and the fleets \n \n ' Which by the ferryman of the flaming stream \n 'Were made to bear thy dead: and Hell enlarged \n 'To hold thy punishments: the sisters three \n ' With busy fingers all their needful task \n ' Could scarce accomplish, and the threads of fate \n 'Dropped from their weary hands. With me thy wife, \n 'Thou, Magnus, leddest happy triumphs home: \n 'New wedlock brings new luck. Thy concubine, \n ' Whose star brings all her mighty husbands ill, \n 'Cornelia, weds in thee a breathing tomb. \n \n 'Through wars and oceans let her cling to thee \n 'So long as I may break thy nightly rest: \n ' No moment left thee for her love, but all \n 'By night to me, by day to Caesar given. \n 'Me not the oblivious banks of Lethe's stream \n ' Have made forgetful; and the kings of death \n ' Have suffered me to join thee; in mid fight \n 'I will be with thee, and my haunting ghost \n 'Remind thee Caesar's daughter was thy spouse. \n 'Thy sword kills not our pledges; civil war \n 'Shall make thee wholly mine.' She spake and fled. \n But he, though heaven and hell thus bode defeat, \n More bent on war, with mind assured of ill, \n 'Why dread vain phantoms of a dreaming brain? \n Or nought of sense and feeling to the soul \n Is left by death; or death itself is nought.' \n Now fiery Titan in declining path \n Dipped to the waves, his bright circumference \n So much diminished as a growing moon \n Not yet full circled, or when past the full; \n When to the fleet a hospitable coast \n Gave access, and the ropes in order laid, \n The sailors struck the masts and rowed ashore. \n Thus was the fleet set free and rapt from view \n By favouring breezes. On Italian soil \n Sole lord stood Caesar: but he found no joy \n In triumph over Magnus-rather grieved \n That thus in safety had his flight been sped. \n Not any gifts of fortune now sufficed \n His fiery spirit; and no victory won, \n Unless the war was finished with the stroke. \n Then arms he laid aside, in guise of peace \n Seeking the people's favour; skilled to know \n How to arouse their ire, and how to gain \n The popular love by corn in plenty given. \n Alone through famine cities can be won; \n By food a tyrant bribes the crowd to cringe; \n And starving peoples know not how to fear. \n He orders Curio to stem the waves \n And cross to lands Sicilian, where of old \n Or ocean by a sudden rise o'erwhelmed \n The land, or split the isthmus right in twain, \n Leaving a path for seas. The mighty deep \n There labours ever lest again should meet \n The mountains rent asunder. Nor were left \n Sardinian shores unvisited: each isle \n Is blest with noble harvests which have filled \n More than all else the granaries of Rome , \n And poured their plenty on Hesperia's shores. \n Not even Libya , with its fertile soil, \n Their yield surpasses, when the southern wind \n Gives way to northern and permits the clouds \n To drop their moisture on the teeming earth. \n This ordered, Caesar leads his legions on, \n Not armed for war, but as in time of peace \n Returning to his home. Ah! had he come \n With only Gallia conquered and the North, \n \n What long array of triumph had he brought! \n What pictured scenes of battle! how had Rhine \n \n And Ocean borne his chains! How noble Gaul , \n And Britain 's fair-haired chiefs his lofty car \n Had followed! Such a triumph had he lost \n By further conquest. Now in silent fear \n They watched his marching troops, nor joyful towns \n Poured out their crowds to welcome his return. \n Yet did the conqueror's proud soul rejoice, \n Far more than at their love, at such a fear.\n \n \n Now Anxur 's hold was passed, the oozy road \n That separates the marsh, the grove sublime \n \n Where reigns the Scythian goddess, and the path \n By which men bear the fasces to the feast \n On Alba's summit. From the height afar- \n Gazing in awe upon the walls of Rome \n \n His native city, since the Northern war \n Unseen, unvisited-thus Caesar spake: \n 'Seat of the gods, have men deserted thee, \n 'Thee, Rome , without a blow? Then for what town \n 'Shall men do battle? Thank the gods, no host \n 'From Eastern climes has sought Italia 's shores \n 'To wreak its fury; nor Sarmatian horde \n 'With northern tribes conjoined; by Fortune's gift \n 'This war is civil: else this coward chief \n 'Had been thy ruin.' \n Trembling at his feet \n He found the city: deadly fire and flame, \n As from a conqueror; gods and fanes dispersed; \n Such was the measure of their fear, as though \n His power and wish were one. No festal shout \n Greeted his march, no feigned acclaim of joy. \n Scarce had they time for hate. In Phoebus' hall \n Their hiding places left, a crowd appeared \n Of Senators, uncalled, for none could call. \n No Consul there the sacred shrine adorned \n Nor Praetor next in rank, and every seat \n Placed for the officers of state was void: \n Caesar was all; his private voice was heard; \n \n All else were dumb. They sat prepared to vote \n For him a throne or temple; for themselves \n Or death or exile. Thank the gods that he \n Blushed more to order than did Rome to serve. \n Yet in one breast the spirit of Freedom rose \n Enraged lest force should override the laws; \n For hot Metellus, when he saw the gates \n Of Saturn's temple yielding to the shock, \n With rapid step burst in between the ranks \n Of Caesar's troops, and stood before the doors \n As yet unopened. 'Tis the love of gold \n Alone that fears not death; no hand is raised \n For perished laws or violated rights: \n But for this dross, the vilest cause of all, \n Men fight and die. Thus did the Tribune bar \n The victor's road to rapine, and with voice \n Clear ringing spake: ' Save o'er Metellus dead \n 'This temple opens not; my sacred blood \n ' Shall flow, thou robber, ere the gold be thine. \n 'And surely shall the Tribune's power defied \n 'Find an avenging god; this Crassus knew, \n \n ' Who, followed by our curses, sought the war \n 'And met disaster on the Parthian plains. \n ' All Rome is empty; draw thy falchion then, \n 'Nor fear a crowd to gaze upon the crime. \n 'Not from our treasury reward for guilt \n 'Thy hosts shall ravish : other towns are left, \n 'And other nations; seek thy gifts from them; \n 'Nor drain Rome 's peace for spoil: war still is thine.' \n Aroused to anger then the victor spake: \n ' Vain is thy hope to fall in noble death; \n 'Dost reckon Freedom safe with thee for guard? \n ' With all thine honours, thou of Caesar's rage \n 'Art little worthy: never shall thy blood \n ' Defile his hand. Time lowest things with high \n ' Confounds not yet so much that, if thy voice \n ' Could save the laws, it were not better far \n 'They fell by Caesar.' Such his lofty words. \n But as the Tribune yielded not, his rage \n Rose yet the more, and at his soldiers' swords \n One look he cast, forgetting for the time \n What robe he wore; but soon Metellus heard \n These words from Cotta: ' When men bow to power \n ' Freedom of speech is only Freedom's bane, \n \n ' Whose shade at least survives, if with free will \n ' Thou dost whate'er is bidden thee. For us \n ' Some pardon may be found: a host of ills \n ' Compelled submission, and the shame is less \n 'That to have done which could not be refused. \n ' Yield, then, this wealth, the seeds of direful war. \n ' A nation's anger is by losses stirred, \n ' When laws protect it; but the hungry slave \n ' Brings danger to his master, not himself.' \n At this Metellus yielded from the path; \n And as the gates rolled backward, echoed loud \n \n The rock Tarpeian, and the temple's depths \n Gave up the treasure which for centuries \n No hand had touched: all that the Punic foe \n And Perses and Philippus conquered gave, \n And all the gold which Pyrrhus panic-struck \n Left when he fled: that gold, the price of Rome, \n Which yet Fabricius sold not, and the hoard \n Laid up by saving sires; the tribute sent \n By Asia 's richest nations; and the wealth \n Which conquering Metellus brought from Crete , \n And Cato bore from distant Cyprus home; \n And last, the riches torn from captive kings \n And borne before Pompeius when he came \n In frequent triumph. Thus was robbed the shrine, \n And Caesar first brought poverty to Rome .\n \n \n Meanwhile all nations of the earth were moved \n To share in Magnus' fortunes and the war, \n And in his fated ruin. Graecia sent, \n Nearest of all, her succours to the host. \n From Cirrha and Parnassus ' double peak \n And from Amphissa , Phocis sent her youth: \n From swift Cephisus' fate-declaring stream, \n And Theban Dirce, chiefs Boeotian came: \n All Pisa mustered and Alpheus' youths, \n \n Alpheus who in far Sicilian lands \n Beyond the billows seeks the day again: \n Arcadian Maenalus, and OEta loved \n By Hercules, and old Dodona 's oaks \n Are left to silence; for the sacred train \n With all Epirus rushes to the war. \n \n Athens , deserted at the call to arms, \n Yet found three vessels in Apollo's port \n To prove her triumph o'er the Persian king. \n Next seek the battle Creta 's hundred tribes \n Beloved of Jove and rivalling the east \n In skill to wing the arrow from the bow. \n The walls of Dardan Oricum, the woods \n Where Athamanians wander, and the banks \n Of swift Absyrtus foaming to the main \n Are left forsaken. Enchelaean tribes \n Whose king was Cadmus, and whose name records \n His transformation, join the host; and those \n Who till Penean fields and turn the share \n Above Iolcos in Thessalian lands. \n There first men steeled their hearts to dare the waves \n \n And 'gainst the rage of ocean and the storm \n To match their strength, when the rude Argo sailed \n Upon that distant quest, and spurned the shore, \n Joining remotest nations in her flight, \n And gave the fates another form of death. \n Left too was Pholoe; pretended home \n Where dwelt the fabled race of double form; \n \n Arcadian Maenalus; the Thracian mount \n Named Hemus; Strymon, whence, as autumn falls, \n Winged squadrons seek the banks of warmer Nile ; \n And all those isles the mouths of Ister bathe \n Mixed with the tidal wave; the land through which \n The cooling eddies of Caicus flow \n Idalian; and Arisbe bare of glebe. \n The hinds of Pitane , and those who till \n Celaenae's fields which mourned of yore the gift \n Of Pallas, and the vengeance of the god, \n All draw the sword; and those from Marsyas' flood \n First swift, then doubling backwards with the stream \n Of sinuous Meander: and from where \n Earth gives Pactolus and his golden store \n Free passage forth; and where with rival wealth \n Rich Hermus parts the meads. Nor stayed the bands \n Of Troy , but (doomed as in old time) they joined \n Pompeius' fated camp: nor held them back \n The fabled past, nor Caesar's claimed descent \n From their Iulus. Syrian peoples came \n From palmy Idumea and the walls \n Of Ninus great of yore; from windy plains \n Of far Damascus and from Gaza 's hold, \n From Sidon 's courts enriched with purple dye, \n And Tyre oft trembling with the shaken earth. \n All these led on by Cynosura's light \n \n Furrow their certain path to reach the war. \n Phoenicians first (if story be believed) \n Dared to record in characters; for yet \n Papyrus was not fashioned, and the priests \n Of Memphis , carving symbols upon walls \n Of mystic sense (in shape of beast or fowl) \n Preserved the secrets of their magic art. \n Next Persean Tarsus and high Taurus' groves \n Are left deserted, and Corycium's cave; \n And all Cilicia 's ports, pirate no more, \n Resound with preparation. Nor the East \n Refused the call, where furthest Ganges dares, \n Alone of rivers, to discharge his stream \n Against the sun opposing; on this shore \n \n The Macedonian conqueror stayed his foot \n And found the world his victor; Indus rolls \n Here his vast torrent, by Hydaspes joined \n Yet scarce augmented; here from luscious reed \n Men draw sweet liquor; here they dye their locks \n With tints of saffron, and with coloured gems \n Bind down their flowing garments; here are they, \n Who satiate of life and proud to die, \n Ascend the blazing pyre, and conquering fate, \n Scorn to live longer; but triumphant give \n The remnant of their days in flame to heaven. \n \n Nor failed to join the host a hardy band \n Of Cappadocians, tilling now the soil, \n Once pirates of the main : nor those who dwell \n Where steep Niphates hurls the avalanche, \n And where on Median Coatra's sides \n The giant forest rises to the sky. \n And you, Arabians, from your distant home \n Came to a world unknown, and wondering saw \n The shadows fall no longer to the left. \n \n Then fired with ardour for the Roman war \n Oretas came, and far Carmania's chiefs, \n Whose clime lies southward, yet men thence descry \n Low down the Pole star, and Bootes runs \n Hasting to set, part seen, his nightly course; \n And Ethiopians from that southern land \n Which lies without the circuit of the stars, \n Did not the Bull with curving hoof advanced \n O'erstep the limit. From that mountain zone \n They came, where rising from a common fount \n \n Euphrates flows and Tigris , and did earth \n Permit, were joined with either name; but now \n While like th' Egyptian flood Euphrates spreads \n His fertilising water, Tigris first \n Drawn down by earth in covered depths is plunged \n And holds a secret course; then born again \n Flows on unhindered to the Persian sea. \n But warlike Parthia wavered 'twixt the chiefs, \n Content to have made them two ; while Scythia 's hordes \n Dipped fresh their darts in poison, whom the stream \n Of Bactros bounds and vast Hyrcanian woods. \n Hence springs that rugged nation swift and fierce, \n Descended from the Twins' great charioteer. \n \n Nor failed Sarmatia , nor the tribes that dwell \n By richest Phasis , and on Halys' banks, \n Which sealed the doom of Croesus king; nor where \n From far Rhipaean ranges Tanais flows, \n On either hand a quarter of the world, \n \n Asia and Europe , and in winding course \n Carves out a continent; nor where the strait \n In boiling surge pours to the Pontic deep \n Maeotis' waters, rivalling the pride \n Of those Herculean pillar-gates that guard \n The entrance to an ocean. Thence with hair \n In golden fillets, Arimaspians came, \n And fierce Massagetae, who quaff the blood \n Of the brave steed on which they fight and flee. \n Not when great Cyrus on Memnonian realms \n His warriors poured; nor when, their weapons piled, \n \n The Persian told the number of his host; \n Nor when th' avenger of a brother's shame \n Loaded the billows with his mighty fleet, \n Beneath one chief so many kings made war; \n Nor e'er met nations varied thus in garb \n And thus in language. To Pompeius' death \n Thus Fortune called them: and a world in arms \n Witnessed his ruin. From where Afric's god, \n Two-horned Ammon, rears his temple, came \n All Libya ceaseless, from the wastes that touch \n The bounds of Egypt to the shore that meets \n The Western Ocean. Thus, to award the prize \n Of Empire at one blow, Pharsalia brought \n 'Neath Caesar's conquering hand the banded world.\n \n \n Now Caesar left the walls of trembling Rome \n \n And swift across the cloudy Alpine tops \n He winged his march; but while all others fled \n Far from his path, in terror of his name, \n \n Phocaea 's manhood with un-Grecian faith \n Held to their pledged obedience, and dared \n To follow right, not fate; but first of all \n With olive boughs of truce before them borne \n The chieftain they approach, with peaceful words \n In hope to alter his unbending will \n And tame his fury. 'Search the ancient books \n Which chronicle the deeds of Latian fame; \n Thou'lt ever find, when foreign foes pressed hard, \n \n Massilia 's prowess on the side of Rome . \n \n And now, if triumphs in an unknown world \n Thou seekest, Caesar, here our arms and swords \n Accept in aid: but if, in impious strife \n Of civil discord, with a Roman foe \n Thou arm'st for battle, tears we give thee then \n And hold aloof: no stranger hand may touch \n Celestial wounds. Should all Olympus ' hosts \n Have rushed to war, or should the giant brood \n Assault the stars, yet men would not presume \n Or by their prayers or arms to help the gods: \n And, ignorant of the fortunes of the sky, \n Taught by the thunderbolts alone, would know \n That Jupiter supreme still held the throne. \n Add that unnumbered nations join the fray: \n Nor shrinks the world so much from taint of crime \n That civil wars reluctant swords require. \n But grant that strangers shun thy destinies \n And only Romans fight-shall not the son \n Shrink ere he strike his father? on both sides \n Brothers forbid the weapon to be hurled? \n The world's end comes when other hands are armed \n ' Than those which custom and the gods allow. \n ' For us, this is our prayer: Leave, Caesar, here \n ' Thy dreadful eagles, keep thy hostile signs \n ' Back from our gates, but enter thou in peace \n ' Massilia 's ramparts; let our city rest \n ' Withdrawn from crime, to Magnus and to thee \n ' Safe: and should favouring fate preserve our walls \n ' Inviolate, when both shall wish for peace \n ' Here meet unarmed. Why hither dost thou turn \n ' Thy rapid march, when to Iberian fights \n 'The war commands thee? Weight nor power have we \n ' To sway the mighty conflicts of the world. \n ' We boast no victories since our fatherland \n 'We left in exile: when Phocaea 's fort \n ' Perished in flames, we sought another here; \n 'And here on foreign shores, in narrow bounds \n ' Confined and safe, our boast is sturdy faith; \n ' Nought else. But if our city to blockade \n ' Is now thy mind-to force the gates, and hurl \n ' Javelin and blazing torch upon our homes- \n ' Do what thou wilt: cut off the source that fills \n ' Our foaming river, force us, prone in thirst, \n ' To dig the earth and lap the scanty pool; \n ' Seize on our corn and leave us food abhorred: \n ' This people shall not shun, for freedom's sake, \n ' The ills Saguntum bore in Punic siege; \n \n ' Torn, vainly clinging, from the shrunken breast \n ' The starving babe shall perish in the flames. \n ' Wives at their husbands' hands shall pray their fate, \n ' And brothers' weapons deal a mutual death. \n ' Such be our civil war; not, Caesar, thine.' \n But Caesar's visage stern betrayed his ire \n Which thus broke forth in words: ' Vain is the hope \n Ye rest upon my march: speed though I may \n Towards my western goal, time still remains \n To blot Massilia out. Rejoice, my troops! \n ' Unsought the war ye longed for meets you now: \n The fates concede it. As the tempests lose \n Their strength by sturdy forests unopposed, \n And as the fire that finds no fuel dies, \n Even so to find no foe is Caesar's ill. \n When those who may be conquered will not fight, \n That is defeat. Degenerate, disarmed \n Their gates admit me! Not content, forsooth, \n With shutting Caesar out they shut him in! \n They shun the taint of war! Such prayer for peace \n Brings with it chastisement. In Caesar's age \n Learn that not peace, but war within his ranks \n Alone can make you safe.' \n He turns his march \n Upon the fearless city, and beholds \n Fast barred the gate-ways, while in arms the youths \n Stand on the battlements. Hard by the walls \n A hillock rose, upon the further side \n Expanding in a plain of gentle slope, \n Fit (as he deemed it) for a camp with ditch \n And mound encircling. To a lofty height \n The nearest portion of the city rose, \n While intervening valleys lay between. \n These summits with a mighty trench to bind \n The chief resolves, gigantic though the toil. \n But first, from furthest boundaries of his camp, \n Enclosing streams and meadows, to the sea \n To draw a rampart, upon either hand \n Heaved up with earthy sod; with lofty towers \n Crowned; and to shut Massilia from the land. \n Then did the Grecian city win renown \n Eternal, deathless, for that uncompelled \n Nor fearing for herself, but free to act \n She made the conqueror pause: and he who seized \n All in resistless course found here delay: \n And Fortune, hastening to lay the world \n Low at her favourite's feet, was forced to stay \n For these few moments her impatient hand. \n Now fell the forests far and wide, despoiled \n Of all their giant trunks: for as the mound \n On earth and brushwood stood, a timber frame \n Held firm the soil, lest pressed beneath its towers \n The mass might topple down.\n \n \n There stood a grove \n Which from the earliest time no hand of man \n Had dared to violate; hidden from the sun \n \n Its chill recesses; matted boughs entwined \n Prisoned the air within. No sylvan nymphs \n Here found a home, nor Pan, but savage rites \n And barbarous worship, altars horrible \n On massive stones upreared; sacred with blood \n Of men was every tree. If faith be given \n To ancient myth, no fowl has ever dared \n To rest upon those branches, and no beast \n Has made his lair beneath: no tempest falls, \n Nor lightnings flash upon it from the cloud. \n Stagnant the air, unmoving, yet the leaves \n Filled with mysterious trembling; dripped the streams \n From coal-black fountains; effigies of gods \n Rude, scarcely fashioned from some fallen trunk \n Held the mid space: and, pallid with decay, \n Their rotting shapes struck terror. Thus do men \n Dread most the god unknown. 'Twas said that caves \n Rumbled with earthquakes, that the prostrate yew \n Rose up again; that fiery tongues of flame \n Gleamed in the forest depths, yet were the trees \n Unkindled; and that snakes in frequent folds \n Were coiled around the trunks. Men flee the spot \n Nor dare to worship near: and e'en the priest \n Or when bright Phoebus holds the height, or when \n Dark night controls the heavens, in anxious dread \n Draws near the grove and fears to find its lord. \n Spared in the former war, still dense it rose \n Where all the hills were bare, and Caesar now \n Its fall commanded. But the brawny arms \n Which swayed the axes trembled, and the men, \n Awed by the sacred grove's dark majesty, \n Held back the blow they thought would be returned. \n This Caesar saw, and swift within his grasp \n Uprose a ponderous axe, which downward fell \n Cleaving a mighty oak that towered to heaven, \n While thus he spake: ' Henceforth let no man dread \n 'To fell this forest : all the crime is mine. \n 'This be your creed.' He spake, and all obeyed, \n For Caesar's ire weighed down the wrath of Heaven. \n Yet ceased they not to fear. Then first the oak, \n \n Dodona 's ancient boast; the knotty holm; \n The cypress, witness of patrician grief, \n The buoyant alder, laid their foliage low \n Admitting day; though scarcely through the stems \n Their fall found passage. At the sight the Gauls \n Grieved; but the garrison within the walls \n Rejoiced: for thus shall men insult the gods \n And find no punishment? Yet fortune oft \n Protects the guilty; on the poor alone \n The gods can vent their ire. Enough hewn down, \n They seize the country wagons; and the hind, \n His oxen gone which else had drawn the plough, \n Mourns for his harvest. \n But the eager chief \n Impatient of the combat by the walls \n Carries the warfare to the furthest west. \n Meanwhile a giant mound, on star-shaped wheels \n Concealed, they fashion, crowned with double towers \n High as the battlements, by cause unseen \n Slow creeping onwards; while amazed the foe \n Beheld, and thought some subterranean gust \n Had burst the caverns of the earth and forced \n The nodding pile aloft, and wondered sore \n Their walls should stand unshaken. From its height \n Hissed down the weapons; but the Grecian bolts \n WVith greater force were on the Romans hurled; \n Nor by the arm unaided, for the lance \n Urged by the catapult resistless rushed \n Through arms and shield and flesh, and left a death \n Behind, nor stayed its course : and massive stones \n Cast by the beams of mighty engines fell; \n As from the mountain top some time-worn rock \n At length by winds dislodged, in all its track \n Spreads ruin vast: nor crushed the life alone \n Forth from the body, but dispersed the limbs \n In fragments undistinguished and in blood. \n But as protected by the armour shield \n The might of Rome drew nigh beneath the wall \n (The front rank with their bucklers interlaced \n And held above their helms), the missiles fell \n Behind their backs, nor could the toiling Greeks \n Deflect their engines, throwing still the bolts \n Far into space; but from the rampart top \n Flung ponderous masses down. Long as the shields \n Held firm together, like to hail that falls \n Harmless upon a roof, so long the stones \n Crushed down innocuous; but as the blows \n Rained fierce and ceaseless and the Romans tired, \n Some here and there sank fainting. Next the roof \n Moves on with earth besprinkled: underneath \n The ram conceals his head, which, poised and swung, \n They dash with mighty force upon the wall, \n Covered themselves with mantlets. Though the head \n Light on the lower stones, yet as the shock \n Falls and refalls, from battlement to base \n The rampart soon shall topple. But by balks \n And rocky fragments overwhelmed, and flames, \n The roof at length gives way; and worn with toil \n All spent in vain, the wearied troops withdraw \n And seek the shelter of their tents again. \n Thus far to hold their battlements was all \n The Greeks had hoped; now, venturing attack, \n With glittering torches for their arms, by night \n Fearless they sallied forth: nor lance they bear \n Nor deadly bow, nor shaft; for fire alone \n Is now their weapon. Through the Roman works \n Driven by the wind the conflagration spread: \n Nor did the newness of the wood make pause \n The fury of the flames, which, fed afresh \n By living torches, 'neath a smoky pall \n Leaped on in fiery tongues. Not wood alone \n But stones gigantic crumbling into dust \n Dissolved beneath the heat; the mighty mound \n Lay prone, yet in its ruin larger seemed.\n \n \n Next, conquered on the land, upon the main \n They try their fortunes. On their simple craft \n No painted figure-head adorned the bows \n Nor claimed protection from the gods; but rude, \n Just as they fell upon their mountain homes, \n The trees were knit together, and the deck \n Gave steady foot-hold for an ocean fight. \n Meanwhile had Caesar's squadron left the Rhone \n \n And reached with Brutus' turret ship the strait \n By Stoechas' isles. Nor less the Grecian host- \n Boys not yet grown to war, and aged men, \n Armed for the conflict, with their all at stake. \n Nor only did they marshal for the fight \n Ships meet for service; but their ancient keels \n Brought from the dockyards. When the morning rays \n Broke from the waters, and the sky was clear, \n And all the winds were still upon the deep, \n Smoothed for the battle, swift on either part \n The fleets essay the open; and the ships \n Tremble beneath the oars that urge them on, \n By sinewy arms impelled. Upon the wings \n That bound the Roman fleet, the larger craft \n With triple and quadruple banks of oars \n Gird in the lesser: so they front the sea; \n While in their rear, shaped as a crescent moon, \n Liburnian galleys follow. Over all \n Towers Brutus' deck praetorian. Oars on oars \n Propel the bulky vessel through the main, \n Six ranks; the topmost strike the waves afar. \n When such a space remained between the fleets \n As could be covered by a single stroke, \n Innumerable voices rise in air \n Drowning with resonant din the beat of oars \n And note of trumpet summoning: and all \n Sit on the benches and with mighty stroke \n Sweep o'er the sea and gain the space between. \n Then crashed the prows together, and the keels \n Rebounded backwards, and unnumbered darts \n Or darkened all the sky or, in their fall, \n The vacant ocean. As the wings grew wide, \n Less densely packed the fleet, some Grecian ships \n Pressed in between; as when with west and east \n The tide contends, this way the waves are driven \n And that the sea; so as they plough the deep \n In various lines converging, what the prow \n Throws up advancing, from the foemen's oars \n Falls back repelled. But soon the Grecian fleet \n Was handier found in battle, and in flight \n Pretended, and in shorter curves could round; \n More deftly governed by the guiding helm : \n While on the Roman side their steadier keels \n Gave vantage, as to men who fight on land. \n Then Brutus to the pilot of his ship: \n ' Dost suffer them to range the wider deep, \n 'Contending with the foe in naval skill? \n ' Draw close the war and drive us on the prows \n 'Of these Phocaeans.' Him the pilot heard; \n And turned his vessel slantwise to the foe. \n Then was the sea all covered with the war: \n Then Grecian ships attacking Brutus found \n Their ruin in the stroke, and vanquished lay \n Beside his bulwarks; with curved hooks and chains \n The foe they grapple, by entangled oars \n Themselves held back. And now no outstretched arm \n Hurls forth the javelin, but sword in hand \n They wage a naval fight: each from his ship \n Leans forward to the stroke, and falls when slain \n Upon a foeman's deck. Deep flows the stream \n Of purple slaughter to the foamy main : \n By piles of floating corpses are the sides, \n Though grappled, kept asunder. Some, half dead, \n Plunge in the ocean, gulping down the brine \n Encrimsoned with their blood; some lingering still \n Draw their last struggling breath amid the wreck \n Of broken navies: weapons which have missed \n Find yet their victims, and the falling steel \n Fails not in middle deep to deal the wound. \n One vessel circled by Phocaean keels \n Divides her strength, and on the right and left \n On either side with equal war contends; \n On whose high poop while Tagus fighting gripped \n The stern Phocaean, pierced his back and breast \n Two fatal weapons; in the midst the steel \n Met, and the blood, uncertain whence to flow, \n Stood still, arrested, till with double course \n Forth by a sudden gush it drove each dart, \n And sent the life abroad through either wound. \n Here fated Telon also steered his ship: \n No pilot's hand upon an angry sea \n More deftly ruled a vessel. Well he knew, \n Or by the sun or crescent moon, how best \n To set his canvas fitted for the breeze \n The coming hours would bring. His rushing stem \n Shattered a Roman vessel: but a dart \n Hurled at the moment quivered in his breast. \n He falls, and in the fall his dying hand \n Diverts the prow. Then Gyareus, in act \n To climb the friendly deck, by javelin pierced, \n Still as he hung, by the retaining steel \n Fast to the side was nailed. \n Twin brethren stand \n A fruitful mother's pride; with different fates, \n But ne'er distinguished till death's savage hand \n Struck once, and ended error: he that lived, \n Cause of fresh anguish to their sorrowing souls, \n Called ever to the weeping parents back \n The image of the lost: who, as the oars \n Grecian and Roman mixed their teeth oblique, \n Grasped with his dexter hand the Roman ship; \n When fell a blow that shore his arm away. \n So died, upon the side it held, the hand, \n Nor loosed its grasp in death. Yet with the wound \n His noble courage rose, and maimed he dared \n Renew the fray, and stretched across the sea \n To grasp the lost-in vain! another blow \n Lopped arm and hand alike. Nor shield nor sword \n Henceforth are his. Yet even now he seeks \n No sheltering hold, but with his chest advanced \n Before his brother armed, he claims the fight, \n And holding in his breast the darts which else \n Had slain his comrades, pierced with countless spears, \n He falls in death well earned; yet ere his end \n Collects his parting life, and all his strength \n Strains to the utmost and with failing limbs \n Leaps on the foeman's deck; by weight alone \n Injurious; for streaming down with gore \n And piled on high with corpses, while her sides \n Sounded to ceaseless blows, the fated ship \n Let in the greedy brine until her ways \n Were level with the waters-then she plunged \n In whirling eddies downwards-and the main \n First parted, then closed in upon its prey. \n Full many wondrous deaths, with fates diverse, \n Upon the sea in that day's fight befell.\n \n \n Caught by a grappling-hook that missed the side, \n Had Lycidas been whelmed in middle deep; \n But by his feet his comrades dragged him back, \n And rent in twain he hung; nor slowly flowed \n As from a wound the blood; but all his veins \n \n Were torn asunder and the stream of life \n Gushed o'er his limbs till lost amid the waves. \n From no man dying has the vital breath \n Rushed by so wide a path; the lower trunk \n Succumbed to death, but with the lungs and heart \n Long strove the fates, and hardly won the whole. \n While, bent upon the fight, an eager crew \n Were gathered to the margin of their deck \n (Leaving the upper side as bare of foes), \n Their ship was overset. Beneath the keel \n Which floated upwards, prisoned in the sea, \n And powerless by spread of arms to float \n The main, they perished. One who haply swam \n Amid the battle, chanced upon a death \n Strange and unheard of; for two meeting prows \n Transfixed his body. At the double stroke \n Wide yawns his chest; blood issues from his mouth \n With flesh commingled; and the brazen beaks \n Resounding clash together, by the bones \n Unhindered: now they part and through the gap \n Swift pours the sea and drags the corse below. \n Next, of a shipwrecked crew, the larger part \n Struggling with death upon the waters, reached \n A comrade bark; but when with elbows raised \n They seized upon the bulwarks and the ship \n Rolled, nor could bear their weight, the ruthless crew \n Hacked off their straining arms; then maimed they sank \n Below the seething waves, to rise no more. \n Now every dart was hurled and every spear, \n The soldier weaponless; yet their rage found arms: \n One hurls an oar; another's brawny arm \n Tugs at the twisted stern; or from the seats \n The oarsmen driving, swings a bench in air. \n The ships are broken for the fight. They seize \n The fallen dead and snatch the sword that slew. \n Nay, many from their wounds, frenzied for arms, \n Pluck forth the deadly steel, and pressing still \n Upon their yawning sides, hurl forth the spear \n Back to the hostile ranks from which it came; \n Then ebbs their life blood forth. \n But deadlier yet \n Was that fell force most hostile to the sea; \n For, thrown in torches and in sulphurous bolts \n Fire all-consuming ran among the ships, \n Whose oily timbers soaked in pitch and wax \n Inflammable, gave welcome to the flames. \n Nor could the waves prevail against the blaze \n Which claimed as for its own the fragments borne \n Upon the waters. Lo! on burning plank \n One hardly 'scapes destruction; one to save \n His flaming ship, gives entrance to the main. \n Of all the forms of death each fears the one \n That brings immediate dying: yet quail not \n Their hearts in shipwreck : from the waves they pluck \n The fallen darts and furnishing the ships \n Essay the feeble stroke; and should that hope \n Still fail their hand, they call the sea to aid \n And seizing in their grasp some floating foe \n Drag him to mutual death. But on that day \n Phoceus above all others proved his skill. \n Well trained was he to dive beneath the main \n And search the waters with unfailing eye; \n And should an anchor 'gainst the straining rope \n Too firmly bite the sands, to wrench it free. \n Oft in his fatal grasp he seized a foe \n Nor loosed his grip until the life was gone. \n Such was his frequent deed; but this his fate: \n For rising, victor (as he thought), to air, \n Full on a keel he struck and found his death. \n Some, drowning, seized a hostile oar and checked \n The flying vessel; not to die in vain, \n Their single care; some on their vessel's side \n Hanging, in death, with wounded frame essayed \n To check the charging prow. Tyrrhenus high \n Upon the bulwarks of his ship was struck \n By leaden bolt from Balearic sling \n Of Lygdamus; straight through his temples passed \n The fated missile; and in streams of blood \n Forced from their seats his trembling eyeballs fell. \n Plunged in a darkness as of night, he thought \n That life had left him; yet ere long he knew \n The living vigour of his limbs; and cried, \n 'Place me, O friends, as some machine of war \n Straight facing towards the foe; then shall my darts \n Strike as of old; and thou, Tyrrhenus, spend \n Thy latest breath, still left, upon the fight: \n So shalt thou play, not wholly dead, the part \n That fits a soldier, and the spear that strikes \n Thy frame, shall miss the living.' Thus he spake, \n And hurled his javelin, blind, but not in vain; \n For Argus, generous youth of noble blood, \n Below the middle waist received the spear \n And falling drave it home. His aged sire \n From furthest portion of the conquered ship \n Beheld; than whom in pride of manhood none \n More brave in battle: now no more he fought, \n Yet did the memory of his prowess stir \n Phocaean youths to emulate his fame. \n Oft stumbling o'er the benches the old man hastes \n To reach his boy, and finds him breathing still. \n No tear bedewed his cheek; upon his breast \n No blow he struck; but all his frame was stiff, \n His hands outspread : and o'er his eyes there fell \n A dark impenetrable veil of mist \n That blotted out the day; nor could he more \n Discern his luckless Argus. He, who saw \n His parent, raising up his drooping head \n With parted lips and silent features asks \n A father's latest kiss, a father's hand \n To close his dying eyes. But soon his sire, \n Recovering from his swoon, when ruthless grief \n Possessed his spirit, 'This short space,' he cried, \n ' I lose not, which the cruel gods have given, \n ' But die before thee. Grant thy sorrowing sire \n ' Forgiveness that he fled thy last embrace. \n Not yet has passed thy life blood from the wound \n Nor yet is death upon thee-still thou may'st \n \n Outlive thy parent.' Thus he spake, and seized \n The reeking sword and drave it to the hilt, \n Then plunged into the deep, with headlong bound, \n To anticipate his son: for this he feared \n A single form of death should not suffice. \n Now gave the fates their judgment, and in doubt \n No longer was the war: the Grecian fleet \n In most part sunk; -some ships by Romans oared \n Conveyed the victors home: in headlong flight \n Some sought the yards for shelter. On the strand \n What tears of parents for their offspring slain, \n How wept the mothers! 'Mid the pile confused \n Ofttimes the wife sought madly for her spouse \n And chose for her last kiss some Roman slain; \n While wretched fathers by the blazing pyres \n Fought for the dead. But Brutus thus at sea \n First gained a triumph for great Caesar's arms. \n \n "

There on Magnus' side \n Afranius and Petreius held command, \n Who ruled alternate, and the rampart guard \n Obeyed the standard of each chief in turn. \n There with the Romans in the camp were joined \n Asturians swift, and Vettons lightly armed, \n And Celts who, exiled from their ancient home, \n Had joined ' Iberus ' to their former name. \n Where the rich soil in gentle slope ascends \n And forms a modest hill, Ilerda \n stands, \n Founded in ancient days; beside her glides \n Not least of western rivers, Sicoris \n Of placid current, by a mighty arch \n Of stone o'erspanned, which not the winter floods \n Shall overwhelm. Upon a rock hard by \n Was Magnus' camp; but Caesar's on a hill, \n Rivalling the first; and in the midst a stream. \n Here boundless plains are spread beyond the range \n Of human vision; Cinga girds them in \n With greedy waves; forbidden to contend \n With tides of ocean; for that larger flood \n Who names the land, Iberus , sweeps along \n The lesser stream commingled with his own. \n Guiltless of war, the first day saw the hosts \n In long array confronted; standard rose \n Opposing standard, numberless; yet none \n Attacked, through shame of strife; one bloodless day \n They gave their country and her broken laws. \n But Caesar, when from heaven fell the night, \n Drew round a hasty trench; his foremost rank \n With close array concealing those who wrought. \n Then with the morn he bids them seize the hill \n Which parted from the camp Ilerda 's walls, \n And gave them safety. But in fear and shame \n On rushed the foe and seized the vantage ground, \n First in the onset. From the height they held \n Their hopes of conquest; but to Caesar's men \n Their hearts by courage stirred, and their good swords \n Promised the victory. Burdened up the ridge \n The soldier climbed, and from the opposing steep \n But for his comrade's shield had fallen back; \n None had the space to hurl the quivering lance \n Upon the foeman: spear and pike made sure \n The failing foothold, and the falchion's edge \n Hewed out their upward path. But Caesar saw \n Ruin impending, and he bade his horse \n By circuit to the left, with shielded flank, \n Hold back the foe. Thus gained his troops retreat, \n For none pressed on them; and the victor chiefs, \n Forced to withdrawal, gained the day in vain. \n Henceforth the fitful changes of the year \n Governed the fates and fashioned out the war. \n For stubborn frost still lay upon the land, \n And northern winds, controlling all the sky, \n Prisoned the rain in clouds; the hills were nipped \n With snow unmelted, and the lower plains \n By frosts that fled before the rising sun; \n And all the land, there nearer to the sky \n That whelms the stars, was hard and arid grown \n By suns of winter. But when Titan neared \n The Ram, who, backward gazing on the stars, \n Bore perished Helle, and the hours were held \n In balance, and the days again prevailed, \n The earliest faded moon which in the vault \n Hung with uncertain horn, from eastern wind \n Received a fiery radiance; whose blast \n Forced Boreas back: and breaking on the mists \n Within his regions, to the Occident \n Drave all that shroud Arabia and the land \n Of Ganges; all that or by Caurus borne \n Bedim the Orient sky, or rising suns \n Permit to gather; pitiless flamed the day \n Behind them, while in front the wide expanse \n Was driven; nor on mid earth sank the clouds \n Though weighed with vapour. North and south alike \n Were showerless, for on Calpe 's rock alone \n All moisture gathered; here at last, forbidden \n To pass that sea by Zephyr's bounds contained, \n And by the furthest belt of heaven, they pause, \n In masses huge convolved; the widest breadth \n Of murky air scarce holds them, which divides \n Earth from the heavens; till pressed by weight of sky \n In densest volume to the earth they pour \n Their cataracts; no lightning could endure \n Such storm unquenched: though oft athwart the gloom \n Gleamed its pale fire. Meanwhile a watery arch \n Scarce touched with colour, in imperfect shape \n Embraced the sky and drank the ocean waves, \n So rendering to the clouds their flood outpoured. \n And now the snows which Titan never yet \n Could melt were thawed: the Pyrenaean rocks \n Are wet with flowing ice; accustomed springs \n Find not discharge; and from the very banks \n Each stream receives a torrent. Caesar's arms \n Are shipwrecked on the field, his tottering camp \n Swims on the rising flood; the trench is filled \n With whirling waters; and the plain no more \n Yields corn or kine; for those who forage seek, \n Err from the hidden furrow. Famine knocks \n (First herald of o'erwhelming ills to come) \n Fierce at the door; and while no foe blockades \n The soldier hungers; fortunes buy not now \n The meanest measure; yet, alas! is found \n The fasting peasant, who, in gain of gold, \n Will sell his little all! And now the hills \n Are seen no more; rivers in one vast sea \n Of whirlpools overwhelmed; beasts borne away \n And sucked beneath the stream; their rocky dens \n Sweep onwards; and the torrent's raging force \n Bears back the inflowing ocean. Nor does night \n Acknowledge Phoebus' rise, for all the sky \n Feels her dominion and obscures its face, \n And darkness joins with darkness. Thus doth lie \n The lowest earth beneath the snowy zone \n And never-ending winters, where the sky \n Is starless ever, and no growth of herb \n Sprouts from the frozen earth; but standing ice \n Tempers the stars which in the middle zone \n Kindle their flames. Thus, Father of the world, \n And thou, O trident-god who rul'st the sea \n Second in place, Neptunus, load the air \n With clouds continual; forbid the tide, \n Once risen, to return : forced by thy waves \n Let rivers backward run in different course, \n Thy shores no longer reaching; and the earth, \n Shaken, make way for floods. Let Rhine o'erflow \n And Rhone their banks; let torrents spread afield \n Unmeasured waters: melt Rhipaean snows: \n Spread lakes upon the land, and seas profound, \n And snatch the groaning world from civil war.\n \n \n Thus for a little moment Fortune tried \n Her darling son; then smiling to his part \n Returned; and gained her pardon for the past \n By greater gifts to come. For now the air \n Had grown more clear, and Phoebus' warmer rays \n Coped with the flood and scattered all the clouds \n In fleecy masses; and the reddening east \n Proclaimed the coming day; the land resumed \n Its ancient marks; no more in middle air \n The moisture hung, but from about the stars \n Sank to the depths; the forest glad upreared \n Its foliage; hills again emerged to view \n And 'neath the warmth of day the plains grew firm. \n When Sicoris kept his banks, the shallop light \n Of hoary willow bark they build, which bent \n On hides of oxen, bears the weight of man \n And swims the torrent. Thus on sluggish Po \n Venetians float; and on th' encircling sea \n \n Are borne Britannia 's nations; and when Nile \n \n Fills all the land, are Memphis ' thirsty reeds \n Shaped into fragile boats that swim his waves. \n The further bank thus gained, they haste to curve \n The fallen forest, and to form the arch \n By which imperious Sicoris shall be spanned. \n Yet fearing he might rise in wrath anew, \n Not on the nearest marge they place the beams, \n But in mid-field. Thus the presumptuous stream \n They tame with chastisement, parting his flood \n In devious channels out; and curb his pride. \n Petreius, seeing that all things gave way \n To Caesar's destiny, leaves Ilerda 's steep, \n His trust no longer in the Roman world; \n And seeks for strength amid those distant tribes, \n Who, loving death, rush in upon the foe, \n \n And win their conquests at the point of sword. \n But in the dawn, when Caesar saw the camp \n Stand empty on the hill, ' To arms! ' he cries: \n ' No bridge nor ford; but stem with brawny arms \n ' The foaming river.' Rushing to the fray \n They dare the torrent they had feared in flight. \n Their arms regained, they race until the blood \n Throbs in their veins anew, and their wet limbs \n Are warm again. At length the shadows fall \n Short on the sward, and day is at the height. \n Then dash the horsemen on, and hold the foe \n 'Twixt flight and battle. In the plain arose \n Two rocky heights: from each a loftier ridge \n Of hills ranged onwards, sheltering in their midst \n A hollow vale, whose deep and winding paths \n Were safe from warfare; which, when Caesar saw \n That if Petreius held, the war must pass \n To lands remote by savage tribes possessed; \n 'Speed on,' he cries, ' and meet their flight in front; \n 'Fierce be your frown and battle in your glance: \n ' No coward's death be theirs; but as they flee \n 'Plunge in their breasts the sword.' They seize the pass \n And place their camp. Short was the span between \n Th' opposing sentinels; with eager eyes \n Undimmed by space, they gazed on brothers, sons, \n Or friends and fathers; and within their souls \n They grasped the impious horror of the war. \n \n Yet for a little while no voice was heard, \n For fear restrained; by waving blade alone \n Or gesture, spake they; but their passion grew, \n And broke all discipline; and soon they leap \n The hostile rampart; every hand outstretched \n Embraces hand of foeman, palm in palm; \n One calls by name his neighbour, one his host, \n Another with his schoolmate talks again \n Of olden studies: he who in the camp \n Found not a comrade, was no son of Rome . \n Wet are their arms with tears, and sobs break in \n Upon their kisses; each, unstained by blood, \n Dreads what he might have done. Why beat thy breast? \n Why, madman, weep? The guilt is thine alone \n To do or to abstain. Dost fear the man \n Who takes his title to be feared from thee? \n When Caesar's trumpets sound the call to arms \n Heed not the summons; when thou seest advance \n His standards, halt. The civil Fury thus \n Shall fold her wings; and in a private robe \n Caesar shall love his kinsman. \n Holy Love \n Who sway'st the universe, whose firm embrace \n Binds the compacted fabric of the world; \n Come, gentle Concord! these our times do now \n For good or evil destiny control \n The coming centuries! Ah, cruel fate! \n Now have the people lost their cloak for crime: \n Their hope of pardon. They have known their kin. \n Woe for the respite given by the gods \n Making more black the hideous guilt to come! \n Now all was peaceful, and in either camp \n Sweet converse held the soldiers; on the grass \n They place the meal, and pour the mingled cup; \n Bright glows the turf upon the friendly fire; \n On mutual couch with stories of their fights, \n They while the sleepless hours in talk away; \n 'Where stood the ranks arrayed, from whose right hand \n The quivering lance was sped:' and while they boast, \n Or challenge, deeds of prowess in the war, \n Faith is renewed and trust. Thus envious fate \n Made worse their doom, and all the crimes to be \n Grew with their love. For when Petreius knew \n The treaties made, himself and all his camp \n Sold to the foe, he stirred his guard to work \n An impious slaughter: the defenceless foe \n Flung headlong forth: and parted fond embrace \n By stroke of weapon and in streams of blood. \n And thus in words of wrath, to stir the war: \n 'Of Rome forgetful, to your faith forsworn! \n 'And could ye not with victory gained return, \n 'Restorers of her liberty, to Rome? \n 'Lose then! but losing call not Caesar lord. \n 'While still your swords are yours, with blood to shed \n 'In doubtful battle, while the fates are hid, \n 'Will you like cravens to your master bear \n 'Doomed eagles? Will you ask upon your knees \n 'That Caesar deign to treat his slaves alike, \n 'And spare, forsooth, like yours, your leaders' lives? \n \n 'Nay! never shall our safety be the price \n 'Of base betrayal! Not for boon of life \n 'We wage a civil war. This name of peace \n 'Drags us to slavery. Ne'er from depths of earth, \n 'Fain to withdraw her wealth, should toiling men \n 'Draw store of iron; ne'er entrench a town; \n 'Ne'er should the war-horse dash into the fray \n 'Nor fleet with turret bulwarks breast the main, \n If freedom ever could for peace be sold, \n And fame unsoiled: 'tis true our foes are sworn \n To cursed crime; should you whose cause is just, \n And who may hope for pardon in defeat, \n Hold cheap your honour? Shame upon your peace! \n Thou callest, Magnus, ignorant of fate, \n From all the world thy powers, and dost entreat \n Monarchs of distant realms, while haply here \n We in our treaties bargain for thy-life! ' \n Thus did he stir their minds and rouse anew \n The love of impious battle. So when beasts \n Grown strange to forests, long confined in dens, \n Their fierceness lose, and learn to bear with man; \n Once should they taste of blood, their thirsty jaws \n Swell at the touch, and all the ancient rage \n Comes back upon them till they hardly spare \n Their keeper. Thus they rush on every crime: \n And blows which dealt in blindness of affray \n Might seem the crimes of chance, or of the gods \n Wreaking their hate, such recent vows of love \n Made monstrous, horrid. Where they lately spread \n The mutual couch and banquet, and embraced \n Some new-found friend, now falls the fatal blow \n Upon the self-same breast; and though at first \n Groaning at the fell chance, they drew the sword; \n Hate rises as they strike, the murderous arm \n Confirms the doubtful will: in dreadful joy \n Through the wild camp they smote their kinsmen down; \n And carnage raged unchecked; and each man strove, \n Proud of his crime, before his leader's face \n To prove his shamelessness of guilt.\n \n \n But thou, \n Caesar, though losing of thy best, dost know \n The gods do favour thee. Thessalian fields \n Gave thee no better fortune, nor the waves \n That lave Massilia ; nor on Pharos' main \n Didst thou so triumph. By this crime alone \n Thou from this moment of the better cause \n Shalt be the Captain. \n Since the troops were stained \n With foulest slaughter thus, their leaders shunned \n All camps with Caesar's joined, and sought again \n \n Ilerda 's lofty walls; but Caesar's horse \n Seized on the plain and forced them to the hills \n Reluctant. There by steepest trench shut in, \n He cuts them from the river, nor permits \n Their circling ramparts to enclose a spring. \n By this dread path Death trapped his captive prey. \n Which when they knew, fierce anger filled their souls, \n And took the place of fear. They slew the steeds \n Now useless grown, and rushed upon their fate; \n Hopeless of life and flight. But Caesar cried: \n Hold back your weapons, soldiers, from the foe, \n Strike not the breast advancing; let the war \n ' Cost me no blood; he falls not without price \n ' Who with his life-blood challenges the fray. \n Scorning their own base lives and hating light, \n To Caesar's loss they rush upon their death, \n Nor heed our blows. But let this frenzy pass, \n This madman onset; let the wish for death \n Die in their souls.' Thus to its embers shrank \n The fire within, when battle was denied, \n And fainter grew their rage until the night \n Drew down her starry veil and sank the sun. \n Thus keener fights the gladiator whose wound \n Is recent, while the blood within the veins \n Still gives the sinews motion, ere the skin \n Shrinks on the bones: but as the victor stands \n His fatal thrust achieved, and points the blade \n Unfaltering, watching for the end, there creeps \n Torpor upon the limbs, the blood congeals \n About the gash, more faintly throbs the heart, \n And slowly fading, ebbs the life away. \n Raving for water now they dig the plain \n Seeking for hidden fountains, not with spade \n And mattock only searching out the depths, \n But with the sword; they hack the stony heights, \n In shafts that reach the level of the plain. \n No further flees from light the pallid wretch \n Who tears the bowels of the earth for gold. \n Yet neither riven stones revealed a spring, \n Nor streamlet whispered from its hidden source; \n No water trickled on the gravel bed, \n Nor dripped within the cavern. Worn at length \n With labour huge, they crawl to light again, \n After such toil to fall to thirst and heat \n The readier victims: this was all they won. \n All food they loathe; and 'gainst their deadly thirst \n Call famine to their aid. Damp clods of earth \n They squeeze upon their mouths with straining hands. \n Wherever on foulest mud some stagnant slime \n Or moisture lies, each dying soldier strives \n With dying comrade first to lap the draught, \n Loathsome had life been his. Like beasts they drain \n The swollen udder, and where milk was not, \n They suck the life-blood forth. From herbs and boughs \n Dripping with dew, from tender shoots they press, \n Nay, from the pith of trees, the juice within. \n Happy the host that onward marching finds \n Its savage enemy has fouled the wells \n With murderous venom; hadst thou, Caesar, cast \n The reeking filth of shambles in the stream, \n And henbane dire and all the poisonous herbs \n That lurk on Cretan slopes, still had they drunk \n The fatal waters, rather than endure \n Such lingering agony. Their bowels racked \n With torments as of flame; the swollen tongue \n And jaws now parched and rigid, and the veins; \n Each laboured breath with anguish from the lungs \n Enfeebled, moistureless, is scarcely drawn, \n And scarce again returned; and yet agape, \n Their panting mouths suck in the nightly dew; \n They watch for showers from heaven, and in despair \n Gaze on the clouds, whence lately poured a flood. \n Nor were their tortures less that Meroe \n \n Saw not their sufferings, nor Cancer's zone, \n Nor where the Garamantian turns the soil; \n But Sicoris and Iberus at their feet, \n Two mighty floods, but far beyond their reach, \n Rolled down in measureless volume to the main.\n \n \n But now their leaders yield; Afranius, \n Vanquished, throws down his arms, and leads his troops, \n Now hardly living, to the hostile camp \n Before the victor's feet, and sues for peace. \n Proud is his bearing, and despite of ills, \n His mien majestic, of his triumphs past \n Still mindful in disaster thus he stands, \n Though suppliant for grace, a leader yet; \n From fearless heart thus speaking: 'Had the fates \n Thrown me before some base ignoble foe, \n Not, Caesar, thee; still had this arm fought on \n And snatched my death. Now if I suppliant ask, \n 'Tis that I value still the boon of life \n Given by a worthy hand. No party ties \n 'Roused us to arms against thee; when the war, \n 'This civil war, broke out, it found us chiefs; \n And with our former cause we kept the faith, \n So long as brave men should. The fates' decree \n 'No longer we withstand. Unto thy will \n We yield the western tribes: the east is thine \n 'And all the world lies open to thy march. \n 'Be generous! blood nor sword nor wearied arm \n 'Thy conquests bought. Thou hast not to forgive \n Aught but thy victory won. Nor ask we much. \n 'Give us repose; to lead in peace the life \n 'Thou shalt bestow; suppose these armed lines \n 'Are corpses prostrate on the field of war, \n 'Ne'er were it meet that thy victorious ranks \n Should mix with ours, the vanquished. Destiny \n 'Has run for us its course: one boon I beg; \n 'Bid not the conquered conquer in thy train.' \n Such were his words, and Caesar's gracious smile \n Granted his prayer, remitting rights that war \n Gives to the victor. To th' unguarded stream \n The soldiers speed: prone on the bank they lie \n And lap the flood or foul the crowded waves. \n In many a burning throat the sudden draught \n Poured in too copious, filled the empty veins \n And choked the breath within: yet left unquenched \n The burning pest which, though their frames were full, \n Craved water for itself. Then, nerved once more, \n Their strength returned. Oh, lavish luxury, \n Contented never with the frugal meal! \n Oh, greed that searchest over land and sea \n To furnish forth the banquet! Pride that joy'st \n In sumptuous tables! learn what life requires, \n How little nature needs! No ruddy juice \n Pressed from the vintage in some famous year, \n Whose consuls are forgotten, served in cups \n With gold and jewels wrought, restores the spark, \n The failing spark, of life; but water pure \n And simplest fruits of earth. The flood, the field \n Suffice for nature. Ah! the weary lot \n Of those who war! But these, their armour laid \n Low at the victor's feet, with lightened breast, \n Secure themselves, no longer dealing death, \n Beset by care no more, seek out their homes. \n What priceless gift in peace had they secured! \n How grieved it now their souls to have poised the dart \n With arm outstretched; to have felt their raving thirst; \n And prayed the gods for victory in vain! \n Nay, hard they think the victor's lot, for whom \n A thousand risks and battles still remain; \n If fortune never is to leave his side, \n How often must he triumph! and how oft \n Pour out his blood where'er great Caesar leads! \n Happy, thrice happy, he who, when the world \n Is nodding to its ruin, knows the spot \n Where he himself shall, though in ruin, lie! \n No trumpet call shall break his sleep again: \n But in his humble home, with faithful spouse \n And sons unlettered, Fortune leaves him free \n From rage of party; for if life he owes \n To Caesar, Magnus sometime was his lord. \n Thus happy they alone live on apart, \n Nor hope nor dread the event of civil war.\n \n \n Not thus did Fortune upon Caesar smile \n In all the parts of earth; but 'gainst his arms \n Dared somewhat, where Salona 's lengthy waste \n Is laved by Hadria , and Iadar warm \n Meets with his waves the breezes of the west. \n There brave Curectae dwell, whose island home \n Is girded by the main; on whom relied \n Antonius, and, beleaguered by the foe, \n Upon the furthest margin of the shore \n (Safe from all ills but famine) placed his camp. \n But for his steeds the earth no forage gave, \n Nor golden Ceres harvest; and his troops \n Gnawed the dry herbage of the scanty turf \n Within their rampart lines. But when they knew \n That Basilus was on th' opposing shore \n With friendly force, by novel mode of flight \n They aim to reach him. Not the accustomed keel \n They lay, nor build the ship, but shapeless rafts \n Of timbers knit together, strong to bear \n All ponderous weight; on empty casks beneath \n By tightened chains made firm, in double rows \n Supported; nor upon the deck were placed \n The oarsmen, to the hostile dart exposed, \n But in a hidden space, by beams concealed. \n And thus the eye amazed beheld the mass \n Move silent on its path across the sea, \n By neither sail nor stalwart arm propelled. \n They watch the main until the refluent waves \n Ebb from the growing sands; then, on the tide \n Receding, launch their vessel; thus she floats \n With comrades twin: and rises over each \n With quivering battlements a lofty tower. \n Octavius, guardian of Illyrian seas, \n Restrained his swifter keels, and left the rafts \n Free from attack, in hope of larger spoil \n From fresh adventures; for the peaceful sea \n Might tempt them, and their goal in safety reached, \n To dare a second voyage. Round the stag \n Thus will the cunning hunter draw a line \n Of tainted feathers poisoning the air; \n Or spread the mesh, and muzzle in his grasp \n The straining jaws of the Molossian hound, \n And leash the Spartan pack; nor is the brake \n Trusted to any dog but such as tracks \n The scent with lowered nostrils, and refrains \n From giving tongue the while; content to mark \n By shaking cord the covert of the prey. \n Ere long they manned the rafts in eager wish \n To quit the island, when the latest glow \n Still parted day from night. But Magnus' troops, \n Cilician once, taught by their ancient art, \n In fraudulent deceit had left the sea \n To view unguarded; but with chains unseen \n Fast to Illyrian shores, and hanging loose, \n They blocked the outlet in the waves beneath. \n The leading rafts passed safely, but the third, \n Caught by the rope, was drawn beneath the rocks. \n These, hollowed by the sea, in ponderous mass \n O'erhanging, seemed upon the point to fall; \n And trees made dark the wave. Here oft the main \n Within the deep recess sweeps broken wrecks \n And bodies of the drowned, till ebbing tides \n Return the spoil. Then from the cavernous arch \n Is belched the ocean forth in such turmoil \n Of swirling billows, as excels the rage \n Of that famed whirlpool on Sicilian shores. \n Here, with Venetian settlers for its load, \n Stood motionless the raft. Octavius' ships \n Gathered around, while foemen on the land \n Filled all the shore. But well the captain knew, \n Volteius, how the secret fraud was planned, \n And tried in vain with sword and steel to burst \n The chains that held them; without hope he fights, \n Uncertain where to avoid or front the foe. \n Caught in the strait they strove as brave men should \n Against opposing hosts; nor long the fight, \n For fallen darkness brought a truce to arms. \n Then to his men disheartened and in fear \n Of coming fate Volteius, great of soul, \n Thus spake in tones commanding: ' Free no more, \n 'Save for this little night, consult ye now \n 'In this last moment, soldiers, how to face \n 'Your final fortunes. No man's life is short \n ' Who can take thought for death, nor is your fame \n ' Less than a conqueror's, if with breast advanced \n 'Ye meet your destined doom. None know how long \n 'The life that waits them. Summon your own fate, \n 'And equal is your praise, whether the hand \n 'Quench the last flicker of departing light, \n ' Or shear the hope of years. But choice to die \n 'Is thrust not on the mind-we cannot flee; \n 'See at our throats, e'en now, our kinsmen's swords. \n ' Then choose for death; desire what fate decrees. \n 'At least in war's blind cloud we shall not fall; \n ' Nor when the flying weapons hide the day, \n 'And slaughtered heaps of foemen load the field, \n 'And death is common, and the brave man sinks \n 'Unknown, inglorious. Us within this ship, \n 'Seen of both friends and foes, the gods have placed; \n 'Both land and sea and island cliffs shall bear, \n 'From either shore, their witness to our death, \n 'In which some great and memorable fame \n 'Thou, Fortune, dost prepare. What glorious deeds \n ' Of warlike heroism, of noble faith, \n 'Time's annals show! All these shall we surpass. \n 'True, Caesar, that to fall upon our swords \n 'For thee is little; yet beleaguered thus, \n 'With neither sons nor parents at our sides, \n 'Shorn of the glory that we might have earned, \n 'We give thee here the only pledge we may. \n 'Yet let these hostile thousands fear the souls \n 'That rage for battle and that welcome death, \n 'And know us for invincible, and joy \n 'That no more rafts were stayed. They'll offer terms, \n 'And tempt us with a base unhonoured life. \n 'Would that, to give that death which shall be ours \n 'The greater glory, they may bid us hope \n 'For pardon and for life! lest when our swords \n 'Are reeking with our hearts'-blood, they may say \n 'This was despair of living. Great must be \n 'The prowess of our end, if in the hosts \n 'That fight his battles, Caesar is to mourn \n 'This little handful lost. For me, should fate \n 'Grant us retreat-myself would scorn to shun \n 'The coming onset. Life I cast away, \n 'The frenzy of the death that comes apace \n 'Controls my being. Those whose end is near \n 'Alone may know the happiness of death; \n 'Which pitying heaven from all else conceals \n 'That men may bear to live.' His stirring words \n Warmed his brave comrades' hearts-they who with fear \n And tearful eyes had looked upon the Wain, \n Turning his nightly course, now hoped for day, \n Such precepts deep within them. Nor delayed \n The sky to dip the stars below the main; \n For Phoebus in the Twins his chariot drave \n At noon near Cancer; and the hours of night \n \n Were shortened by the Archer. \n When day broke, \n Lo! on the rocks the Istrians; while the sea \n Swarmed with the galleys and their Grecian fleet \n All armed for fight: but first the war was stayed \n And terms proposed: life to the foe they thought \n Would seem the sweeter, by delay of death \n Thus granted. But the band devoted stood, \n Proud of their promised end, life all forsworn, \n And careless of the fight: no jarring note \n Opposed their high resolve. In numbers few \n 'Gainst foemen numberless by land and sea, \n They wage the desperate war; then satiate \n Turn from the foe. And first demanding death \n Volteius bared his throat. ' What youth,' he cries, \n ' Dares strike me down, and through his captain's wounds \n 'Attest his love for death? ' Then through his side \n Plunge blades uncounted on the moment drawn. \n He praises all : but him who struck the first \n Grateful, with dying strength, he does to death. \n They rush together, and without a foe \n Work all the guilt of battle. Thus of yore, \n Rose up the glittering Dircaean band \n From seed by Cadmus sown, and fought and died, \n Dire omen for the brother kings of Thebes . \n And so in Phasis ' fields the sons of earth, \n Born of the sleepless dragon, all inflamed \n By magic incantations, with their blood \n Deluged the monstrous furrow, while the Queen \n Feared at the spells she wrought. Devoted thus \n To death, they fall, yet in their death itself \n Less valour show than in the fatal wounds \n They take and give; for e'en the dying hand \n Missed not a blow nor did the stroke alone \n Inflict the wound, but rushing on the sword \n Their throat or breast received it to the hilt; \n And when by fatal chance or sire with son, \n Or brothers met, yet with unfaltering weight \n Down flashed the pitiless sword: this proved their love, \n To give no second blow. Half living now \n They dragged their mangled bodies to the side, \n Whence flowed into the sea a crimson stream \n Of slaughter. 'Twas their pleasure yet to see \n The light they scorned; with haughty looks to scan \n The faces of their victors, and to feel \n The death approaching. But the raft was now \n Piled up with dead; which, when the foemen saw, \n Wondering at such a chief and such a deed, \n They gave them burial. Never through the world \n Of any brave achievement was the fame \n More widely blazed. Yet meaner men, untaught \n By such examples, see not that the hand \n Which frees from slavery needs no valiant mind \n To guide the stroke. But tyranny is feared \n As dealing death; and Freedom's self is galled \n By ruthless arms; and knows not that the sword \n Was given for this, that none need live a slave. \n Ah Death! wouldst thou but let the coward live \n And grant the brave alone the prize to die! \n Nor less were Libyan fields ablaze with war.\n \n \n For Curio rash from Lilybaean coast \n Sailed with his fleet, and borne by gentle winds \n Betwixt half-ruined Carthage , mighty once, \n And Clupea's cliff, upon the well-known shore \n His anchors dropped. First from the hoary sea \n Remote, where Bagra slowly ploughs the sand, \n He placed his camp: then sought the further hills \n And mazy passages of cavernous rocks, \n Antaeus' kingdom called. From ancient days \n This name was given; and thus a swain retold \n The story handed down from sire to son: \n 'Not yet exhausted by the giant brood, \n 'Earth still another monster brought to birth, \n 'In Libya 's caverns: huger far was he, \n 'More justly far her pride, than Briareus \n With all his hundred hands, or Typhon fierce, \n Or Tityos: 'twas in mercy to the gods \n 'That not in Phlegra's fields Antaeus grew, \n 'But here in Libya; to her offspring's strength, \n 'Unmeasured, vast, she added yet this boon, \n 'That when in weariness and labour spent \n 'He touched his parent, fresh from her embrace \n 'Renewed in vigour he should rise again. \n 'In yonder cave he dwelt, 'neath yonder rock \n 'He made his feast on lions slain in chase: \n 'There slept he; not on skins of beasts, or leaves, \n 'But fed his strength upon the naked earth. \n Perished the Libyan hinds and those who came, \n 'Brought here in ships, until he scorned at length \n 'The earth that gave him strength, and on his feet \n 'Invincible and with unaided might \n 'Made all his victims. Last to Afric shores, \n ' Drawn by the rumour of such carnage, came \n ' Magnanimous Alcides, he who freed \n 'Both land and sea of monsters. Down on earth \n 'He threw his mantle of the lion's skin \n ' Slain in Cleone; nor Antaeus less \n 'Cast down the hide he wore. With shining oil, \n 'As one who wrestles at Olympia 's feast, \n 'The hero rubbed his limbs: the giant feared \n ' Lest standing only on his parent earth \n 'His strength might fail; and cast o'er all his bulk \n ' Hot sand in handfuls. Thus with arms entwined \n 'And grappling hands each seizes on his foe; \n 'With hardened muscles straining at the neck \n 'Long time in vain; for firm the sinewy throat \n ' Stood column-like, nor yielded; so that each \n ' Wondered to find his peer. Nor at the first \n 'Divine Alcides put forth all his strength, \n ' By lengthy struggle wearing out his foe, \n 'Till chilly drops stood on Antaeus' limbs, \n 'And toppled to its fall the stately throat, \n 'And smitten by the hero's blows, the legs \n ' Began to totter. Breast to breast they strive \n 'To gain the vantage, till the victor's arms \n 'Gird in the giant's yielding back and sides, \n 'And squeeze his middle part: next 'twixt the thighs \n ' He puts his feet, and forcing them apart, \n 'Lays low the mighty monster limb by limb. \n 'The dry earth drank his sweat, while in his veins \n 'Warm ran the life-blood, and with strength refreshed, \n 'The muscles swelled and all the joints grew firm, \n 'And with his might restored, he breaks his bonds \n 'And rives the arms of Hercules away. \n 'Amazed the hero stood at such a strength. \n 'Not thus he feared, though then unused to war, \n 'That hydra fierce which, smitten in the marsh \n 'Of Inachus, renewed its severed heads. \n 'They fought as peers, the giant with the powers \n 'Which earth bestowed, the hero with his own: \n ' Nor did the hatred of his step-dame find \n 'In all his conflicts greater room for hope. \n ' She sees bedewed in sweat the neck and limbs \n 'Which once had borne the burden of the heavens \n ' Nor knew the toil: and when Antaeus felt \n ' His foeman's arms close round him once again, \n ' He flung his wearying limbs upon the sand \n ' To rise with strength renewed; all that the earth, \n 'Though labouring sore, could breathe into her son \n 'She gave his frame. But Hercules at last \n ' Saw how his parent gave the giant strength. \n '\" Stand thou,\" he cried; \"no more upon the ground \n ' \"Thou liest at thy will-here must thou stay \n '\" Within mine arms constrained; against this breast, \n '\" Antaeus, shalt thou fall.\" He lifted up \n ' And held by middle girth the giant form, \n 'Still struggling for the soil: but she no more \n 'Could give her offspring vigour. Slowly came \n 'The chill of death upon him, and 'twas long \n 'Before the hero, of his victory sure, \n 'Trusted the earth and laid the giant down. \n 'Hence, hoar antiquity that loves to prate \n 'And wonders at herself, this region called \n 'Antaeus' kingdom. But a greater name \n ' Yon hills from Scipio gained, when he recalled \n 'From Roman citadels the Punic chief. \n 'Here was his camp; here canst thou see the trace \n ' Of that most famous rampart whence at length \n 'Issued the Eagles of triumphant Rome .' \n But Curio rejoiced, as though for him \n The fortunes of the spot must hold in store \n The fates of former chiefs: and on the place \n Of happy augury placed his tents ill-starred; \n Took from the hills their omens; and with force \n Unequal, challenged his barbarian foe. \n All Africa that bore the Roman yoke \n Then lay 'neath Varus. He, though placing first \n Trust in his Latian troops, from every side \n And furthest regions, summons to his aid \n The nations who confessed King Juba's rule. \n Not any monarch over wider tracts \n Held the dominion. From the western belt \n \n Near Gades , Atlas parts their furthest bounds; \n But from the southern, Hammon girds them in \n Hard by the whirlpools; and their burning plains \n Stretch forth unending 'neath the torrid zone, \n In breadth its equal, till they reach at length \n The shore of ocean upon either hand. \n From all these regions tribes unnumbered flock \n To Juba's standard: Moors of swarthy hue \n As though from Ind; Numidian nomads there \n And Nasamon's needy hordes; and those whose darts \n Rival the flying arrows of the Mede : \n Dark Garamantians leave their fervid home; \n And those whose coursers unrestrained by bit \n Or saddle, yet obey the rider's hand \n Which wields the guiding switch: the hunter, too, \n Who wanders forth, his home a fragile hut, \n And blinds with flowing robe (if spear should fail) \n The angry lion, monarch of the steppe. \n Not eagerness alone to save the state \n Stirred Juba's spirit: private hatred too \n Roused him to war. For in the former year, \n When Curio all things human and the gods \n \n Polluted, he by tribune law essayed \n To ravish Libya from the tyrant's sway, \n And drive the monarch from his father's throne, \n While giving Rome a king. To Juba thus, \n Still smarting at the insult, came the war, \n A welcome harvest for his crown retained. \n These rumours Curio feared: nor had his troops \n (Ta'en in Corfinium 's hold) in waves of Rhine \n \n Been tested, nor to Caesar in the wars \n Had learned devotion: wavering in their faith, \n Their second chief they doubt, their first betrayed. \n Yet when the general saw the spirit of fear \n Creep through his camp, and discipline to fail, \n And sentinels desert their guard at night, \n Thus in his fear he spake : ' By daring much \n ' Fear is disguised; let me be first in arms, \n 'And bid my soldiers to the plain descend, \n While still my soldiers. Idle days breed doubt. \n ' By fight forestall the plot. Soon as the thirst \n 'Of bloodshed fills the mind, and eager hands \n ' Grip firm the sword, and pressed upon the brow \n ' The helm brings valour to the failing heart- \n ' Who cares to measure leaders' merits then? \n ' Who weighs the cause? With whom the soldier stands, \n 'For him he fights; as at the fatal show \n No ancient grudge the gladiator's arm \n ' Nerves for the combat, yet as he shall strike \n ' He hates his rival.' Thinking thus he led \n His troops in battle order to the plain. \n Then victory on his arms deceptive shone \n Hiding the ills to come: for from the field \n Driving the hostile host with sword and spear, \n He smote them till their camp opposed his way.\n \n \n But after Varus' rout, unseen till then, \n All eager for the glory to be his, \n By stealth came Juba: silent was his march; \n His only fear lest rumour should forestall \n His coming victory. In pretended war \n He sends Sabura forth with scanty force \n To tempt the enemy, while in hollow vale \n He holds the armies of his realm unseen. \n 'Tis thus the sly ichneumon with his tail \n Waving, allures the serpent of the Nile \n \n Drawn to the moving shadow: he, with head \n Turned sideways, watches till the victim glides \n Within his reach, then seizes by the throat \n Behind the deadly fangs: forth from its seat \n Balked of its purpose, through the brimming jaws \n Gushes a tide of poison. Fortune smiled \n On Juba's stratagem; for Curio \n (The hidden forces of the foe unknown) \n Sent forth his horse by night without the camp \n To scour more distant regions. He himself \n At earliest peep of dawn bids carry forth \n His standards; heeding not his captains' prayer \n Urged on his ears: ' Beware of Punic fraud, \n ' The craft that taints a Carthaginian war.' \n Hung over him the doom of coming death \n And gave the youth to fate; and civil strife \n Dragged down its author. \n On the lofty tops \n Where broke the hills abruptly to their fall \n He ranks his troops and sees the foe afar: \n Who still deceiving, simulated flight, \n Till from the height in loose unordered lines \n The Roman forces streamed upon the plain, \n In thought that Juba fled. Then first was known \n The treacherous fraud: for swift Numidian horse \n On every side surround them: leader, men- \n All see their fate in one dread moment come. \n No coward flees, no warrior bravely strides \n To meet the battle: nay, the trumpet call \n Stirs not the charger with resounding hoof \n To spurn the rock, nor galling bit compels \n To champ in eagerness; nor toss his mane \n And prick the ear, nor prancing with his feet \n To claim his share of combat. Tired, the neck \n Droops downwards: smoking sweat bedews the limbs: \n Dry from the squalid mouth protrudes the tongue, \n Hoarse, raucous panting issues from their chests; \n Their flanks distended: and on every curb \n Dry foam of blood; the ruthless sword alone \n Could move them onward, powerless even then \n To charge; but giving to the hostile dart \n A nearer victim. But when the Afric horse \n First made their onset, loud beneath their hoofs \n Rang the wide plain, and rose the dust in air \n As by some Thracian whirlwind stirred; and veiled \n The heavens in darkness. When on Curio's host \n The tempest burst, each footman in the rank \n Stood there to meet his fate-no doubtful end \n Hung in the balance: destiny proclaimed \n Death to them all. No conflict hand to hand \n Was granted them, by lances thrown from far \n And sidelong sword-thrusts slain: nor wounds alone, \n But clouds of weapons falling from the air \n By weight of iron o'erwhelmed them. Still drew in \n The straightening circle, for the first pressed back \n On those behind; did any shun the foe, \n Seeking the inner safety of the ring, \n He needs must perish by his comrades' swords. \n And as the front rank fell, still narrower grew \n The close crushed phalanx, till to raise their swords \n Space was denied. Still close and closer forced \n The armed breasts against each other driven \n Pressed out the life. Thus not upon a scene \n Such as their fortune promised, gazed the foe. \n No tide of blood was there to glut their eyes, \n No members lopped asunder, though the earth \n Was piled with corpses; for each Roman stood \n In death upright against his comrade dead. \n Let cruel Carthage rouse her hated ghosts \n By this fell offering; let the Punic shades, \n And bloody Hannibal, from this defeat \n Receive atonement: yet 'twas shame, ye gods, \n That Libya gained not for herself the day; \n And that our Romans on that field should die \n To save Pompeius and the Senate's cause. \n Now was the dust laid low by streams of blood, \n And Curio, knowing that his host was slain, \n Chose not to live; and, as a brave man should, \n He rushed upon the heap, and fighting fell. \n In vain with turbid speech hast thou profaned \n The pulpit of the forum; waved in vain \n From that proud citadel the tribune flag: \n And armed the people, and the Senate's rights \n Betraying, hast compelled this impious war \n Betwixt the rival kinsmen. Low thou liest \n Before Pharsalus ' fight, and from thine eyes \n Is hid the war. 'Tis thus to suffering Rome , \n For arms seditious and for civil strife \n Ye mighty make atonement with your blood. \n Happy were Rome and all her sons indeed, \n Did but the gods as rigidly protect \n As they avenge, her violated laws! \n There Curio lies; untombed his noble corpse, \n Torn by the vultures of the Libyan wastes. \n Yet shall we, since such merit, though unsung, \n Lives by its own imperishable fame, \n Give thee thy meed of praise. Rome never bore \n Another son, who, had he right pursued, \n Had so adorned her laws; but soon the times, \n Their luxury, corruption, and the curse \n Of copious wealth swept o'er his wavering mind \n In stream transverse; and, bribed by spoils of Gaul \n \n And golden gifts of Caesar, Curio changed \n Turned with his change the scale of human things. \n True, mighty Sulla, cruel Marius, \n And bloody Cinna, and the long descent \n Of Caesar and of Caesar's house became \n Lords of our lives. But who had power like him? \n All others bought the state: he sold alone. \n \n "

            "0":"\n THUS had the smiles of Fortune and her frowns \n Brought either chief to Macedonian shores \n Still equal to his foe. From cooler skies \n Sank Atlas' daughters down, and Haemus ' slopes \n Were white with winter, and the day drew nigh \n Devoted to the god who leads the months, \n And marking with new names the book of Rome , \n When came the Fathers from their distant posts \n By both the Consuls to Epirus called \n \n Ere yet their year was dead: a foreign land \n Obscure received the magistrates of Rome ; \n A senate sojourning in foreign lands \n Held there high questions, not in warlike camp \n But hedged by all the axes of the law; \n And all men gazing on the reverend ranks \n Knew that no Magnus' party there was met, \n But all the state; and Magnus was but one. \n Mid silent sadness from his lofty seat \n Thus spake the Consul: ' If your hearts still beat \n ' With Latian blood, and if within your breasts \n ' Still lives your fathers' vigour, look not now \n ' On this strange land that holds us, nor enquire \n 'How far the captured city. Know the face \n Of your own company; the rulers you \n In all that comes. Be this your first decree, \n ' Whose truth all peoples and all kings confess; \n ' Be this the Senate. Let the frozen wain \n ' Demand your presence, or the torrid zone \n ' Wherein the day and night with equal tread \n 'For ever march; still follows in your steps \n ' The central power of Imperial Rome. \n ' When flamed the Capitol with fires of Gaul , \n ' When Veii held Camillus, there with him \n ' Was Rome , nor ever though it changed its clime \n ' Your order lost its rights. In Caesar's hands \n ' Are sorrowing houses and deserted homes, \n ' Laws silent for a space, and forums closed \n ' In public fast. His Senate-house beholds \n ' Those Fathers only whom from Rome it drove, \n ' While Rome was full. Of that high order all \n ' Not here, are exiles. Ignorant of war, \n 'Its crimes and bloodshed, through long years of peace, \n 'Ye fled its outburst: now in session all \n 'Are here assembled. See ye how the gods \n Weigh down Italia 's loss by all the world \n 'Thrown in the other scale? Illyria 's wave \n 'Rolls on our foes: in Libya 's arid wastes \n 'Is fallen their Curio, the weightier part \n \n 'Of Caesar's senate! Lift your standards, then, \n 'Spur on your fates and prove your hopes to heaven. \n 'Let Fortune, smiling, give you courage now \n 'As, when ye fled, your cause. The Consuls' power \n ' Fails with the dying year: not so does yours; \n ' By your commandment for the common weal \n ' Decree Pompeius leader.' With applause \n They heard his words, and placed their country's fates, \n Nor less their own, within the chieftain's hands. \n Then did they shower on people and on kings \n Honours well earned- Rhodes , Mistress of the Seas, \n Was decked with gifts; Athena, old in fame, \n Received her praise, and the rude tribes who dwell \n On cold Taygetus; Massilia 's sons \n Their own Phocaea 's freedom; on the chiefs \n Of Thracian tribes, fit honours were bestowed. \n They order Libya by their high decree \n To serve King Juba's sceptre; and, alas! \n On Ptolemaeus, of a faithless race \n The faithless sovereign, scandal to the gods, \n And shame to Fortune, placed the diadem \n Of Pella . Boy! against the common herd \n Fierce is thy weapon. Ah, if that were all! \n The fatal gift gave, too, Pompeius' life; \n Bereft thy sister of her sire's bequest, \n \n Half of the kingdom: Caesar of a crime. \n Then all to arms. While soldier thus and chief, \n In doubtful sort, against their hidden fate \n Devised their counsel, Appius only feared \n To face the chances of the war, and sought \n Through Phoebus' ancient oracle to break \n The silence of the gods, and know the end.\n \n \n Between the western belt and that which bounds \n \n The furthest east, midway Parnassus rears \n His double summit: to the Bromian god \n And Paean consecrate, to whom conjoined \n The Theban band leads up the Delphic feast \n On each third year. This mountain, when the sea \n Poured o'er the earth her billows, rose alone, \n By loftiest peak scarce master of the waves, \n Parting the crest of waters from the stars. \n There, to avenge his mother, from her home \n Chased by the angered goddess while as yet \n She bore him quick within her, Paean came \n (When Themis ruled the tripods and the spot) \n \n And with unpractised darts the Python slew. \n But when he saw how from the yawning cave \n A godlike knowledge breathed, and all the air \n Was full of voices murmured from the depths, \n He took the shrine and filled the deep recess; \n Henceforth a prophet. Which of all the gods \n Has left heaven's light in this dark cave to hide? \n What spirit that knows the secrets of the world \n And things to come, here condescends to dwell, \n Divine, omnipotent? bear the touch of man, \n And at his bidding deigns to lift the veil? \n Perchance he sings the fates; perchance his song, \n Once sung, is fate. Haply some part of Jove \n Sent here to rule the earth with mystic power, \n Balanced upon the void immense of air, \n Sounds through the caves, and in its flight returns \n To that high home of thunder whence it came. \n Caught in a virgin's breast, this deity \n Strikes on the human spirit: then a voice \n Sounds from her breast, as when the lofty peak \n Of Etna boils, forced by compelling flames, \n Or as Typheus on Campania 's shore \n Frets 'neath the pile of huge Inarime . \n \n Though free to all that ask, denied to none, \n No human passion lurks within the voice \n That heralds forth the god; no whispered vow, \n No evil prayer prevails; none favour gain: \n Of things unchangeable the song divine; \n Yet loves the just. When men have left their homes \n To seek another, it has turned their steps \n Aright, as with the Tyrians; and raised \n The hearts of men to war, as prove the waves \n Of Salamis : when earth refused her fruits \n Or plague has filled the air, this voice benign \n Has given fresh hope and pointed to the end. \n No gift from heaven's high gods so great as this \n Our centuries have lost, since Delphi 's shrine \n Has silent stood, and kings forbade the gods \n \n To speak the future, fearing for their fates. \n Nor does the priestess sorrow that the voice \n Is heard no longer; and the silent fane \n To her is happiness; for whatever breast \n Contains the deity, its shattered frame \n Surges with frenzy, and the soul divine \n Shakes the frail breath that with the god receives, \n As prize or punishment, untimely death. \n These tripods Appius seeks, unmoved for years, \n These soundless caverned rocks, in quest to learn \n Hesperia's destinies. At his command \n To loose the sacred gateways and permit \n The prophetess to enter to the god, \n The keeper calls Phemonoe; whose steps \n Round the Castalian fount and in the grove \n Were wandering careless; her he bids to pass \n The portals. But the priestess feared to tread \n The awful threshold, and with vain deceits \n Sought to dissuade the chieftain from his zeal \n To learn the future. ' What this hope,' she cried, \n Roman, that moves thy breast to know the fates? \n 'Long has Parnassus and its silent cleft \n 'Stifled the god; perhaps the breath divine \n 'Has left its ancient gorge and through the world \n 'Wanders in devious paths; or else the fane, \n 'Consumed to ashes by barbarian fire, \n 'Closed up the deep recess and choked the path \n 'Of Phoebus; or the ancient Sibyl's books \n 'Disclosed enough of fate, and thus the gods \n 'Decreed to close the oracle; or else \n 'Since wicked steps are banished from the fane, \n 'In this our impious age the god finds none \n 'Whom he may answer.' But the maiden's guile \n Was known, for though she would deny the gods \n Her fears approved them. On her front she binds \n A twisted fillet, while a shining wreath \n Of Phocian laurels crowns the locks that flow \n Upon her shoulders. Hesitating yet, \n The priest compelled her, and she passed within. \n But horror filled her of the holiest depths \n From which the mystic oracle proceeds; \n And resting near the doors, in breast unmoved \n She dares invent the god in words confused, \n Which proved no mind possessed with fire divine; \n By such false chant less injuring the chief \n Than faith in Phoebus and the sacred fane. \n No burst of words with tremor in their tones, \n No voice re-echoing through the spacious vault \n Proclaimed the deity, no bristling locks \n Shook off the laurel chaplet; but the grove \n Unshaken, and the summits of the shrine, \n Gave proof she shunned the god. The Roman knew \n The tripods yet were idle, and in rage, \n 'Wretch,' he exclaimed, 'to us and to the gods, \n 'Whose presence thou pretendest, thou shalt pay \n 'The punishment; unless thou enter the recess, \n 'And cease to speak in phrases of thine own \n Of this vast conflict, of a world by war \n 'Convulsed and shaken.' Then by fear compelled, \n At length the priestess sought the furthest depths, \n And stayed beside the tripods; and there came \n Into her unaccustomed breast the god, \n Breathed from the living rock for centuries \n Untouched; nor ever with a mightier power \n Did Paean's inspiration seize the frame \n Of Delphic priestess; his pervading touch \n Expelled the mortal, and her former mind, \n And made her wholly his. In maddened trance \n She whirled throughout the cave, her locks erect \n With horror, and the fillets of the god \n Dashed to the ground; her steps unguided turned \n To this side and to that; the tripods fell \n O'erturned; within her seethed the mighty fire \n Of angry Phoebus; nor with whip alone \n He urged her onwards, but with curb restrained; \n Nor was it given her by the god to speak \n All that she knew; for into one vast mass \n \n All time was gathered, and her panting chest \n Groaned 'neath the centuries. In order long \n All things lay bare: the future yet unveiled \n Struggled for light; each fate required a voice; \n The compass of the seas, Creation's birth, \n Creation's death, the number of the sands, \n All these she knew. Thus on a former day \n The prophetess upon the Cuman shore, \n \n Disdaining that her frenzy should be slave \n To other nations, from the boundless threads \n Chose out with pride of hand the fates of Rome . \n E'en so Phemonoe, for a time oppressed \n With fates unnumbered, laboured ere she found, \n Beneath such mighty destinies concealed, \n Thine, Appius, who alone hadst sought the god \n In land Castalian; then from foaming lips \n First rushed the madness forth, and murmurs loud \n Uttered with panting breath and blent with groans; \n Till through the spacious vault a voice at length \n Broke from the virgin conquered by the god: \n 'From this great struggle thou, O Roman, free \n 'Escap'st the threats of war : alive, in peace, \n 'Thou shalt possess the hollow in the coast \n 'Of vast Euboea .' Thus she spake, no more. \n Ye mystic tripods, guardians of the fates \n And Paean, thou, from whom no day is hid \n By heaven's high rulers, Master of the truth, \n Why fear'st thou to reveal the deaths of kings, \n \n Rome 's murdered princes, and the latest doom \n Of her great Empire tottering to its fall, \n And all the bloodshed of that western land? \n Were yet the stars in doubt on Magnus' fate \n Not yet decreed, and did the gods yet shrink \n From that, the greatest crime? Or wert thou dumb \n That Fortune's sword for civil strife might wreak \n Just vengeance, and a Brutus' arm once more \n Strike down the tyrant? \n From the temple doors \n Rushed forth the prophetess in frenzy driven, \n Not all her knowledge uttered; and her eyes, \n Still troubled by the god who reigned within, \n Or filled with wild affright, or fired with rage \n Gaze on the wide expanse: still works her face \n Convulsive; on her cheeks a crimson blush \n With ghastly pallor blent, though not of fear. \n Her weary heart throbs ever; and as seas \n Boom swollen by northern winds, she finds in sighs, \n All inarticulate, relief. But while \n She hastes from that dread light in which she saw \n The fates, to common day, lo! on her path \n The darkness fell. Then by a Stygian draught \n Of the forgetful river, Phoebus snatched \n Back from her soul his secrets; and she fell \n Yet hardly living. Nor did Appius dread \n Approaching death, but by dark oracles \n Baffled, while yet the Empire of the world \n Hung in the balance, sought his promised realm \n In Chalcis of Euboea . Yet to escape \n All ills of earth, the crash of war-what god \n Can give thee such a boon, but death alone? \n For on the solitary shore a grave \n Awaits thee, where Carystos' marble crags \n \n Draw in the passage of the sea, and where \n The fane of Rhamnus rises to the gods \n \n Who hate the proud, and where the ocean strait \n Boils in swift whirlpools, and Euripus draws \n Deceitful in his tides, a bane to ships, \n Chalcidian vessels to bleak Aulis ' shore.\n \n \n But Caesar carried from the conquered west \n His eagles to another world of war; \n When envying his victorious course the gods \n Almost turned back the prosperous tide of fate. \n Not on the battle-field borne down by arms, \n But in his tents, within the rampart lines, \n The hoped-for prize of this unholy war \n Seemed for a moment gone. That faithful host, \n His comrades trusted in a hundred fields, \n Almost forsook him. The sad trump perchance \n Mute for a moment, and the blade in sheath \n Grown cold, had tamed their frenzy for the war; \n Or else in hope of greater gifts, their cause \n And leader they betrayed, and sold the sword \n Still soiled with murder. By no other risk \n Caesar more surely learned how as he looked \n O'er all things else, the height on which he stood \n Trembled beneath him. But a moment since \n His high behest drew nations to the war; \n Now, maimed of all who smote, no weapon left \n Saving his own, he knows that swords unsheathed \n Are wielded by the soldier, not the chief. \n No timorous voice was there; no silent wrath \n Concealed; nor doubting mind, as though alone \n Indignant at the wrong, and in distrust \n Of those in turn distrusting. Fear in each \n Had fled before the boldness of the host: \n The crime is free where thousands bear the guilt. \n They hurled their menace: 'Caesar, give us leave \n 'To quit thy crimes; thou seek'st by land and sea \n 'The sword to slay us; let the fields of Gaul \n \n And far Iberia , and the world proclaim \n 'How for thy victories our comrades fell. \n 'What boots it us that by an army's blood \n 'The Rhine and Rhone and all the northern lands \n 'Thou hast subdued? Thou giv'st us civil war \n 'For all these battles; such the prize. When fled \n 'The Senate trembling, and when Rome was ours \n 'What homes or temples did we spoil? Our hands \n 'Reek with offence! Aye, but our poverty \n 'Proclaims our innocence! What end shall be \n Of arms and armies? What shall be enough \n 'If Rome suffice not? and what lies beyond? \n 'Behold these silvered locks, these nerveless hands \n 'And shrunken arms, once stalwart! In thy wars \n 'Gone is the strength of life, gone all its pride! \n 'Dismiss thine aged soldiers to their deaths. \n 'How shameless is our prayer! Not on hard turf \n 'To stretch our dying limbs; nor seek in vain, \n ' When parts the soul, a hand to close our eyes; \n 'Not with the helm to strike the stony ground: \n \n ' Rather to feel the dear one's last embrace, \n ' And gain a humble but a separate tomb. \n 'Let sickness end old age. If Caesar's slaves, \n ' Let something more than battle be our doom. \n ' Deem'st thou we are thy dupes? that we alone \n ' In civil war are ignorant what crime \n ' Will fetch the highest price? What thou canst dare \n ' These years have proved, or nothing; law divine \n ' Nor human ordinance shall hold thine hand. \n 'He was our leader on the banks of Rhine ; \n ' Now is our equal; for the stain of crime \n ' Makes all men like. And for a judge ingrate \n ' We waste our valour; for as fortune's gift \n ' He takes the victory which our arms have won: \n 'But we his fortunes are, his fates are ours \n 'To fashion as we will. Boast that the gods \n ' Shall do thy bidding! Nay, thy soldiers' will \n ' Shall close the war.' With threatening mien and speech \n Thus through the camp the troops demand their chief. \n When faith and loyalty are fled, and hope \n For aught but evil, thus may civil war \n In mutiny and discord find its end! \n What general had not feared at such revolt? \n But mighty Caesar trusting on the throw, \n \n As was his wont, his fortune, and o'erjoyed \n To front their anger raging at its height \n Unflinching comes. No temples of the gods, \n Not Jove's high fane on the Tarpeian rock, \n Not Rome 's high dames nor maidens had he grudged \n To their most savage lust: that they should ask \n The worst, his wish, and love the spoils of war. \n Nor feared he aught save order at the hands \n Of that unconquered host. Art thou not shamed \n That strife should please thee only, now condemned \n Even by thy minions? Shall they shrink from blood, \n They from the sword recoil? and thou rush on \n Heedless of guilt, through right and through unright, \n Nor learn that men may lay their arms aside \n Yet bear to live? This civil butchery \n Escapes thy grasp. Stay thou thy crimes at length; \n Nor force thy will on those who will no more. \n Upon a turfy mound unmoved he stood \n And, since he feared not, worthy to be feared; \n And thus while anger stirred his soul began : \n ' Thou that with voice and hand didst rage but now \n ' Against thine absent chief, behold me here; \n Plunge in this breast, all ready for the wound \n And bare, thy sword; and end the war and flee. \n This mutiny devoid of daring deed \n Betrays your coward souls, betrays the youth \n ' Who tires of victories which gild the arms \n Of an unconquered chief, and yearns for flight. \n Leave me to fate; with that I'll wage the war \n You I cast forth. For every weapon left, \n Fortune shall find a man, to wield it well. \n Shall Magnus in his flight with such a fleet \n Draw nations in his train; and not to me \n ' My victories bring legions? They shall reap \n ' For its mere close the prizes of the war \n ' Won by your toil, and scatheless join the train \n 'That leads my chariot to the sacred hill: \n ' While you, despised in age and battle worn, \n ' Gaze on our triumph from the civic crowd. \n ' Think you your dastard flight shall give me pause? \n ' If all the rivers that now seek the sea \n ' Were to withdraw their waters, it would fail \n ' By not one inch, no more than by their flow \n 'It rises now. Have then your efforts given \n ' Strength to my cause? Not so: the heavenly gods \n ' Stoop not so low; fate has no time to judge \n ' Your lives and deaths. The fortunes of the world \n ' Follow heroic souls: for the fit few \n 'The many live; and you who terrified \n ' With me the northern and Iberian worlds, \n ' Would flee when led by Magnus. Strong with me \n ' Was Labienus: vile deserter now; \n ' A homeless exile with his chief preferred. \n ' Nor were your faith more firm if, neither side \n 'Espoused, you ceased from arms. Who leaves me once, \n 'Though not to fight against me with the foe, \n 'Joins not my ranks again. Surely the gods \n 'Smile on these arms who for so great a war \n 'Grant me fresh soldiers. From what heavy load \n 'Fortune relieves me! for the hands which aimed \n 'At all, to which the world did not suffice, \n 'I now disarm, and for myself alone \n 'Reserve the conflict. Quit ye, then, my camp, \n 'And leave my standards to the grasp of men, \n 'Coward Quirites! But some guilty few \n 'I keep, not as their captain, but their judge. \n 'Lie, traitors, prone on earth, stretch out the neck \n 'And take th' avenging blow. And thou whose strength \n 'Shall now support me, young and yet untaught, \n 'Behold the doom and learn to strike and die.' \n Such were his words of ire, and all the host \n Drew back and trembled at the voice of him \n They would depose, as though their very swords \n Would from their scabbards leap at his command \n Themselves unwilling; but he only feared \n Lest hand and blade to satisfy the doom \n Might be denied; till they submitting pledged \n Their lives and swords alike, beyond his hope. \n To strike and suffer holds in surest thrall \n The heart inured to guilt; and Caesar kept, \n By dreadful compact ratified in blood, \n Those whom he feared to lose.\n \n \n He bids them reach \n In ten days' march Brundusium , and recall \n From old Tarentum and from Hydrus lone \n His navy, and from Leucas ' point remote, \n And the Salapian marsh where Sipus lies \n By rich Garganus, jutting from the shore \n In huge escarpment that divides the waves \n Of Hadria ; on each hand, his seaward slopes \n Buffeted by the winds; or Auster borne \n From sweet Apulia , or the sterner blast \n Of Boreas rushing from Dalmatian strands. \n But Caesar entered safe without a guard \n \n Rome , trembling, taught to serve the garb of peace, \n Dictator named, to grant their prayers, forsooth: \n Consul, in honour of the roll of Rome . \n Then first of all the names by which we now \n Lie to our masters, men found out the use: \n For to preserve his right to wield the sword \n He mixed the civil axes with his brands; \n With eagles, fasces; with an empty word \n Clothing his power; and stamped upon the time \n A worthy designation; for what name \n Could better mark the dread Pharsalian year \n Than 'Caesar, Consul'? Now the famous field \n Pretends its ancient ceremonies: calls \n The tribes in order and divides the votes \n In vain solemnity of empty urns. \n Nor did they heed the portents of the sky: \n Deaf were the augurs to the thunder roll; \n The owl flew on the left; yet were the birds \n Propitious sworn. Then was the ancient name \n Degraded first; and monthly Consuls, now \n Shorn of their rank, were chosen to mark the years. \n And Trojan Alba's god (since Latium 's fall \n Deserving not) beheld the wonted fires \n Blaze from his altars on the festal night. \n Then through Apulia 's fallows, which her hinds \n Left all untilled, to sluggish weeds a prey \n Passed Caesar onward, swifter than the fire \n Of heaven, or tigress dam: until he reached \n \n Brundusium 's winding ramparts, built of old \n By Cretan colonists. There icy winds \n Constrained the billows, and his trembling fleet \n Feared for the winter storms nor dared the main. \n But Caesar's soul burned at the moments lost \n For speedy battle, nor could brook delay \n Within the port, indignant that the sea \n Should give safe passage to his routed foe: \n And thus he stirred his troops, in seas unskilled, \n With words of courage: 'When the winter wind \n 'Has seized on sky and ocean, firm its hold; \n But the inconstancy of cloudy spring \n 'Permits no certain breezes to prevail \n 'Upon the billows. Straight shall be our course. \n 'No winding nooks of coast, but open seas \n Struck by the northern wind alone we plough, \n 'And may he bend the spars, and bear us swift \n 'To Grecian cities; else Pompeius' ships \n 'From coasts Phaeacian, with their swifter oars \n May catch our flagging sails. Cast loose the ropes \n 'From our victorious prows. Too long we waste \n 'Tempests that blow to bear us to our goal.' \n Now sank the sun to rest; the evening star \n Shone on the darkening heaven, and the moon \n Reigned with her paler light, when all the fleet \n Freed from retaining cables seized the main. \n With slackened sheet the canvas wooed the breeze, \n Which rose and fell and fitful died away, \n Till motionless the sails, and all the waves \n Were still as deepest pool, where never wind \n Ripples the surface. Thus in Scythian climes \n Cimmerian Bosphorus restrains the deep \n Bound fast in frosty fetters; Ister's streams \n \n No more impel the main, and ships constrained \n Stand fast in ice; and while in depths below \n The waves still murmur, loud the charger's hoof \n Sounds on the surface, and the travelling wheel \n Furrows a track upon the frozen marsh. \n Cruel as tempest was the calm that lay \n In stagnant pools upon the mournful deep: \n Against the course of nature lay outstretched \n A rigid ocean: 'twas as if the sea \n Forgat its ancient ways and knew no more \n The ceaseless tides, nor any breeze of heaven, \n Nor quivered at the image of the sun, \n Mirrored upon its wave. For while the fleet \n Hung in mid passage motionless, the foe \n Might hurry to attack, with sturdy stroke \n Churning the deep; or famine's deadly grip \n Might seize the ships becalmed. For dangers new \n New vows they found: for tempests was their prayer, \n To rouse the billows till the watery plain \n Freed from its torpor should be sea once more. \n But cloudless was the sky and calm the deep, \n All hope of shipwreck gone, till night was fled, \n And marred by gathering mist the day arose \n And stirred the depths, and moved the fleet along \n Towards the Ceraunian headland; and the waves \n And favouring breezes followed on the ships, \n Now speeding faster, till (their goal attained) \n They cast their anchors on Palaeste's shore. \n This land first saw the chiefs in neighbouring camps \n Confronted, which the streams of Apsus bound \n And swifter Genusus; a lengthy course \n Is run by neither, but on Apsus' waves \n Scarce flowing from a marsh, the frequent boat \n Finds room to swim; while on the foamy bed \n Of Genusus by sun or shower compelled \n The melted snows pour seawards. Here were met \n (So Fortune ordered it) the mighty pair; \n And in its woes the world yet vainly hoped \n That, brought to nearer touch, their crime itself \n Might breed abhorrence: for from either camp \n Voices were clearly heard and features seen. \n Nor e'er, Pompeius, since that distant day \n When Caesar's daughter and thy spouse was reft \n By pitiless fate away, nor left a pledge, \n Did thy loved kinsman (save on sands of Nile ) \n So nearly look upon thy face again.\n \n \n But Caesar's mind though frenzied for the fight \n Was forced to pause until Antonius brought \n The rearward troops; Antonius even now \n Rehearsing Leucas ' fight. With prayers and threats \n Caesar exhorts him. ' Why delay the fates, \n Thou cause of evil to the suffering world? \n My speed hath won the major part: from thee \n Fortune demands the final stroke alone. \n Do Libyan whirlpools with deceitful tides \n Uncertain separate us? Is the deep \n Untried to which I call? To unknown risks \n Art thou commanded? Caesar bids thee come, \n Thou sluggard, not to leave him. Long ago \n I ran my ships midway through sands and shoals \n To harbours held by foes; and dost thou fear \n My friendly camp? I mourn the waste of days \n 'Which fate allotted us. Upon the waves \n And winds I call unceasing: hold not back \n Thy willing troops, but let them dare the sea; \n Here gladly shall they come to join my camp, \n Though risking shipwreck: with indignant voice \n I call upon thee. Not in equal shares \n 'The world has fallen between us: thou alone \n Dost hold Italia , but Epirus I \n And all the lords of Rome .' Twice called and thrice \n Antonius lingered still: but Caesar's mind \n Was that he failed the gods, not they his cause. \n By night he braved the strait which others feared \n Though bidden: for he knew that daring deeds \n Are safely wrought beneath the smile of heaven: \n And thus he hoped in fragile boat to cross \n The stormy billows fearful to a fleet. \n Now gentle night had brought repose from arms; \n And sleep, blest guardian of the poor man's couch, \n Restored the weary; and the camp was still. \n The hour was come that called the second watch \n When mighty Caesar, in the silence vast \n With cautious tread advanced to such a deed \n \n As slaves should dare not. Fortune for his guide, \n Alone he passes on, and o'er the guard \n Stretched in repose he leaps, in secret wrath \n At such a sleep. Pacing the winding beach, \n Fast to a sea-worn rock he finds a boat \n On ocean's marge afloat. Hard by on shore \n Its master dwelt within his humble home. \n No solid front it reared, for sterile rush \n And marshy reed enwoven formed the walls, \n Propped by a shallop with its bending sides \n Turned upwards. Caesar's hand upon the door \n Knocks twice and thrice until the fabric shakes. \n Amyclas from his couch of soft seaweed \n Arising, calls: ' What shipwrecked sailor seeks \n 'My humble home? Who hopes for aid from me, \n ' By fates adverse compelled? ' He stirs the heap \n Upon the hearth, until a tiny spark \n Glows in the darkness, and throws wide the door. \n Careless of war, he knew that civil strife \n Stoops not to cottages. O! happy life \n That poverty affords! great gift of heaven \n Too little understood! what mansion wall, \n What temple of the gods, would feel no fear \n When Caesar called for entrance? Then the chief: \n ' Enlarge thine hopes and look for better things. \n ' Do but my bidding, and on yonder shore \n ' Place me, and thou shalt cease from one poor boat \n ' To earn thy living; and in years to come \n ' Look for a rich old age: and trust thy fates \n ' To those high gods whose wont it is to bless \n ' The poor with sudden plenty.' So he spake \n E'en at such time in accents of command, \n For how could Caesar else? Amyclas said, \n ''Twere dangerous to brave the deep to-night. \n ' The sun descended not in ruddy clouds \n ' Or peaceful rays to rest; part of his beams \n ' Presaged a southern gale, the rest proclaimed \n ' A northern tempest; and his middle orb, \n ' Shorn of its strength, permitted human eyes \n ' To gaze upon his grandeur; and the moon \n ' Rose not with silver horns upon the night \n ' Nor pure in middle space; her slender points \n 'Not drawn aright, but blushing with the track \n ' Of raging tempests, till her lurid light \n 'Was sadly veiled within the clouds. Again \n ' The forest sounds; the surf upon the shore; \n ' The dolphin's mood, uncertain where to play; \n ' The sea-mew on the land; the heron used \n ' To wade among the shallows, borne aloft \n ' And soaring on his wings-all these alarm; \n ' The raven, too, who plunged his head in spray, \n ' As if to anticipate the coming rain, \n And trod the margin with unsteady gait. \n But if the cause demands, behold me thine. \n 'Either we reach the bidden shore, or else \n 'Storm and the deep forbid-we can no more.' \n Thus said he loosed the boat and raised the sail. \n No sooner done than stars were seen to fall \n In flaming furrows from the sky: nay, more; \n The pole star trembled in its place on high: \n Black horror marked the surging of the sea; \n The main was boiling in long tracts of foam, \n Uncertain of the wind, yet seized with storm. \n Then spake the captain of the trembling bark: \n See what remorseless ocean has in store! \n Whether from east or west the storm may come \n Is still uncertain, for as yet confused \n 'The billows tumble. Judged by clouds and sky \n 'A western tempest: by the murmuring deep \n 'A wild south-eastern gale shall sweep the sea. \n 'Nor bark nor man shall reach Hesperia's shore \n In this wild rage of waters. To return \n 'Back on our course forbidden by the gods, \n 'Is our one refuge, and with labouring boat \n 'To reach the shore ere yet the nearest land \n 'May be too distant.' \n But great Caesar's trust \n Was in himself, to make all dangers yield. \n And thus he answered: ' Scorn the threatening sea, \n Spread out thy canvas to the raging wind; \n If for thy pilot thou refusest heaven, \n 'Me in its stead receive. Alone in thee \n One cause of terror just-thou dost not know \n 'Thy comrade, ne'er deserted by the gods, \n 'Whom fortune blesses e'en without a prayer. \n 'Break through the middle storm and trust in me. \n 'The burden of this fight falls not on us \n But on the sky and ocean; and our bark \n Shall swim the billows safe in him it bears. \n Nor shall the wind rage long: the boat itself \n Shall calm the waters. Flee the nearest shore, \n Steer for the ocean with unswerving hand: \n Then in the deep, when to our ship and us \n No other port is given, believe thou hast \n ' Calabria 's harbours. And dost thou not know \n 'The purpose of such havoc? Fortune seeks \n 'In all this tumult of the sea and sky \n A boon for Caesar.'\n \n \n Then a hurricane \n Swooped on the boat and tore away the sheet: \n The fluttering sail fell on the fragile mast: \n And groaned the joints. From all the universe \n Commingled perils rushed. In Atlas' seas \n First Corus raised his head, and stirred the depths \n To fury, and had forced upon the rocks \n Whole seas and oceans; but the chilly north \n Drove back the deep that doubted which was lord. \n But Scythian Aquilo prevailed, whose blast \n Tossed up the main and showed as shallow pools \n Each deep abyss; and yet was not the sea \n Heaped on the crags, for Corus' billows met \n The waves of Boreas: such seas had clashed \n Even were the winds withdrawn; Eurus enraged \n Burst from the cave, and Notus black with rain, \n And all the winds from every part of heaven \n Strove for their own; and thus the ocean stayed \n Within his boundaries. No petty seas \n Rapt in the storm are whirled. The Tuscan deep \n Invades th' AEgean ; in Ionian gulfs \n Sounds wandering Hadria . How long the crags \n Which that day fell, the Ocean's blows had braved! \n What lofty peaks did vanquished earth resign! \n And yet on yonder coast such mighty waves \n Took not their rise; from distant regions came \n Those monster billows, driven on their course \n By that great current which surrounds the world. \n \n Thus did the King of Heaven, when length of years \n Wore out the forces of his thunder, call \n His brother's trident to his help, what time \n The earth and sea one second kingdom formed \n And ocean knew no limit but the sky. \n Now, too, the sea had risen to the stars \n In mighty mass, had not Olympus ' chief \n Pressed down its waves with clouds: that night from heaven \n Came not, as others; but the murky air \n Was dim with pallor of the realms below; \n \n The sky lay on the deep; within the clouds \n The waves received the rain : the lightning flash \n Clove through the parted air a path obscured \n By mist and darkness: and the heavenly vaults \n Re-echoed to the tumult, and the frame \n That holds the sky was shaken. Nature feared \n Chaos returned, as though the elements \n Had burst their bonds, and night had come to mix \n Th' infernal shades with heaven. \n In such turmoil \n Not to have perished was their only hope. \n Far as from Leucas point the placid main \n Spreads to the horizon, from the billow's crest \n They viewed the dashing of th' infuriate sea; \n Thence sinking to the middle trough, their mast \n Scarce topped the watery height on either hand, \n Their sails in clouds, their keel upon the ground. \n For all the sea was piled into the waves, \n And drawn from depths between laid bare the sand. \n The master of the boat forgot his art, \n For fear o'ercame; he knew not where to yield \n Or where to meet the wave: but safety came \n From ocean's self at war: one billow forced \n The vessel under, but a huger wave \n Repelled it upwards, and she rode the storm \n Through every blast triumphant. Not the shore \n Of humble Sason , nor Thessalia 's coast \n Indented, not Ambracia 's scanty ports \n Dismayed the mariners, but the giddy tops \n Of high Ceraunia's cliffs. \n But Caesar now, \n Thinking the peril worthy of his fates: \n Are such the labours of the gods? ' exclaimed, \n Bent on my downfall have they sought me thus, \n Here in this puny skiff in such a sea? \n If to the deep the glory of my fall \n Is due, and not to war, intrepid still \n Whatever death they send shall strike me down. \n Let fate cut short the deeds that I would do \n And hasten on the end: the past is mine. \n The northern nations fell beneath my sword; \n 'My dreaded name compels the foe to flee. \n 'Pompeius yields me place; the people's voice \n Gave at my order what the wars denied. \n And all the titles which denote the powers \n Known to the Roman state my name shall bear. \n Let none know this but thou who hear'st my prayers, \n Fortune! that Caesar summoned to the shades, \n Dictator, Consul, full of honours, died \n Ere his last prize was won. I ask no pyre \n Or tomb, ye gods! wherein my dust may rest: \n Nay! plunge in middle deep this battered frame! \n All earth shall look for me, nor shall men cease \n At Caesar's name to fear.' Such words he spake, \n When lo! a tenth gigantic billow raised \n The feeble keel, and where between the rocks \n A cleft gave safety, placed it on the shore. \n Thus in a moment fortune, kingdoms, lands, \n Once more were Caesar's. \n But on his return \n When daylight came, he entered not the camp \n Silent as when he parted; for his friends \n Soon pressed around him, and with weeping eyes \n In accents welcome to his ears began: \n 'Whither in reckless daring hast thou gone, \n Unpitying Caesar? Were these humble lives \n Left here unguarded while thy limbs were given, \n Unsought for, to be scattered by the storm? \n 'When on thy breath so many nations hang \n For life and safety, and so great a world \n Calls thee its master, to have courted death \n Proves want of heart. Were none of all thy friends \n Deserving held to join their fate with thine? \n 'When thou wast tossed upon the stormy main \n We lay in slumber! Shame upon such sleep! \n 'And why thyself didst seek Italia 's shores? \n '\"Twere cruel (such thy thought) to speak the word \n That bade another dare the furious sea. \n All men must bear what chance or fate may bring, \n The sudden peril and the stroke of death; \n But shall the ruler of the world attempt \n 'The raging ocean? With incessant prayers \n Why weary heaven? is it indeed enough \n To crown the war, that Fortune and the deep \n 'Have cast thee on our shores? And wouldst thou use \n 'The grace of favouring deities, to gain \n Not lordship, not the empire of the world, \n 'But lucky shipwreck! ' Night dispersed, and soon \n The sun beamed on them, and the wearied deep, \n The winds permitting, lulled its waves to rest. \n And when Antonius saw a breeze arise \n Fresh from a cloudless heaven, to break the sea, \n He loosed his ships which, by the pilots' hands \n And by the wind in equal order held, \n Swept as a marching host across the main. \n But night unfriendly from the seamen snatched \n All governance of sail, parting the ships \n In divers paths asunder. Like as cranes \n Deserting frozen Strymon for the streams \n Of Nile , when winter falls, in casual lines \n Of wedge-like figures first ascend the sky; \n But when in loftier heaven the southern breeze \n Strikes on their pinions tense, in loose array \n Dispersed at large, in flight irregular, \n They wing their journey onwards. Stronger winds \n With day returning blew the navy on, \n Past Lissus ' shelter which they vainly sought, \n Till bare to northern blasts, Nymphaeum 's port, \n But safe in southern, gave the fleet repose.\n \n \n When Caesar's troops were gathered in their strength \n And Magnus saw the battle day was near \n Before his camp, Cornelia he resolved \n To send to Lesbos ' shore, from rage of fight \n Safe and apart: so lifting from his soul \n The weight that burdened it. Thus, lawful Love, \n Thus art thou tyrant o'er the mightiest mind! \n His spouse was the one cause why Magnus stayed \n Nor met his fortunes, though he staked the world \n And all the destinies of Rome . The word \n He speaks not though resolved; so sweet it seemed, \n When on the future pondering, to gain \n A pause from Fate! But at the close of night, \n When drowsy sleep had fled, Cornelia sought \n To soothe the anxious bosom of her lord \n And win his kisses; when amazed she saw \n His cheek was tearful, and with boding soul \n Shrank from the hidden wound, nor dared surprise \n Magnus in tears. But sighing thus he spake: \n ' Dearer to me than life itself, when life \n 'Is happy (not at moments such as these); \n 'The day of sorrow comes, too long delayed, \n 'Nor long enough! With Caesar at our gates \n ' With all his forces, a secure retreat \n 'Shall Lesbos give thee. Try me not with prayers. \n 'This fatal boon I have denied myself. \n 'Thou wilt not long be absent from thy spouse. \n 'Disasters hasten, and things highest fall \n With speediest ruin. 'Tis enough for thee \n ' To hear of Magnus' peril; and thy love \n 'Deceives thee with the thought that thou canst gaze \n 'Unmoved on civil strife. It shames my soul \n 'On the eve of war to slumber at thy side, \n 'And rise from thy dear breast when trumpets call \n 'A woeful world to misery and arms. \n 'I dread lest Magnus in this war endure \n 'Nor loss nor sorrow. But do thou lie hid \n 'Safer than kings or peoples, far removed; \n 'That so the grievous fortunes of thy lord \n ' May lighter fall on thee. If unkind heaven \n ' Our armies rout, still let my choicest part \n ' Survive in thee; if fated is my flight, \n ' Still leave me that whereto I fain would flee.' \n Hardly at first her senses grasped the words \n In their full misery; then her mind amazed \n Could scarce find utterance for the grief that pressed. \n Nought, Magnus, now is left wherewith to upbraid \n 'The gods and fates of marriage; 'tis not death \n 'That parts our love, nor yet the funeral pyre, \n Nor that dread torch which marks the end of all. \n I share the ignoble lot of vulgar lives: \n 'My spouse rejects me. Yes, the foe is come! \n 'Break we our bonds and Julia's sire appease! - \n Is this thy consort, Magnus, this thy faith \n 'In her fond loving heart? Can danger fright \n 'Her and not thee? Long since our mutual fates \n 'Hang by one chain; and dost thou bid me now \n 'The thunder-bolts of ruin to withstand \n Without thee? Is it well that I should die \n 'Even while you pray for fortune? And suppose \n ' I flee from evil and with death self-sought \n ' Follow thy footsteps to the realms below-- \n ' Am I to live till to that distant isle \n ' Some tardy rumour of thy fall may come? \n ' And then thou say'st, unfeeling! that by use \n ' Strength shall be mine to bear such load of ills \n ' As fate reserves for us: but at such a strength \n ' My spirit trembles. Ah! forgive the truth. \n ' And if the favouring gods shall hear my prayers, \n ' I shall be last to hear the victory \n ' In that lone isle of rocks. When all are glad, \n ' My heart shall throb with anguish, and the sail \n ' Which brings the message I shall see with fear, \n ' Not safe e'en then: for Caesar in his flight \n ' Might seize me there, abandoned and alone \n To be his hostage. If thou place me there, \n The spouse of Magnus, shall not all the world \n 'Well know the secret Mitylene holds? \n This my last prayer: if all is lost but flight, \n 'And thou shalt seek the ocean, to my shores \n 'Turn not thy keel, ill-fated one: for there, \n 'There will they seek thee.' Thus she spoke distraught, \n Leaped from the couch and rushed upon her fate; \n No stop nor stay: she clung not to his neck \n Nor threw her arms about him; both forego \n The last caress, the last fond pledge of love, \n And grief rushed in unchecked upon their souls; \n Still gazing as they part no final words \n Could either utter, and the sweet Farewell \n Remained unspoken. This the saddest day \n Of all their lives: for other woes that came \n More gently struck on hearts inured to grief. \n Borne to the shore with failing limbs she fell \n And grasped the sands, embracing, till at last \n Her maidens placed her senseless in the ship. \n Not in such grief she left her country's shores \n When Caesar's host drew near; for now she leaves, \n Though faithful to her lord, his side in flight \n And flees her spouse. All that next night she waked; \n Then first what means a widowed couch she knew, \n Its cold, its solitude. When slumber found \n Her eyelids, and forgetfulness her soul, \n Seeking with outstretched arms the form beloved, \n She grasps but air. Though tossed by restless love, \n She leaves a place beside her as for him \n Returning. Yet she feared Pompeius lost \n To her for ever. Nay! such happy lot \n The gods prepared not; for the hour drew near \n Which gave her Magnus to her arms again.\n \n "

        "5":{
            "0":"\n Now that the chiefs with minds intent on fight \n Had drawn their armies near upon the hills \n And all the gods beheld their chosen pair, \n Caesar, the Grecian towns despising, scorned \n To reap the glory of successful war \n Save at his kinsman's cost. In all his prayers \n He seeks that moment, fatal to the world, \n When shall be cast the die, to win or lose, \n And all their fortunes hang upon the throw. \n Thrice he drew out his troops, his eagles thrice, \n Demanding battle; to the ruin of Rome \n \n Thus prompt as ever: but his kinsman foe, \n Proof against every art, refused to leave \n The rampart of his camp. Then marching swift \n By hidden path between the wooded fields \n He seeks, and hopes to seize, Dyrrhachium 's fort; \n But Magnus, swifter speeding by the sea, \n First camped on Petra 's slopes, a rocky hill \n Thus by the natives named. From thence he keeps \n Watch o'er the fortress of Corinthian birth \n Which by its towers alone without a guard \n Was safe against a siege. No hand of man \n In ancient days built up her lofty wall, \n No hammer rang upon her massive stones: \n Not all the works of war, nor Time himself \n Shall undermine her. Nature's hand has raised \n Her adamantine rocks and hedged her in \n With bulwarks girded by the foamy main: \n And but for one short bridge of narrow earth \n \n Dyrrhachium were an island. Steep and fierce, \n Dreaded of sailors, are the cliffs that bear \n Her walls; and tempests, howling from the south, \n Toss up the foaming main upon the roofs; \n And homes and temples tremble at the shock. \n Thirsting for battle and with hopes inflamed \n Here Caesar hastes, with distant rampart lines \n Seeking unseen to coop his foe within, \n Though spread in spacious camp upon the hills. \n With eagle eye he measures out the land \n Meet to be compassed, nor content with turf \n Fit for a hasty mound, he bids his troops \n Tear from the quarries many a giant rock: \n And spoils the dwellings of the Greeks, and drags \n Their walls asunder for his own. Thus rose \n A mighty barrier which no ram could burst \n Nor any ponderous machine of war. \n Mountains are cleft, and level through the hills \n The work of Caesar strides : wide yawns the moat, \n Forts show their towers rising on the heights, \n And in vast circle forests are enclosed \n And groves and spacious lands, and beasts of prey, \n As in a line of toils. Pompeius lacked \n Nor field nor forage in th' encircled span \n Nor room to move his camp; nay, rivers rose \n Within, and ran their course and reached the sea; \n And Caesar wearied ere he saw the whole, \n And daylight failed him. Let the ancient tale \n Attribute to the labours of the gods \n The walls of Ilium : let the fragile bricks \n Which compass in great Babylon , amaze \n The fleeting Parthian. Here a larger space \n Than those great cities which Orontes swift \n And Tigris ' stream enclose, or that which boasts \n In Eastern climes, the lordly palaces \n Fit for Assyria's kings, is closed by walls \n Amid the haste and tumult of a war \n Forced to completion. Yet this labour huge \n Was spent in vain. So many hands had joined \n Or Sestos with Abydos , or had tamed \n With mighty mole the Hellespontine wave, \n Or Corinth from the realm of Pelops king \n Had rent asunder, or had spared each ship \n Her voyage round the long Malean cape, \n Or had done anything most hard, to mould \n The world's created surface. Here the war \n Was prisoned: blood predestinate to flow \n In all the parts of earth; the host foredoomed \n To fall in Libya or in Thessaly \n \n Was here: in such small amphitheatre \n The tide of civil passion rose and fell. \n At first Pompeius knew not: so the hind \n Who peaceful tills the mid-Sicilian fields \n Hears not Pelorus sounding to the storm; \n So billows thunder on Rutupian shores, \n \n Unheard by distant Caledonia 's tribes. \n But when he saw the mighty barrier stretch \n O'er hill and valley, and enclose the land, \n He bade his columns leave their rocky hold \n And seize on posts of vantage in the plain; \n Thus forcing Caesar to extend his troops \n On wider lines; and holding for his own \n Such space encompassed as divides from Rome \n \n \n Aricia , sacred to that goddess chaste \n Of old Mycenae ; or as Tiber holds \n From Rome 's high ramparts to the Tuscan sea, \n Unless he deviate. No trumpet call \n Commands an onset, and the darts that fly \n Fly though forbidden; but the arm that flings \n For proof the lance, at random, here and there \n Deals impious slaughter. Weighty care compelled \n Each leader to withhold his troops from fight; \n For there the weary earth of produce failed \n Pressed by Pompeius' steeds, whose horny hoofs \n Rang in their gallop on the grassy fields \n And killed the succulence. They strengthless lay \n Upon the mown expanse, nor pile of straw, \n Brought from full barns in place of living grass, \n Relieved their craving; shook their panting flanks, \n And as they wheeled Death struck his victim down. \n Then foul contagion filled the murky air \n Whose poisonous weight pressed on them in a cloud \n Pestiferous; as in Nesis' isle the breath \n Of Styx rolls upwards from the mist-clad rocks; \n Or that fell vapour which the caves exhale \n From Typhon raging in the depths below. \n Then died the soldiers, for the streams they drank \n Held yet more poison than the air: the skin \n Was dark and rigid, and the fiery plague \n Made hard their vitals, and with pitiless tooth \n Gnawed at their wasted features, while their eyes \n Started from out their sockets, and the head \n Drooped from sheer weariness. So the disease \n Grew swifter in its strides till scarce was room, \n 'Twixt life and death, for sickness, and the pest \n Slew as it struck its victim, and the dead \n Thrust from the tents (such all their burial) lay \n Blent with the living. Yet their camp was pitched \n Hard by the breezy sea by which might come \n All nations' harvests, and the northern wind \n Not seldom rolled the murky air away. \n Their foe, not vexed with pestilential air \n Nor stagnant waters, ample range enjoyed \n Upon the spacious uplands: yet as though \n In leaguer, famine seized them for its prey. \n Scarce were the crops half grown when Caesar saw \n How prone they seized upon the food of beasts, \n And stripped of leaves the bushes and the groves, \n And dragged from roots unknown the doubtful herb, \n Which might be death: all things they ate that fire \n May soften, or teeth may bite, or arid throat \n May swallow; things that never heretofore \n Were placed on tables-thus the host at large- \n Yet was there plenty with the leaguered foe.\n \n \n When Magnus first was pleased to break his bonds, \n No nightly dash he makes, by craft to seize \n His sleeping foe unarmed: his soul had scorned \n Such path obscure to victory. Twas his aim, \n To lay the turrets low; to mark his track, \n By ruin spread afar; and with the sword \n To hew a path between his slaughtered foes. \n Minucius' turret was the chosen spot \n Where groves of trees and thickets gave approach \n Safe, unbetrayed by dust. Up from the fields \n Flashed all at once his eagles into sight \n And all his trumpets blared. But ere the sword \n Could win the battle, on the hostile ranks \n Dread panic fell; prone as in death they lay \n Where else upright they should withstand the foe; \n Nor more availed their valour, and in vain \n The cloud of weapons flew, with none to slay. \n Then blazing torches rolling pitchy flame \n Are hurled, and shaken nod the lofty towers \n And threaten ruin, and the bastions groan \n Struck by the frequent engine, and the troops \n Of Magnus by triumphant eagles led \n Stride o'er the rampart, in their front the world. \n Yet now that passage which not Caesar's self \n Nor thousand valiant squadrons had availed \n To rescue from their grasp, one man in arms \n Steadfast till death refused them; Scaeva named \n This hero soldier: long he served in fight \n Waged 'gainst the savage on the banks of Rhone ; \n And now centurion made, through deeds of blood, \n He bore the staff before the marshalled line. \n Prone to all wickedness, he little recked \n How valourous deeds in civil war may be \n Greatest of crimes; and when he saw how turned \n His comrades fron the war and sought in flight \n A refuge, ' Whence,' he cried, 'this impious fear \n Unknown to Caesar's armies? Do ye turn \n 'Your backs on death, and are ye not ashamed \n Not to be found where slaughtered heroes lie? \n 'Is loyalty too weak? Yet love of fight \n 'Might bid you stand. We are the chosen few \n 'Through whom the foe would break. Unbought by blood \n 'This day shall not be theirs. 'Neath Caesar's eye, \n 'True, death would be more happy; but this boon \n 'Fortune denies: at least my fall shall be \n 'Praised by Pompeius. Shatter with your breasts \n ' Their weapons; blunt the edges of their swords \n ' With throats unyielding. In the distant lines \n ' The dust is seen already, and the sound \n ' Of tumult and of ruin finds the ear \n Of Caesar: strike; the victory is ours: \n 'For he shall come who while his soldiers die \n Shall make the fortress his.' His voice calls forth \n The courage that the trumpets failed to rouse \n When first they rang: his comrades mustering come \n To watch his deeds; and, wondering at the man, \n To test if valour thus by foes oppressed, \n In narrow space, could hope for aught but death. \n But Scaeva standing on the tottering bank \n Heaves from the brimming turret on the foe \n The corpses of the fallen; the ruined mass \n Gives weapons to his hands; with beams and poles \n And ponderous stones, with his own breast he threats \n His enemies; and thrusts with mighty stakes \n The host advancing; when they grasp the wall \n He lops the arm: rocks crush the foeman's skull \n And rive the scalp asunder: fiery bolts \n Dashed at another set his hair aflame, \n Till rolls the greedy blaze about his eyes \n With hideous crackle. As the pile of slain \n Rose to the summit of the wall he sprang, \n Swift as across the nets a hunted pard, \n Above the swords upraised, till in mid throng \n Of foes he stood, hemmed in by densest ranks \n And ramparted by war; in front and rear, \n Where'er he struck, the victor. Now his sword \n Blunted with gore congealed no more could wound, \n But brake the stricken limb; while every hand \n Flung every quivering dart at him alone; \n Nor missed their aim, for rang against his shield \n Dart after dart unerring, and his helm \n In broken fragments pressed upon his brow; \n His vital parts were safeguarded by spears \n That bristled in his body. Fortune saw \n Thus waged a novel combat, for there warred \n Against one man an army. Why with darts, \n Madmen, assail him and with slender shafts, \n 'Gainst which his life is proof? Or ponderous stones \n This warrior chief shall overwhelm, or bolts \n Flung by the twisted thongs of mighty slings. \n Let steel-shod ram or catapult remove \n This champion of the gate. No fragile wall \n Stands here for Caesar, blocking with its bulk \n Pompeius' way to freedom. Now he trusts \n His shield no more, lest his sinister hand, \n Idle, give life by shame; and on his breast \n Bearing a forest of spears, though spent with toil \n And worn with onset, falls upon his foe \n And braves alone the wounds of all the war. \n Thus may an elephant in Afric wastes, \n Oppressed by frequent darts, break those that fall \n Rebounding from his horny hide, and shake \n Those that find lodgment, while his life within \n Lies safe, protected, nor does spear avail \n To reach the fount of blood. Unnumbered wounds \n By arrow dealt, or lance, thus fail to slay \n This single warrior. But lo! from far \n A Cretan archer's shaft, more sure of aim \n Than vows could hope for, strikes on Scaeva's brow \n To light within his eye: the hero tugs \n Intrepid, bursts the nerves, and tears the shaft \n Forth with the eyeball, and with dauntless heel \n Treads them to dust. Not otherwise a bear \n Pannonian, fiercer for the wound received, \n Maddened by dart from Libyan thong propelled, \n Turns circling on her wound, and still pursues \n The weapon fleeing as she whirls around. \n Thus, in his rage destroyed, his shapeless face \n Stood foul with crimson flow. The victors' shout \n Glad to the sky arose; no greater joy \n A little blood could give them had they seen \n That Caesar's self was wounded. Down he pressed \n Deep in his soul the anguish, and, with mien \n No longer bent on fight, submissive cried, \n Spare me, ye citizens; remove the war \n Far hence: no weapons now can haste my death; \n Draw from my breast the darts, but add no more. \n Yet raise me up to place me in the camp \n Of Magnus, living: this your gift to him; \n No brave man's death my title to renown, \n But Caesar's flag deserted.' So he spake. \n Unhappy Aulus thought his words were true, \n Nor saw within his hand the ready sword; \n And leaping forth in haste to make his own \n The prisoner and his arms, in middle throat \n Received the lightning blade. By this one death \n Rose Scaeva's valour again; and thus he cried, \n Such be the punishment of all who thought \n Great Scaeva vanquished; if Pompeius seeks \n Peace from this reeking sword, low let him lay \n ' At Caesar's feet his standards. Me do ye think \n ' Such as yourselves, and slow to meet the fates? \n 'Your love for Magnus and the Senate's cause \n 'Is less than mine for death.' These were his words; \n And dust in columns proved that Caesar came. \n Thus was Pompeius' glory spared the stain \n Of flight compelled by Scava. He, when ceased \n The battle, fell, no more by rage of fight, \n Or sight of blood out-pouring from his wounds, \n Roused to the combat. Fainting there he lay \n Upon the shoulders of his comrades borne, \n Who him adoring (as though deity \n Dwelt in his bosom) for his matchless deeds, \n Plucked forth the gory shafts and took his arms \n To deck the gods and shield the breast of Mars. \n Thrice happy thou with such a name achieved, \n Had but the fierce Iberian from thy sword, \n Or heavy shielded Teuton, or had fled \n The light Cantabrian: now no spoils of thine \n Shall deck the Thunderer's temple, nor upraise \n The shout of triumph in the ways of Rome . \n For all thy prowess, all thy deeds of pride \n Do but prepare her lord.\n \n \n Nor on this hand \n Repulsed, Pompeius idly ceased from war, \n Content within his bars; but as the sea \n Tireless, which tempests force upon the crag \n That breaks it, or which gnaws a mountain side \n Some day to fall in ruin on itself; \n He sought the turrets nearest to the main, \n On double onset bent; nor closely kept \n His troops in hand, but on the spacious plain \n Spread forth his camp. They joyful leave the tents \n And wander at their will. Thus Padus flows \n In brimming flood, and foaming at his bounds, \n Making whole districts quake; and should the bank \n Fail 'neath his swollen waters, all his stream \n Breaks forth in swirling eddies over fields \n Not his before; some lands are lost, the rest \n Gain from his bounty. \n Hardly from his tower \n Had Caesar seen the fire or known the fight: \n And coming found the rampart overthrown, \n The dust no longer stirred, the ruins cold \n As from a battle done. The peace that reigned \n There and on Magnus' side, as though men slept, \n Their victory won, aroused his angry soul. \n Quick he prepares, so that he end their joy \n Careless of slaughter or defeat, to rush \n With threatening columns on Torquatus' post. \n But swift as sailor, by his trembling mast \n Warned of Circeian tempest, furls his sails, \n So swift Torquatus saw, and prompt to wage \n The war more closely, he withdrew his men \n Within a narrower wall. \n Now past the trench \n Were Caesar's companies, when from the hills \n Pompeius hurled his host upon their ranks \n Shut in, and hampered. Not so much o'erwhelmed \n As Caesar's soldiers is the hind who dwells \n On Etna 's slopes, when blows the southern wind, \n And all the mountain pours its cauldrons forth \n Upon the vale; and huge Enceladus \n \n Writhing beneath his load spouts o'er the plains \n A blazing torrent. Blinded by the dust, \n Encircled, vanquished, ere the fight, they fled \n In cloud of terror on their rearward foe, \n So rushing on their fates. Thus had the war \n Shed its last drop of blood and peace ensued, \n But Magnus suffered not, and held his troops \n Back from the battle. \n Thou, O Rome , hadst been \n Free, happy, mistress of thy laws and rights \n Were Sulla here. Now shalt thou ever grieve \n That in his crowning crime, to have met in fight \n A pious kinsman, Caesar's vantage lay. \n Oh tragic destiny! Nor Munda's fight \n \n Hispania had wept, nor Libya mourned \n Encrimsoned Utica, nor Nilus' stream, \n With blood unspeakable polluted, borne \n A nobler corse than her Egyptian kings: \n Nor Juba lain unburied on the sands, \n Nor Scipio with his blood outpoured appeased \n The ghosts of Carthage ; this had been thy last \n Disaster, Rome ; nor had the blameless life \n Of Cato ended: and Pharsalia's name \n Had so been blotted from the book of fate. \n But Caesar left the region where his arms \n Had found the deities adverse, and marched \n His shattered columns to Thessalian lands. \n Then to Pompeius came (whose mind was bent \n To follow Caesar wheresoe'er he fled) \n His captains, striving to persuade their chief \n To seek Ausonia, his native land, \n Now freed from foes. 'Ne'er will I pass,' he said, \n ' My country's limit, nor revisit Rome \n \n ' Like Caesar, at the head of banded hosts. \n \n ' Hesperia when the war began was mine; \n ' Mine, had I chosen in our country's shrines, \n ' In midmost forum of her capital, \n ' To join the battle. So that banished far \n ' Be war from Rome , I'll cross the torrid zone \n ' Or those for ever frozen Scythian shores. \n What! shall my victory rob thee of the peace \n I gave thee by my flight? Rather than thou \n Shouldst feel the evils of this impious war, \n 'Let Caesar deem thee his.' He turned his course \n Towards the uprising sun, and sought by paths \n Remote, and forests wide, the land by fate \n Foredoomed to see the issue of the war. \n \n Thessalia on that side where Titan first \n Raises the wintry day, by Ossa 's rocks \n Is prisoned in: but in th' advancing year \n When higher in the vault his chariot rides \n 'Tis Pelion that meets the morning rays. \n And when beside the Lion's flames he drives \n The middle course, Othrys with woody top \n Screens his chief ardour. On the hither side \n Pindus receives the breezes of the west \n And as the evening falls brings darkness in. \n There too Olympus , at whose foot who dwells \n Nor fears the north nor sees the shining bear. \n Between these mountains hemmed, in ancient time \n The fields were marsh, for Tempe 's pass not yet \n Was cleft, to give an exit to the streams \n That filled the plain: but when Alcides' hand \n Smote Ossa from Olympus at a blow, \n \n And Nereus wondered at the sudden flood \n Of waters to the main, then on the shore \n (Would it had slept for ever 'neath the deep) \n Seaborn Achilles' home Pharsalus rose; \n And Phylace whence sailed that ship of old \n Whose keel first touched upon the beach of Troy ; \n And Dorion mournful for the Muses' ire \n On Thamyris vanquished: Trachis ; Melibe \n Strong in the shafts of Hercules, the price \n Of that most awful torch; Larissa's hold \n Potent of yore; and Argos , famous erst, \n O'er which men pass the ploughshare: and the spot \n Fabled as Echionian Thebes , where once \n Agave bore in exile to the pyre \n (Grieving 'twas all she had) the head and neck \n Of Pentheus massacred. The lake set free \n Flowed forth in many rivers: to the west \n AEas, a gentle stream; nor stronger flows \n The sire of Isis ravished from his arms; \n And Achelous, rival for the hand \n Of OEneus' daughter, rolls his earthy flood \n \n To silt the shore beside the neighbouring isles. \n Evenus purpled by the Centaur's blood \n Wanders through Calydon: in the Malian Gulf \n Thy rapids fall, Spercheius: pure the wave \n With which Amphrysos irrigates the meads \n Where once Apollo served: Anaurus flows \n Breathing no vapour forth; no humid air \n Ripples his surface: and whatever stream, \n Nameless itself, to Ocean gives its waves \n Through thee, Peneus: whirled in eddies foams \n Apidanus; Enipeus lingers on \n Swift only when fresh streams his volume swell: \n And thus Asopus takes his ordered course, \n Phoenix and Melas ; but Eurotas keeps \n His stream aloof from that with which he flows, \n Peneus, gliding on his top as though \n Upon the channel. Fable says that, sprung \n From darkest pools of Styx, with common floods \n He scorns to mingle, mindful of his source, \n So that the gods above may fear him still. \n Soon as were sped the rivers, Boebian ploughs \n Dark with its riches broke the virgin soil; \n Then came Lelegians to press the share, \n And Dolopes and sons of AEolus \n By whom the glebe was furrowed. Steed-renowned \n Magnetians dwelt there, and the Minyan race \n Who smote the sounding billows with the oar. \n There in the cavern from the pregnant cloud \n Ixion's sons found birth, the Centaur brood \n Half beast, half human: Monychus who broke \n The stubborn rocks of Pholoe, Rhoetus fierce \n Hurling from OEta's top gigantic elms \n Which northern storms could hardly overturn; \n Pholus, Alcides' host: Nessus who bore \n The Queen across Evenus' waves, to feel \n The deadly arrow for his shameful deed; \n And aged Chiron who with wintry star \n Against the huger Scorpion draws his bow. \n Here sparkled on the land the warrior seed; \n \n Here leaped the charger from Thessalian rocks \n \n Struck by the trident of the Ocean King, \n Omen of dreadful war; here first he learned, \n Champing the bit and foaming at the curb, \n Yet to obey his lord. From yonder shore \n The keel of pine first floated, and bore men \n To dare the perilous chance of seas unknown: \n And here Ionus ruler of the land \n First from the furnace molten masses drew \n Of iron and brass; here first the hammer fell \n To weld them, shapeless; here in glowing stream \n Ran silver forth and gold, soon to receive \n The minting stamp. 'Twas thus that money came \n Whereby men count their riches, cause accursed \n Of warfare. Hence came down that Python huge \n On Cirrha : hence the laurel wreath which crowns \n The Pythian victor: here Aloeus' sons \n Gigantic rose against the gods, what time \n \n Pelion had almost touched the stars supreme, \n And Ossa's loftier peak amid the sky \n Opposing, barred the constellations' way.\n \n \n When in this fated land the chiefs had placed \n Their several camps, foreboding of the end \n Now fast approaching, all men's thoughts were turned \n Upon the final issue of the war. \n And as the end drew near, all coward minds \n Trembling beneath the shadow of the fate \n Now hanging o'er them, deemed disaster near: \n While some took heart; yet doubted what might fall, \n In hope and fear alternate. 'Mid the throng \n Sextus, unworthy son of worthy sire \n Who soon upon the waves that Scylla guards, \n \n Sicilian pirate, exile from his home, \n Stained by his deeds of shame the fights he won, \n Could bear delay no more; his feeble soul, \n Sick of uncertain fate, by fear compelled, \n Forecast the future: yet consulted not \n The shrine of Delos nor the Pythian caves; \n Nor was he satisfied to learn the sound \n Of Jove's brass cauldron, 'mid Dodona 's oaks, \n By her primaeval fruits the nurse of men: \n Nor sought he sages who by flight of birds, \n Or watching with Assyrian care the stars \n And fires of heaven, or by victims slain, \n May know the fates to come; nor any source \n Lawful though secret. For to him was known \n That which excites the hate of gods above; \n Magicians' lore, the savage creed of Dis \n And all the shades; and sad with gloomy rites \n Mysterious altars. For his frenzied soul \n Heaven knew too little. And the spot itself \n Kindled his madness, for hard by there dwelt \n The brood of Haemon whom no storied witch \n Of fiction e'er transcended; all their art \n In things most strange and most incredible; \n There were Thessalian rocks with deadly herbs \n Thick planted, sensible to magic chants, \n Funereal, secret: and the land was full \n Of violence to the gods: the Queenly guest \n \n From Colchis gathered here the fatal roots \n That were not in her store: hence vain to heaven \n Rise impious incantations, all unheard; \n For deaf the ears divine: save for one voice \n Which penetrates the furthest depths of air \n Compelling e'en th' unwilling deities \n To hearken to its accents. Not the care \n Of the revolving sky or starry pole \n Can call them from it ever. Once the sound \n Of those dread tones unspeakable has reached \n The constellations, then nor Babylon \n \n Nor secret Memphis , though they open wide \n The shrines of ancient magic and entreat \n The gods, could draw them from the fires that smoke \n Upon the altars of far Thessaly . \n To hearts of flint those incantations bring \n Love, strange, unnatural; the old man's breast \n Burns with illicit fire. Nor lies the power \n In harmful cup nor in the juicy pledge \n Of love maternal from the forehead drawn; \n \n Charmed forth by spells alone the mind decays, \n By poisonous drugs unharmed. With woven threads \n Crossed in mysterious fashion do they bind \n Those whom no passion born of beauteous form \n Or loving couch unites. All things on earth \n Change at their bidding; night usurps the day; \n The heavens disobey their wonted laws; \n At that dread hymn the Universe stands still; \n And Jove while urging the revolving wheels \n Wonders they move not. Torrents are outpoured \n Beneath a burning sun; and thunder roars \n Uncaused by Jupiter. From their flowing locks \n Vapours immense shall issue at their call; \n When falls the tempest seas shall rise and foam \n \n Moved by their spell; though powerless the breeze \n To raise the billows. Ships against the wind \n With bellying sails move onward. From the rock \n Hangs motionless the torrent: rivers run \n Uphill; the summer heat no longer swells \n \n Nile in his course; Maeander 's stream is straight; \n Slow Rhone is quickened by the rush of Saone ; \n Hills dip their heads and topple to the plain; \n \n Olympus sees his clouds drift overhead; \n And sunless Scythia 's sempiternal snows \n Melt in mid-winter; the inflowing tides \n Driven onward by the moon, at that dread chant \n Ebb from their course; earth's axes, else unmoved, \n Have trembled, and the force centripetal \n Has tottered, and the earth's compacted frame \n Struck by their voice has gaped, till through the void \n Men saw the moving sky. All beasts most fierce \n And savage fear them, yet with deadly aid \n Furnish the witches' arts. Tigers athirst \n For blood, and noble lions on them fawn \n With bland caresses: serpents at their word \n Uncoil their circles, and extended glide \n Along the surface of the frosty field; \n The viper's severed body joins anew; \n And dies the snake by human venom slain. \n Whence comes this labour on the gods, compelled \n To hearken to the magic chant and spells, \n Nor daring to despise them? Doth some bond \n Control the deities? Is their pleasure so, \n Or must they listen? and have silent threats \n Prevailed, or piety unseen received \n So great a guerdon? Against all the gods \n Is this their influence, or on one alone \n Who to his will constrains the universe, \n Himself constrained? Stars most in yonder clime \n Shoot headlong from the zenith; and the moon \n Gliding serene upon her nightly course \n Is shorn of lustre by their poisonous chant, \n Dimmed by dark earthly fires, as though our orb \n Shadowed her brother's radiance and barred \n The light bestowed by heaven; nor freshly shines \n Until descending nearer to the earth \n She sheds her baneful drops upon the mead.\n \n \n These sinful rites and these her sister's songs \n Abhorred Erichtho, fiercest of the race, \n Spurned for their piety, and yet viler art \n Practised in novel form. To her no home \n Beneath a sheltering roof-her direful head \n Thus to lay down were crime: deserted tombs \n Her dwelling-place, from which, darling of hell, \n She dragged the dead. Nor life nor gods forbad \n But that she knew the secret homes of Styx \n And learned to hear the whispered voice of ghosts \n At dread mysterious meetings. Never sun \n Shed his pure light upon that haggard cheek \n Pale with the pallor of the shades, nor looked \n Upon those locks unkempt that crowned her brow. \n In starless nights of tempest crept the hag \n Out from her tomb to seize the levin bolt; \n Treading the harvest with accursed foot \n She burned the fruitful growth, and with her breath \n Poisoned the air else pure. No prayer she breathed \n Nor supplication to the gods, nor knew \n The pulse of entrails : logs from flaming pyres \n She loves to cast on altars of the gods, \n And incense pilfered from the smoking tomb. \n The gods at her first utterance grant her prayer \n For things unlawful, lest they hear again \n Its fearful accents: men whose limbs were quick \n With vital power she thrust within the grave \n Despite the fates who owed them years to come: \n The funeral reversed brought from the tomb \n Those who were dead no longer; and the pyre \n Yields to her shameless clutch still smoking dust \n And bones enkindled, torches which but now \n Some grieving father held, and fragments mixed \n In sable smoke and ceremental cloths \n Singed with the redolent fire that burned the dead. \n But those who lie within a stony cell \n Untouched by fire, whose dried and mummied frames \n No longer know corruption, limb by limb \n Venting her rage she tears, the bloodless eyes \n Drags from their cavities, and mauls the nail \n Upon the withered hand: she gnaws the noose \n By which some wretch has died, and from the tree \n Drags down a pendent corpse, its members torn \n Asunder to the winds: forth from the palms \n Wrenches the iron, and from the unbending bond \n Hangs by her teeth, and with her hands collects \n The slimy gore which drips upon the limbs. \n Where lay a corpse upon the naked earth \n On ravening birds and beasts of prey the hag \n Kept watch, nor marred by knife or hand her spoil, \n Till on his victim seized some nightly wolf; \n \n Then dragged the morsel from his thirsty fangs; \n Nor fears she murder, if some banquet fell \n Need blood fresh issued from the gaping throat, \n Or panting entrail. By unnatural means \n Wombs yield to her the infant to be placed \n On glowing altars: and whene'er she needs \n Some fierce undaunted ghost, he fails not her \n Who has all deaths in use. Her hand has chased \n From smiling cheeks the rosy bloom of life; \n And with sinister hand from dying youth \n Has shorn the fatal lock: and holding oft \n In foul embraces some departed friend \n Severed the head, and through the ghastly lips, \n Held by her own apart, some impious tale \n Dark with mysterious horror hath conveyed \n Down to the darkness of the Stygian shades. \n When Sextus first, through rumours of the place, \n Heard of the hag, what time beneath the earth \n Titan was wheeling at full height, and here \n Night in mid course, in quest of her he trod \n Through desert fields. Meanwhile a faithful band, \n His ministers of guilt, mid tombs and vaults \n All ruined wandering, beheld the witch \n Seated afar upon a lofty crag \n Where Haemus reaches out Pharsalian spurs. \n \n There was she proving for her gods and priests \n Of magic, words unknown, and framing chants \n Of dire and novel purpose : for she feared \n Lest Mars should stray into another world, \n And spare Thessalian soil the blood ere long \n To flow in torrents; and thus she forbade \n \n Philippi 's field, polluted with her song, \n Thick with her poisonous distilments sown, \n To let the war pass by. Such deaths, she hopes, \n Soon shall be hers! the blood of all the world \n Shed for her use! to her it shall be given \n To sever from their trunks the heads of kings, \n Plunder the ashes of the noble dead, \n \n Italia 's bravest, and in triumph add \n The mightiest warriors to her host of shades. \n This her sole toil, from Magnus' tombless corse \n What she may snatch, on which of Caesar's limbs \n Her grasp may fasten. \n To whom the coward son \n Of Magnus thus: 'Thou greatest ornament \n Of Haemon's daughters, in whose power it lies \n Or to reveal the fates, or from its course \n 'To turn the future, be it mine to know \n 'By thy sure utterance to what final end \n 'Fortune now guides the issue. Not the least \n 'Of all the Roman host on yonder plain \n Am I, but Magnus' most illustrious son, \n Lord of the world or heir to death and doom. \n 'The unknown affrights me: I can firmly face \n The certain terror. Bid my destiny \n Yield to thy power the dark and hidden end, \n And let me fall foreknowing. From the gods \n Extort the truth, or, if thou spare the gods, \n Force it from hell itself. Fling back the gates \n That bar th' Elysian fields; let Death confess \n 'Whom from our ranks he seeks. No humble task \n I bring, but worthy of Erichtho's skill \n Of such a struggle fought for such a prize \n To search and tell the issue.' \n Then the witch \n Pleased that her impious fame was noised abroad \n Thus made her answer : 'If some lesser fates \n 'Thy wish had been to change, against their wish \n 'It had been easy to compel the gods \n 'To its accomplishment. My art has power \n When of one man the constellations press \n The speedy death, to compass a delay;. \n And mine it is, though every star decrees \n A ripe old age, by mystic herbs to shear \n The life midway. But should some purpose set \n From the beginning of the universe, \n And all the labouring fortunes of mankind, \n 'Be brought in question, then Thessalian art \n 'Bows to the power supreme. But if thou be \n Content to know the issue pre-ordained, \n 'Simple the task and plain; for earth and air \n And sea and space and Rhodopaean crags \n 'Shall speak the future. Yet it easiest seems \n Where death in these Thessalian fields abounds \n \n 'To raise a single corpse. From dead men's lips \n Scarce cold, in fuller accents falls the voice; \n Not from some mummied frame in accents shrill \n Uncertain to the ear.'\n \n \n Thus spake the hag \n And through redoubled night, a squalid veil \n Swathing her pallid features, stole among \n Unburied carcases. Fast fled the wolves, \n The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied \n Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step \n She sought her prophet. Firm must be the flesh \n As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs \n Untouched by wound. Now in the balance hung \n The fates of slain unnumbered; had she striven \n Armies to raise and order back to life \n Whole ranks of warriors, the laws had failed \n Of Erebus; and, summoned up from Styx , \n Its ghostly tenants had obeyed her call, \n And rising fought once more. At length the witch \n Picks out her victim with pierced throat agape \n Fit for her purpose. Gripped by pitiless hook \n O'er rocks she drags him to the mountain cave \n Accursed by her fell rites, that shall restore \n The dead man's life. Close to the hidden brink \n The land that girds the precipice of hell \n Sinks towards the depths: with ever falling leaves \n A wood o'ershadows, and a spreading yew \n Casts shade impenetrable. Foul decay \n Fills all the space, and in the deep recess \n Darkness unbroken, save by chanted spells, \n Reigns ever. Not where gape the misty jaws \n Of caverned Taenarus, the gloomy bound \n Of either world, through which the nether kings \n Permit the passage of the dead to earth, \n So poisonous, mephitic, hangs the air. \n Nay, though the witch had power to call the shades \n Forth from the depths, 'twas doubtful if the cave \n Were not a part of hell. Discordant hues \n Flamed on her garb as by a fury worn; \n Bare was her visage, and upon her brow \n Dread vipers hissed, beneath her streaming locks \n In sable coils entwined. But when she saw \n The youth's companions trembling, and himself \n With eyes cast down, with visage as of death, \n Thus spake the witch: ' Forbid your craven souls \n 'These fears to cherish: soon returning life \n 'This frame shall quicken, and in tones which reach \n Even the timorous ear shall speak the man. \n 'If I have power the Stygian lakes to show, \n The bank that sounds with fire, the fury band, \n 'And giants fettered, and the hound that shakes \n 'Bristling with heads of snakes his triple head, \n What fear is this that cringes at the sight \n Of timid shivering shades? ' \n Then to her prayer. \n First through his gaping bosom blood she pours \n Still fervent, washing from his wounds the gore. \n Then copious poisons from the moon distils \n Mixed with all monstrous things which Nature's pangs \n Bring to untimely birth; the froth from dogs \n Stricken with madness, foaming at the stream; \n A lynx's entrails: and the knot that grows \n Upon the fell hyaena; flesh of stags \n Fed upon serpents; and the sucking fish \n Which holds the vessel back though eastern winds \n Make bend the canvas; dragon's eyes; and stones \n That sound beneath the brooding eagle's wings. \n Nor Araby 's viper, nor the ocean snake \n Who in the Red Sea waters guards the shell, \n Are wanting; nor the slough on Libyan sands \n By horned reptile cast; nor ashes fail \n Snatched from an altar where the Phoenix died. \n And viler poisons many, which herself \n Has made, she adds, whereto no name is given: \n Pestiferous leaves pregnant with magic chants \n And blades of grass which in their primal growth \n Her cursed mouth had slimed. Last came her voice \n More potent than all herbs to charm the gods \n Who rule in Lethe. Dissonant murmurs first \n And sounds discordant from the tongues of men \n She utters, scarce articulate: the bay \n Of wolves, and barking as of dogs, were mixed \n With that fell chant; the screech of nightly owl \n Raising her hoarse complaint; the howl of beast \n And sibilant hiss of snake-all these were there; \n And more-the wail of waters on the rock, \n The sound of forests and the thunder peal. \n Such was her voice; but soon in clearer tones \n Reaching to Tartarus, she raised her song: \n ' Ye awful goddesses, avenging power \n ' Of Hell upon the damned, and Chaos huge \n ' Who striv'st to mix innumerable worlds, \n ' And Pluto, king of earth, whose weary soul \n ' Grieves at his godhead; Styx ; and plains of bliss \n ' We may not enter: and thou, Proserpine, \n ' Hating thy mother and the skies above, \n ' My patron goddess, last and lowest form \n \n ' Of Hecate, through whom the shades and I \n ' Hold silent converse; warder of the gate \n ' Who castest human offal to the dog: \n ' Ye sisters who shall spin the threads again; \n \n ' And thou, O boatman of the burning wave, \n ' Now wearied of the shades from hell to me \n ' Returning, hear me if with voice I cry \n ' Abhorred, polluted; if the flesh of man \n ' Hath ne'er been absent from my proffered song, \n Flesh washed with brains still quivering; if the child \n Whose severed head I placed upon the dish \n But for this hand had lived-a listening ear \n Lend to my supplication! From the caves \n 'Hid in the innermost recess of hell \n ' I claim no soul long banished from the light. \n ' For one but now departed, lingering still \n ' Upon the brink of Orcus, is my prayer. \n Grant (for ye may) that listening to the spell \n 'Once more he seek his dust; and let the shade \n Of this our soldier perished (if the war \n Well at your hands has merited), proclaim \n The destiny of Magnus to his son.' \n Such prayers she uttered; then upraised her head \n And foaming lips, and present saw the ghost. \n Hard by he stood, beside the hated corpse \n His ancient prison, and loathed to enter in. \n There was the yawning chest where fell the blow \n That was his death; and yet the gift supreme \n Of death, his right, (Ah, wretch! ) was reft away. \n Angered at Death the witch, and at the pause \n Conceded by the fates, with living snake \n Scourges the nerveless corse; and on the dead \n She barks through fissures gaping to her song, \n Breaking the silence of their gloomy home: \n ' Tisiphone, Megaera, heed ye not? \n Flies not this wretched soul before your whips \n ' The void of Erebus? By your very names, \n ' She-dogs of hell, I'll call you to the day, \n Not to return; through sepulchres and death \n Your gaoler: from funereal urns and tombs \n I'll chase you forth. And thou, too, Hecate, \n Who to the gods in comely shape and mien, \n Not that of Erebus, appear'st, henceforth \n Wasted and pallid as thou art in hell \n 'At my command shalt come. I'll noise abroad \n The banquet that beneath the solid earth \n Holds thee, thou maid of Enna ; by what bond \n 'Thou lov'st night's King, by what mysterious stain \n Infected, so that Ceres fears from hell \n 'To call her daughter. And for thee, base king, \n 'Titan shall pierce thy caverns with his rays \n And sudden day shall smite thee. Do ye hear? \n 'Or shall I summon to mine aid that god \n 'At whose dread name earth trembles; who can look \n Unflinching on the Gorgon's head, and drive \n 'The Furies with his scourge, who holds the depths \n ' Ye cannot fathom, and above whose haunts \n Ye dwell supernal; who by waves of Styx \n \n Forswears himself unpunished? '\n \n \n Then the blood \n Grew warm and liquid, and with softening touch \n Cherished the stiffened wounds and filled the veins, \n Till throbbed once more the slow returning pulse \n And every fibre trembled, as with death \n Life was commingled. Then, not limb by limb, \n With toil and strain, but rising at a bound \n Leaped from the earth erect the living man. \n Fierce glared his eyes uncovered, and the life \n Was dim, and still upon his face remained \n The pallid hues of hardly parted death. \n Amazement seized upon him, to the earth \n Brought back again: but from his lips tight drawn \n No murmur issued; he had power alone \n When questioned to reply. 'Speak,' quoth the hag, \n As I shall bid thee; great shall be thy gain \n If true thine answers, freed for evermore \n From all Haemonian art. Such burial place \n Shall now be thine, and on thy funeral pyre \n Such fatal woods shall burn, such chant shall sound, \n 'That to thy ghost no more or magic song \n Or spell shall reach, and thy Lethaean sleep \n Shall never more be broken in a death \n ' From me received anew: for such reward \n ' Think not this second life enforced in vain. \n ' Obscure may be the answers of the gods \n ' By priestess spoken at the holy shrine; \n ' But whoso braves the oracles of death \n ' In search of truth, should gain a sure response. \n ' Then speak, I pray thee. Let the hidden fates \n ' Tell through thy voice the mysteries to come.' \n Thus spake she, and her words by mystic force \n Gave him his answer; but with gloomy mien, \n And tears swift flowing, thus he made reply: \n 'Called from the margin of the silent stream \n I saw no fateful sisters spin the threads. \n 'Yet know I this, that 'mid the Roman shades \n 'Reigns fiercest discord; and this impious war \n 'Destroys the peace that ruled the fields of death. \n 'Elysian meads and deeps of Tartarus \n 'In paths diverse the Roman chieftains leave \n 'And thus disclose the fates. The blissful ghosts \n Bear visages of sorrow. Sire and son \n 'The Decii, who gave themselves to death \n 'In expiation of their country's doom, \n 'And great Camillus , wept; and Sulla's shade \n 'Complained of fortune. Scipio bewailed \n 'The scion of his race about to fall \n ' In sands of Libya : Cato , greatest foe \n ' To Carthage, grieves for that indignant soul \n ' Which shall disdain to serve. Brutus alone \n ' In all the happy ranks I smiling saw, \n ' First consul when the kings were thrust from Rome . \n ' The chains were fallen from boastful Catiline. \n ' Him too I saw rejoicing, and the pair \n ' Of Marii, and Cethegus' naked arm. \n \n ' The Drusi, heroes of the people, joyed, \n ' In laws immoderate; and the famous pair \n \n ' Of greatly daring brothers: guilty bands \n ' By bars eternal shut within the doors \n ' That close the prison of hell, applaud the fates, \n 'Claiming the plains Elysian: and the King \n ' Throws wide his pallid halls, makes hard the points \n ' Of craggy rocks, and forges iron chains, \n ' The victor's punishment. But take with thee \n 'This comfort, youth, that there a calm abode, \n ' And peaceful, waits thy father and his house. \n ' Nor let the glory of a little span \n ' Disturb thy boding heart: the hour shall come \n ' When all the chiefs shall meet. Shrink not from death, \n ' But glorying in the greatness of your souls, \n ' E'en from your humble sepulchres descend, \n ' And tread beneath your feet, in pride of place, \n ' The wandering phantoms of the gods of Rome . \n \n ' Which chieftain's tomb by Tiber shall be laved, \n ' And which by Nile ; their fate, and theirs alone, \n ' This battle shall decide. Nor seek to know \n ' From me thy fortunes: for the fates in time \n ' Shall give thee all thy due; and thy great sire, \n \n ' A surer prophet, in Sicilian fields \n 'Shall speak thy future-doubting even he \n ' What regions of the world thou shouldst avoid \n ' And what shouldst seek. O miserable race! \n ' Europe and Asia and Libya 's plains, \n \n ' Which saw your conquests, now shall hold alike \n ' Your burial-place-nor has the earth for you \n ' A happier land than this.' \n His task performed, \n He stands in mournful guise, with silent look \n Asking for death again; yet could not die \n Till mystic herb and magic chant prevailed. \n For nature's law, once used, had power no more \n To slay the corpse and set the spirit free. \n With plenteous wood she builds the funeral pyre \n To which the dead man comes: then as the flames \n Seized on his form outstretched, the youth and witch \n Together sought the camp; and as the dawn \n Now streaked the heavens, by the hag's command \n The day was stayed till Sextus reached his tent, \n And mist and darkness veiled his safe return.\n \n "

            "0":"\n NE'ER to the summons of the Eternal laws \n More slowly Titan rose, nor drave his steeds, \n Forced by the sky revolving, up the heaven, \n With gloomier presage; wishing to endure \n The pangs of ravished light, and dark eclipse; \n And drew the mists up, not to feed his flames, \n \n But lest his light upon Thessalian earth \n Might fall undimmed. \n Pompeius on that morn, \n To him the latest day of happy life, \n In troubled sleep an empty dream conceived. \n For in the watches of the night he heard \n Innumerable Romans shout his name \n Within his theatre; the benches vied \n To raise his fame and place him with the gods; \n As once in youth, when victory was won \n O'er conquered tribes whom swift Iberus girds, \n \n And when Sertorius' armies fought and fled, \n He sat triumphant for the west subdued, \n In pure white gown, and heard the Senate cheer; \n No less majestic as a Roman knight \n Than had the purple robe adorned his car. \n Perhaps, as ills drew near, his anxious soul, \n Shunning the future, wooed the happy past; \n Or, as is wont, prophetic slumber showed \n That which was not to be, by doubtful forms \n Misleading; or as envious Fate forbade \n Return to Italy , this glimpse of Rome \n \n Kind Fortune gave. Break not his latest sleep, \n Ye sentinels; let not the trumpet call \n Strike on his ear: for on the morrow's night \n Shapes of the battle lost, of death and war \n Shall crowd his rest with terrors. Whence shalt thou \n The poor man's happiness of sleep regain? \n Happy if thus, e'en thus, thy Rome could see \n Once more her captain! Would the gods had given \n To thee and to thy country one day yet \n To reap the latest fruit of such a love: \n Though sure of fate to come! Thou marchest on \n As though by heaven ordained in Rome to die; \n She, conscious ever of her prayers for thee \n Heard by the gods, deemed not the fates decreed \n Such evil destiny, that she should lose \n The last sad solace of her Magnus' tomb. \n Then young and old had blent their tears for thee, \n And child unbidden; women torn their hair \n And struck their bosoms as for Brutus dead. \n E'en now though trembling at the victor's sword, \n Though cruel Caesar herald thy defeat, \n Yet shall they grieve, while at the Thunderer's throne \n They offer incense and the laurel wreath. \n Ah, wretched fate! In silence must they groan; \n Nor in that theatre which heard thy praise \n Proclaim their sorrow for Pompeius dead. \n The stars had fled before the growing morn, \n When eager voices (as the fates drew on \n The world to ruin) round Pompeius' tent \n Ask for the signal. What! shall those condemned \n To die ere fall of eve, provoke the hour \n Of hastening death, demand the fatal doom \n Their own, their country's? 'Magnus fears,' they cry, \n He's patient of his kinsman, slow to strike, \n 'And fondly holds beneath his sway the world; \n 'So dreads a peace.' And kings from Orient lands, \n And peoples, eager for their distant homes, \n Already murmured at the lengthy war. \n Thus has it pleased the gods, when woe impends \n On guilty men, to make them seem its cause. \n We court disaster, crave the fatal sword. \n Of Magnus' camp Pharsalia was the prayer; \n For Tullius, of all the sons of Rome \n \n Chief orator, beneath whose civil rule \n Fierce Catiline at the peace-compelling axe \n Trembled and fled, arose, to Magnus' ear \n Bearing the voice of all. To him was war \n Grown hateful, and he longed once more to hear \n The Senate's plaudits; and with eloquent lips \n He lent persuasion to the weaker cause. \n Fortune, Pompeius, for her gifts to thee \n 'Asks this one boon, that thou shouldst use her now. \n Here at thy feet thy leading captains lie; \n ' And here thy monarchs, and a suppliant world \n ' Entreats thee prostrate for thy kinsman's fall. \n ' So long shall Caesar plunge the world in war? \n ' Swift was thy tread when these proud nations fell; \n ' How deep their shame, and justly, should delay \n 'Now mar thy conquests! Where thy trust in Fate, \n Thy fervour where? Ingrate! Dost dread the gods, \n ' Or think they favour not the Senate's cause? \n ' Thy troops unbidden shall the standards seize \n ' And conquer; thou in shame be forced to win. \n ' If at the Senate's orders and for us \n ' The war is waged, then give to us the right \n ' To choose the battle-field. Why dost thou keep \n ' From Caesar's throat the swords of all the world? \n ' The weapon quivers in the eager hand: \n ' Scarce one awaits the signal. Strike at once, \n ' Or without thee the trumpets sound the frav. \n ' Art thou the Senate's comrade or her lord? \n ' We wait your answer.' \n But Pompeius groaned; \n His mind was adverse, but he felt the fates \n Opposed his wish, and knew the hand divine.\n \n \n 'Since all desire it, and the fates prevail, \n ' So let it be; your leader now no more, \n ' I share the labours of the battle-field. \n ' Let Fortune roll the nations of the earth \n ' In one red ruin; myriads of mankind \n ' See their last sun to-day. Yet, Rome , I swear, \n ' This day of blood was forced upon thy son. \n ' Without a wound, the prizes of the war \n ' Might have been thine, and he who broke the peace \n ' In peace forgotten. Whence this lust for crime? \n ' Shall bloodless victories in civil war \n ' Be shunned, not sought? We've ravished from our foe \n All boundless seas, and land; his starving troops \n ' Have snatched earth's crop half-grown, in vain attempt \n ' Their hunger to appease; they prayed for death, \n ' Sought for the sword-thrust, and within our ranks \n ' Were fain to mix their life-blood with your own. \n ' Much of the war is done: the conscript youth \n ' Whose heart beats high, who burns to join the fray \n ' (Though men fight hard in terror of defeat), \n ' The shock of onset need no longer fear. \n ' Bravest is he who promptly meets the ill \n ' When fate commands it and the moment comes, \n Yet brooks delay, in prudence; and shall we, \n ' Our happy state enjoying, risk it all? \n ' Trust to the sword the fortunes of the world? \n ' Not victory, but battle, ye demand. \n ' Do thou, O Fortune, of the Roman state \n ' Who mad'st Pompeius guardian, from his hands \n ' Take back the charge grown weightier, and thyself \n ' Commit its safety to the chance of war. \n · Nor blame nor glory shall be mine to-day. \n 'Thy prayers unjustly, Caesar, have prevailed: \n ' We fight! What wickedness, what woes on men, \n ' Destruction on what realms this dawn shall bring! \n ' Crimson with Roman blood yon stream shall run. \n ' Would that (without the ruin of our cause) \n ' The first fell bolt hurled on this cursed day \n ' Might strike me lifeless! Victory to me \n ' Were not more joyful, for this battle brings \n ' A name of pity or a name of hate. \n ' The loser bears the burden of defeat; \n ' The victor wins, but conquest is a crime.' \n Thus to the soldiers, burning for the fray, \n He yields, forbidding, and throws down the reins. \n So may a sailor give the winds control \n Upon his barque, which, driven by the seas, \n Bears him an idle burden. Now the camp \n Hums with impatience, and the brave man's heart \n With beats tumultuous throbs against his breast; \n And all the host had standing in their looks \n The paleness of the death that was to come. \n \n On that day's fight 'twas manifest that Rome \n \n And all the future destinies of man \n Hung trembling; and by weightier dread possessed, \n They knew not danger. Who would fear for self \n Should ocean rise and whelm the mountain tops, \n And sun and sky descend upon the earth \n In universal chaos? Every mind \n Is bent upon Pompeius, and on Rome . \n They trust no sword until its deadly point \n Glows on the sharpening stone; no lance will serve \n Till straightened for the fray; each bow is strung \n Anew, and arrows chosen for their work \n Fill all the quivers; horsemen try the curb \n And fit the bridle rein and whet the spur. \n If toils divine with human may compare, \n 'Twas thus, when Phlegra bore the giant crew, \n \n In Etna 's furnace glowed the sword of Mars, \n Neptunus' trident felt the flame once more; \n And great Apollo after Python slain \n Sharpened his darts afresh: on Pallas' shield \n Was spread anew the dread Medusa's hair; \n And for the battle in Pallene 's fields \n The Cyclops forged new thunderbolts for Jove. \n Yet Fortune failed not, as they sought the field, \n In various presage of the ills to come; \n All heaven opposed their march: portentous fire \n In columns filled the plain, and torches blazed: \n And thirsty whirlwinds mixed with meteor bolts \n Smote on them as they strode, whose sulphurous flames \n Perplexed the vision. Crests were struck from helms; \n The melted sword-blade flowed upon the hilt: \n The spear ran liquid, and the hurtful steel \n Smoked with a sulphur that had come from heaven. \n Nay, more, the standards, hid by swarms of bees \n Innumerable, weighed the bearer down, \n Scarce lifted from the earth; bedewed with tears; \n No more of Rome the standards, or her state. \n And from the altar fled the frantic bull \n To fields afar; nor was a victim found \n To grace the sacrifice of coming doom. \n But thou, O Caesar, to what gods of ill \n Didst thou appeal? What furies didst thou call, \n What powers of madness and what Stygian Kings \n Whelmed in th' abyss of hell? Didst favour gain \n By sacrifice in this thine impious war? \n Strange sights were seen; or caused by hands divine \n Or due to fearful fancy. Haemus ' top \n Plunged headlong in the valley, Pindus met \n With high Olympus , while at Ossa's feet \n Red ran Boebeis, and Pharsalia's field \n Gave warlike voices as in depth of night. \n Now darkness came upon their wondering gaze, \n Now daylight pale and wan, their helmets wreathed \n In pallid mist; the spirits of their sires \n Hovered in air, and shades of kindred dead \n Passed flitting through the gloom. Yet had the host, \n Conscious of guilty prayers, and of the hope \n To do to death their brothers and their sires, \n One solace: that they found in hearts amazed \n With horrors, and in earth and air distraught, \n A happy omen of the crimes to come. \n Was't strange that peoples whom their latest day \n Of happy life awaited (if the mind \n Of man foreknows) should tremble with affright? \n Romans who dwelt by far Araxes' stream, \n And Tyrian Gades , in whatever clime, \n 'Neath every sky, struck by mysterious dread \n Were plunged in sorrow-yet rebuked the tear, \n For yet they knew not of the fatal day. \n Thus on Euganean hills where sulphurous fumes \n Disclose the rise of Aponus from earth, \n And where Timavus broadens in the meads, \n An augur spake: 'The last great day is come; \n ' To-day in battle meet the impious arms \n ' Of Caesar and of Magnus.' Or he saw \n The bolts of Jupiter , predicting ill; \n Or else the sky discordant o'er the space \n Of heaven, from pole to pole; or else perchance \n The sun was sad and misty in the height \n And told the battle by his wasted beams. \n By Nature's fiat that Thessalian day \n Passed not as others; if the gifted sense \n Of reading portents had been given to all, \n All men had known Pharsalia. Gods of heaven! \n How do ye mark the great ones of the earth! \n The world gives tokens of their weal or woe; \n The sky records their fates: in distant climes \n To future races shall their tale be told, \n Or by the fame alone of mighty deeds \n Had in remembrance, or by this my care \n Borne through the centuries: and men shall read \n In hope and fear the story of the war \n And breathless pray, as though it were to come, \n For that long since accomplished; and for thee \n E'en then, Pompeius, shall that prayer be given.\n \n \n Reflected from their arms, th' opposing sun \n Filled all the slope with radiance as they marched \n In ordered ranks to that ill-fated fight, \n And stood arranged for battle. On the left \n Thou, Lentulus, hadst charge; two legions there, \n The fourth, and bravest of them all, the first: \n While on the right, Domitius, ever stanch, \n Though fates be adverse, stood: in middle line \n The hardy soldiers from Cilician lands, \n In Scipio's care; their chief in Libyan days, \n To-day their comrade. By Enipeus' pools \n And by the rivulets, the mountain troops \n Of Cappadocia , and loose of rein \n Thy squadrons, Pontus : on the firmer ground \n \n Galatia 's tetrarchs and the greater kings; \n And all the purple-robed, the slaves of Rome . \n Numidian hordes were there from Afric shores, \n There Creta 's host and Ituraeans found \n Full space to wing their arrows; there the tribes \n From brave Iberia clashed their shields, and there \n \n Gaul stood arrayed against her ancient foe. \n Let all the nations be the victor's prize, \n None grace in future a triumphal car; \n This fight demands the slaughter of a world. \n Caesar that day to send his troops for spoil \n Had left his tent, when on the further hill \n Behold! his foe descending to the plain. \n The moment asked for by a thousand prayers \n Is come, which puts his fortune on the risk \n Of imminent war, to win or lose it all. \n For burning with desire of kingly power \n His eager soul ill brooked the small delay \n This civil war compelled: each instant lost \n Robbed from his due! But when at length he knew \n The last great conflict come, the fight supreme, \n Whose prize the leadership of all the world: \n And felt the ruin nodding to its fall: \n Swiftest to strike, yet for a little space \n His rage for battle failed; the spirit bold \n To pledge itself the issue, wavered now: \n For Magnus' fortunes gave no room for hope, \n Though Caesar's none for fear. Deep in his soul \n Such doubt was hidden, as to rouse the throng \n He spake of victory: ' Ye men of Rome \n \n ' Who made my fortunes, host that won the world! \n 'Prayed for so oft, the dawn of fight is come. \n 'No more entreat the gods: with sword in hand \n 'Seize on our fates; and Caesar in your deeds \n This day is great or little. This the day \n 'For which I hold since Rubicon was passed \n Your promise given: for this we flew to arms: \n \n 'For this deferred the triumphs which we won, \n 'And which the foe forbad : this gives you back \n ' Your homes and kindred, and the peaceful farm, \n ' Your prize for years of service in the field. \n ' And by the fates' command this day shall prove \n ' Whose quarrel juster: for defeat is guilt \n \n ' To him on whom it falls. If in my cause \n ' With fire and sword ye did your country wrong, \n ' Strike for acquittal! Should another judge \n ' This war, not Caesar, none were blameless found. \n ' Not for my sake this battle, but for you, \n ' To give you, soldiers, liberty and law \n 'Gainst all the world. Wishful myself for life \n ' Apart from public cares, and for the gown \n ' That robes the private citizen, I refuse \n ' To yield from office till the law allows \n ' Your right in all things. On my shoulders rest \n ' All blame; all power be yours. Nor deep the blood \n ' Between yourselves and conquest. Grecian schools \n ' Of exercise and wrestling send us here \n ' Their chosen darlings to await your swords; \n ' And scarcely armed for war, a dissonant crowd \n ' Barbaric, that will start to hear our trump, \n ' Nay, their own clamour. Not in civil strife \n ' Your blows shall fall-the battle of to-day \n ' Sweeps from the earth the enemies of Rome . \n ' Dash through these cowards and their vaunted kings: \n ' One stroke of sword and all the world is yours. \n ' Make plain to all men that the crowds who decked \n 'Pompeius' hundred pageants scarce were fit \n 'For one poor triumph. Shall Armenia care \n 'Who leads her masters, or barbarians shed \n 'One drop of blood to make Pompeius chief \n 'O'er our Italia ? Rome , 'tis Rome they hate, \n 'Their lord and master: yet they hate the most \n 'Those whom they know. My fate is in the hands \n 'Of you, mine own true soldiers, proved in all \n 'The wars we fought in Gallia . When the sword \n 'Of each of you shall strike, I know the hand: \n 'The javelin's flight to me betrays the arm \n 'That launched it hurtling: and to-day once more \n 'I see the faces stern, the threatening eyes, \n 'Unfailing proofs of victory to come. \n 'E'en now the battle rushes on my sight; \n 'Kings trodden down and scattered senators \n 'Fill all th' ensanguined plain, and peoples float \n 'Unnumbered on the crimson tide of death. \n 'Enough of words-I but delay the fates; \n 'And you who burn to dash into the fray, \n 'Forgive the pause. I tremble with the hope \n \n 'Thus finding utterance. I ne'er have seen \n 'The mighty gods so near; this little field \n 'Alone dividing us; their hands are full \n 'Of my predestined honours: for 'tis I \n 'Who when this war is done shall have the power \n 'O'er all that peoples, all that kings enjoy \n 'To shower it where I will. But has the sky \n 'Swerved from its course, has some high star of heaven \n 'Turned backwards, that such mighty deeds should pass \n 'Here on Thessalian earth? To-day we reap \n ' Of all our wars the harvest or the doom. \n ' Think of the cross that threats us, and the chain, \n ' Limbs hacked asunder, Caesar's head displayed \n ' Upon the rostra; and that narrow field \n ' Piled up with slaughter: for this hostile chief \n ' Is savage Sulla's pupil. 'Tis for you, \n ' If conquered, that I grieve: my lot apart \n ' Is cast long since. This sword, should one of you \n ' Turn from the battle ere the foe be fled, \n ' Shall rob the life of Caesar. O ye gods, \n ' Drawn down from heaven by the throes of Rome , \n ' May he be conqueror who shall not draw \n ' Against the vanquished an inhuman sword, \n ' Nor count it as a crime if men of Rome \n \n ' Preferred another's standard to his own. \n ' Pompeius' sword drank deep Italian blood \n 'When cabined in yon space the brave man's arm \n ' No more found room to strike. But you, I pray, \n ' Touch not the foe who turns him from the fight, \n ' A fellow citizen, a foe no more. \n ' But while the gleaming weapons threaten still, \n ' Let no fond memories unnerve the arm, \n \n ' No pious thought of father or of kin; \n ' But full in face of brother or of sire, \n ' Drive home the blade: of victims e'en unknown \n ' Your foes account the slaughter as a crime. \n ' Spare not our camp, but lay the rampart low \n ' And fill the fosse with ruin; not a man \n ' But holds his post within the ranks to-day. \n ' And yonder tents, deserted by the foe, \n ' Shall give us shelter when the rout is done.' \n Scarce had he paused; they snatch the hasty meal, \n And seize their armour and with swift acclaim \n Welcome the chief's predictions of the day, \n Tread low their camp when rushing to the fight; \n And take their post: nor word nor order given, \n In fate they put their trust. Nor, hadst thou placed \n All Caesars there, all striving for the throne \n Of Rome their city, had their serried ranks \n With speedier tread dashed down upon the foe.\n \n \n But when Pompeius saw the hostile troops \n Move forth in order and demand the fight, \n And knew the gods' approval of the day, \n He stood astonied, while a deadly chill \n Struck to his heart-omen itself of woe, \n That such a chief should at the call to arms, \n Thus dread the issue: but with fear repressed, \n Borne on his noble steed along the line \n Of all his forces, thus he spake: ' The day \n 'Your bravery demands, that final end \n Of civil war ye asked for, is at hand. \n Put forth your strength, your all; the sword to-day \n Does its last work. One crowded hour is charged \n With nations' destinies. Whoe'er of you \n Longs for his land and home, his wife and child, \n Seek them with sword. Here in mid battle-field, \n The gods place all at stake. Our better right \n Bids us expect their favour; they shall dip \n Your brands in Caesar's blood, and thus shall give \n Another sanction to the laws of Rome , \n Our cause of battle. If for him were meant \n An empire o'er the world, had they not put \n An end to Magnus' life? That I am chief \n Of all these mingled peoples and of Rome \n \n Disproves an angry heaven. See here combined \n 'All means of victory. Noble men have sought \n 'Unasked the risks of war. Our soldiers boast \n 'Ancestral statues. If to us were given \n 'A Curius, if Camillus were returned, \n Or patriot Decius to devote his life, \n 'Here would they take their stand. From furthest east \n 'All nations gathered, cities as the sand \n 'Unnumbered, give their aid: a world complete \n 'Serves 'neath our standards. North and south and all \n 'Who have their being 'neath the starry vault, \n 'Here meet in arms conjoined: and shall we not \n Crush with our closing wings this paltry foe? \n 'Few shall find room to strike; the rest with voice \n 'Must be content to aid: for Caesar's ranks \n 'Suffice not for us. Think from Rome 's high walls \n ' The matrons watch you with their hair unbound; \n ' Think that the Senate hoar, too old for arms, \n ' With snowy locks outspread; and Rome herself, \n ' The world's high mistress, fearing now, alas! \n ' A despot-all exhort you to the fight. \n ' Think that the people that is and that shall be \n 'Joins in the prayer-in freedom to be born, \n ' In freedom die, their wish. If 'mid these vows \n ' Be still found place for mine, with wife and child, \n ' So far as Imperator may, I bend \n ' Before you suppliant-unless this fight \n ' Be won, behold me exile, your disgrace, \n ' My kinsman's scorn. From this, 'tis yours to save. \n ' Then save! Nor in the latest stage of life, \n ' Let Magnus be a slave.' \n Then burned their souls \n At these his words, indignant at the thought, \n And Rome rose up within them, and to die \n Was welcome. \n Thus alike with hearts aflame \n Moved either host to battle, one in fear \n And one in hope of empire. These hands shall do \n Such work as not the rolling centuries, \n Not all mankind, though free from sword and war, \n Shall e'er make good. Nations that were to live \n This fight shall crush, and peoples pre-ordained \n To make the history of the coming world \n Shall come not to the birth. The Latin names \n Shall sound as fables in the ears of men, \n And ruins loaded with the dust of years \n Shall hardly mark her cities. Alba's hill, \n Home of our gods, no human foot shall tread, \n Save of some Senator at the nightly feast \n By Numa's orders founded-he compelled \n Serves his high office. Void and desolate \n Are Veii , Cora and Laurentum's hold; \n Yet not the tooth of envious time destroyed \n These storied monuments-'twas civil war \n That rased their citadels. Where now has fled \n The teeming life that once Italia knew? \n Not all the earth can furnish her with men: \n Untenanted her dwellings and her fields: \n Slaves till her soil: one city holds us all: \n Crumbling to ruin, the ancestral roof \n Finds none on whom to fall; and Rome herself, \n Void of her citizens, draws within her gates \n The dregs of all the world. That none might wage \n A civil war again, thus deeply drank \n Pharsalia's fight the life-blood of her sons. \n Dark in the calendar of Rome for aye, \n The days when Allia and Cannae fell: \n And shall Pharsalus ' morn, darkest of all, \n Stand on the page unmarked? Alas, the fates! \n Not plague nor pestilence nor famine's rage, \n Not cities given to the flames, nor towns \n Trembling at shock of earthquake shall weigh down \n Such heroes lost, when Fortune's ruthless hand \n Lops at one blow the gift of centuries, \n Leaders and men embattled. How great art thou, \n \n Rome , in thy fall! Stretched to the widest bounds \n War upon war laid nations at thy feet \n Till flaming Titan nigh to either pole \n Beheld thine empire; and the furthest east \n Was almost thine, till day and night and sky \n For thee revolved, and all the stars could see \n Throughout their course was Roman. But the fates \n In one dread day of slaughter and despair \n Turned back the centuries and spoke thy doom. \n And now the Indian fears the axe no more \n Once emblem of thy power, now no more \n The girded Consul curbs the Getan horde, \n Or in Sarmatian furrows guides the share: \n \n Still Parthia boasts her triumphs unavenged: \n Foul is the public life; and Freedom, fled \n To furthest Earth beyond the Tigris stream, \n And Rhine 's broad river, wandering at her will \n 'Mid Teuton hordes and Scythian, though by sword \n Sought, yet returns not. Would that from the day \n When Romulus, aided by the vulture's flight, \n Ill-omened, raised within that hateful grove \n \n Rome 's earliest walls, down to the crimsoned field \n In dire Thessalia fought, she ne'er had known \n \n Italia 's peoples! Did the Bruti strike \n In vain for liberty? Why laws and rights \n Sanctioned by all the annals designate \n With consular titles? Happier far the Medes \n And blest Arabia , and the Eastern lands \n Held by a kindlier fate in despot rule! \n That nation serves the worst which serves with shame. \n No guardian gods watch over us from heaven: \n Jove is no king; let ages whirl along \n In blind confusion: from his throne supreme \n Shall he behold such carnage and restrain \n His thunderbolts? On Mimas shall he hurl \n His fires, on Rhodope and OEta's woods \n Unmeriting such chastisement, and leave \n This life to Cassius' hand? On Argos fell \n At grim Thyestes' feast untimely night \n By him thus hastened; shall Thessalia 's land \n Receive full daylight, wielding kindred swords \n In fathers' hands and brothers'? Careless of men \n Are all the gods. Yet for this day of doom \n Such vengeance have we reaped as deities \n May give to mortals; for these wars shall raise \n Our parted Caesars to the gods; and Rome \n \n Shall deck their effigies with thunderbolts, \n And stars and rays, and in the very fanes \n Swear by the shades of men.\n \n \n With swift advance \n They seize the space that yet delays the fates \n Till short the span dividing. Then they gaze \n For one short moment where may fall the spear, \n What hand may deal their death, what monstrous task \n Soon shall be theirs; and all in arms they see, \n In reach of stroke, their brothers and their sires \n With front opposing; yet to yield their ground \n It pleased them not. But all the host was dumb \n With horror; cold upon each loving heart, \n Awe-struck, the life-blood pressed; and all men held \n With arms outstretched their javelins for a time, \n Poised yet unthrown. Now may th' avenging gods \n Allot thee, Crastinus, not such a death \n As all men else do suffer! In the tomb \n May'st thou have feeling and remembrance still! \n For thine the hand that first flung forth the dart, \n Which stained with Roman blood Thessalia 's earth. \n Madman! To speed thy lance when Caesar's self \n Still held his hand! Then from the clarions broke \n The strident summons, and the trumpets blared \n Responsive signal. Upward to the vault \n The sound re-echoes where nor clouds may reach \n Nor thunder penetrate; and Haemus ' slopes \n \n Reverberate to Pelion the din; \n Pindus re-echoes; OEta's lofty rocks \n Groan, and Pangaean cliffs, till at their rage \n Borne back from all the earth they shook for fear. \n Unnumbered darts they hurl, with prayers diverse; \n Some hope to wound: others, in secret, yearn \n For hands still innocent. Chance rules supreme, \n And wayward Fortune upon whom she wills \n Makes fall the guilt. Yet, for the hatred bred \n By civil war suffices spear nor lance, \n Urged on their flight afar: the hand must grip \n The sword and drive it to the foeman's heart. \n But while Pompeius' ranks, shield wedged to shield, \n Were ranged in dense array, and scarce had space \n To draw the blade, came rushing at the charge \n Full on the central column Caesar's host, \n Mad for the battle. Man nor arms could stay \n The crash of onset, and the furious sword \n Clove through the stubborn panoply to the flesh, \n There only stayed. One army struck-their foes \n Struck not in answer; Magnus' swords were cold, \n But Caesar's reeked with slaughter and with guilt. \n Nor Fortune lingered, but decreed the doom \n Which swept the ruins of a world away. \n Soon as withdrawn from all the spacious plain, \n Pompeius' horse was ranged upon the flanks; \n Passed through the outer files, the lighter armed \n Of all the nations joined the central strife, \n With divers weapons armed, but all for blood \n Of Rome athirst: then blazing torches flew, \n Arrows and stones, and ponderous balls of lead \n Molten by speed of passage through the air. \n There Ituraean archers and the Mede \n \n Winged forth their shafts unaimed, till all the sky \n Grew dark with missiles hurled; and from the night \n Brooding above, Death struck his victims down. \n Guiltless such blow, while all the crime was heaped \n Upon the Roman spear. In line oblique \n Behind the standards Caesar in reserve \n Had placed some companies of foot, in fear \n The foremost ranks might waver. These at his word, \n No trumpet sounding, break upon the ranks \n Of Magnus' horsemen where they rode at large \n Flanking the battle. They, unshamed of fear \n And careless of the fray, when first a steed \n Pierced through by javelin spurned with sounding hoof \n The temples of his rider, turned the rein, \n And through their comrades spurring from the field \n In panic, proved that not with warring Rome \n \n Barbarians may grapple. Then arose \n Immeasurable carnage: here the sword, \n There stood the victim, and the victor's arm \n Wearied of slaughter. Oh, that to thy plains, \n Pharsalia, might suffice the crimson stream \n From hosts barbarian, nor other blood \n Pollute thy fountains' sources! these alone \n Shall clothe thy pastures with the bones of men! \n Or if thy fields must run with Roman blood \n Then spare the nations who in times to come \n Must be her peoples! \n Now the terror spread \n Through all the army, and the favouring fates \n Decreed for Caesar's triumph: and the war \n Ceased in the wider plain, though still ablaze \n Where stood the chosen of Pompeius' force, \n Upholding yet the fight. Not here allies \n Begged from some distant king to wield the sword: \n Here were the Roman sons, the sires of Rome , \n Here the last frenzy and the last despair: \n Here, Caesar, was thy crime: and here shall stay \n My Muse repelled: no poesy of mine \n Shall tell the horrors of the final strife, \n Nor for the coming ages paint the deeds \n Which civil war permits. Be all obscured \n In deepest darkness! Spare the useless tear \n And vain lament, and let the deeds that fell \n In that last fight of Rome remain unsung.\n \n \n But Caesar adding fury to the breasts \n Already flaming with the rage of war, \n That each might bear his portion of the guilt \n Which stained the host, unflinching through the ranks \n Passed at his will. He looked upon the brands, \n These reddened only at the point, and those \n Streaming with blood and gory to the hilt: \n He marks the hand which trembling grasped the sword, \n Or held it idle, and the cheek that grew \n Pale at the blow, and that which at his words \n Glowed with the joy of battle: midst the dead \n He treads the plain and on each gaping wound \n Presses his hand to keep the life within. \n Thus Caesar passed: and where his footsteps fell \n As when Bellona shakes her crimson lash, \n Or Mavors scourges on the Thracian mares \n \n When shunning the dread face on Pallas' shield, \n He drives his chariot, there arose a night \n Dark with huge slaughter and with crime, and groans \n As of a voice immense, and sound of arms \n As fell the wearer, and of sword on sword \n Crashed into fragments. With a ready hand \n Caesar supplies the weapon and bids strike \n Full at the visage; and with lance reversed \n Urges the flagging ranks and stirs the fight. \n Where flows the nation's blood, where beats the heart, \n Knowing, he bids them spare the common herd, \n But seeks the senators-thus Rome he strikes, \n Thus the last hold of Freedom. In the fray, \n Then fell the nobles with their mighty names \n Of ancient prowess; there Metellus' sons, \n Corvini, Lepidi, Torquati too, \n Not once nor twice the conquerors of kings, \n First of all men, Pompeius' name except, \n Lay dead upon the field. \n But, Brutus, where, \n Where was thy sword? Veiled by a common helm \n Unknown thou wanderest. Thy country's pride, \n Hope of the Senate, thou (for none besides); \n Thou latest scion of that race of pride, \n Whose fearless deeds the centuries record, \n Tempt not the battle, nor provoke the doom! \n Awaits thee on Philippi 's fated field \n Thy Thessaly. Not here shalt thou prevail \n 'Gainst Caesar's life. Not yet hath he surpassed \n The height of power and deserved a death \n Noble at Brutus' hands-then let him live, \n Thy fated victim! \n There upon the field \n Lay all the honour of Rome ; no common stream \n Mixed with the purple tide. And yet of all \n Who noble fell, one only now I sing, \n Thee, brave Domitius. Whene'er the day \n Was adverse to the fortunes of thy chief \n Thine was the arm which vainly stayed the fight. \n Vanquished so oft by Caesar, now 'twas thine \n Yet free to perish. By a thousand wounds \n Came welcome death, nor had thy conqueror power \n Again to pardon. Caesar stood and saw \n The dark blood welling forth and death at hand, \n And thus in words of scorn: ' And dost thou lie, \n 'Domitius, there? And did Pompeius name \n 'Thee his successor, thee? Why leavest thou then \n His standards helpless?' But the parting life \n Still faintly throbbed within Domitius' breast, \n Thus finding utterance: 'Yet thou hast not won \n Thy hateful prize, for doubtful are the fates; \n 'Nor thou the master, Caesar; free as yet, \n 'With great Pompeius for my leader still, \n ' Warring no more, I seek the silent shades, \n Yet with this hope in death, that thou subdued \n 'To Magnus and to me in grievous guise \n 'Mayst pay atonement.' So he spake: no more; \n Then closed his eyes in death. \n 'Twere shame to shed, \n When thus a world was perishing, the tear \n Meet for each fate, or sing the wound that reft \n Each life away. One spurned upon the soil \n His vitals as they trailed; one faced the foe \n And as the sword struck deep into his throat \n Breathed forth his life: another fell to earth \n Prone at the stroke; one stood though shorn of limb; \n Glanced from this breast unharmed the quivering spear; \n That it transfixed to earth. Here from the veins \n Spouted the life-blood, till the foeman's arms \n Were crimsoned. One his brother slew, nor dared \n To spoil the corse, till severed from the neck \n He flung the head afar. Another dashed \n Full in his father's teeth the fatal sword, \n By murderous frenzy striving to disprove \n His kinship with the slain. Yet for each death \n We find no separate dirge, nor weep for men \n When peoples fell. Thus, Rome , thy doom was wrought \n At dread Pharsalus . Not, as in other fields, \n By soldiers slain, or captains; here were swept \n Whole nations to the death; Assyria here, \n \n Achaia , Pontus ; and the blood of Rome \n \n Gushing in torrents forth, forbade the rest \n To stagnate on the plain. Nor life was reft, \n Nor safety only then; but reeled the world \n And all her manifold peoples at the blow \n In that day's battle dealt; nor only then \n Felt, but in all the times that were to come. \n Those swords gave servitude to every age \n That shall be slavish; by our sires was shaped \n For us our destiny, the despot yoke. \n Yet have we trembled not, nor feared to bare \n Our throats to slaughter, nor to face the foe: \n We bear the penalty for others' shame, \n Such be our doom; yet, Fortune, sharing not \n In that last battle, 'twas our right to strike \n One blow for freedom ere we served our lord.\n \n \n Now saw Pompeius, grieving, that the gods \n Had left his side, and knew the fates of Rome \n \n Passed from his governance; yet all the blood \n That filled the field scarce brought him to confess \n His fortunes fled. A little hill he sought \n Whence to descry the battle raging still \n Upon the plain, which when he nearer stood \n The warring ranks concealed. Thence did the chief \n Gaze on unnumbered swords that flashed in air \n And sought his ruin; and the tide of blood \n In which his host had perished. Yet not as those \n Who, prostrate fallen, would drag nations down \n To share their evil fate, Pompeius did. \n Still were the gods thought worthy of his prayers \n To give him solace, in that after him \n Might live his Romans. 'Spare, ye gods,' he said, \n Nor lay whole peoples low; my fall attained, \n The world and Rome may stand. And if ye need \n More bloodshed, here on me, my wife, and sons \n 'Wreak out your vengeance-pledges to the fates \n Such have we given. Too little for the war \n Is our destruction? Doth the carnage fail, \n The world escaping? Magnus' fortunes lost, \n Why doom all else beside him? ' Thus he cried, \n And passed amid his standards, and recalled \n His vanquished host that rushed on fate declared. \n Not for his sake such carnage should be wrought. \n So thought Pompeius; nor the foeman's sword \n He feared, nor death; but lest upon his fall \n To quit their chief his soldiers might refuse, \n And o'er his prostrate corpse a world in arms \n Might find its ruin: or perchance he wished \n From Caesar's eager eyes to veil his death. \n In vain, unhappy! for the fates decree \n He shall behold, shorn from the bleeding trunk, \n Again thy visage. And thou, too, his spouse, \n Beloved Cornelia, didst cause his flight; \n Thy longed-for features; yet he shall not die \n When thou art present. \n \n Then upon his steed, \n Though fearing not the weapons at his back, \n Pompeius fled, his mighty soul prepared \n To meet his final doom. He saw thy field, \n \n Pharsalia , tearless and without a groan; \n For solemn grief and majesty of mien \n Were in his face, as for the woes of Rome . \n No pride in him the day of victory found, \n Nor rout shall find despair; alike in days \n When fickle Fortune triple triumph gave \n And when she fled, her lord. \n The burden laid \n Of thine impending fate, thou partest free \n To muse upon the happy days of yore. \n Hope now has fled; but in the fleeting past \n How wast thou great! Seek thou the wars no more, \n And call the gods to witness that for thee \n Henceforth no man shall die. The fights to come \n On Afric's mournful shore, by Pharos' stream \n And fateful Munda , and the final scene \n Of dire Pharsalia 's battle are not thine. \n Thy name no more shall stir the world to war, \n But those great rivals biding with us yet, \n Caesar and Liberty; and not for thee \n When thou hadst fled the field, but for itself \n The dying Senate still upheld the fight. \n Find'st thou not solace thus to quit the field \n Nor witness all the horrors of its close? \n Look back upon the crimsoned ranks of war, \n The rivers turbid with ensanguined stream; \n Then pity thou thy kinsman. How shall he \n Enter the city, who on such a field \n Finds happiness? Whate'er in lands unknown \n Thine exiled lot, whate'er the Pharian king \n May place upon thee, trust thou in the gods; \n Trust the long story of the favouring fates: \n 'Twere worse to conquer. Then forbid the tear, \n The nation's grief, the weeping of mankind, \n And let the world adore thee in defeat \n As in thy triumphs. With unaltered gaze \n Look down upon the kings, thy subjects still; \n Look on the realms and cities which they hold, \n \n Egypt and Libya , gifts from thee of yore; \n And choose the country that befits thy death. \n Larissa first was witness of thy fall, \n Thy noble mien, as victor of the fates; \n And loud in sorrow, yet with gifts of price \n Fit for a conqueror flung back her gates \n And poured her citizens forth. ' Our homes and fanes \n To thee are open; would it were our lot \n With thee to perish; of thy mighty name \n Still much survives and conquered by thyself, \n Thyself alone, still couldst thou to the war \n All nations call and challenge fate again.' \n But thus he spake: 'To cities nor to men \n Avails the conquered aught: then pledge your faith \n To him who has the victory.' Caesar still \n Trod deep in piles of slaughter on the field, \n His country's vitals, while his daughter's spouse \n Thus gave him kingdoms. But Pompeius fled \n 'Mid sobs and groans and blaming of the gods \n For this their fierce commandment; and he fled \n Full of the fruits and knowledge of the love \n The peoples bore him, which he knew not his \n In times of happiness.\n \n \n When Italian blood \n Flowed deep enough upon the fatal field, \n Caesar gave mercy to the meaner crowd \n Whose deaths were vain. But that the hostile camp \n Might not recall the foe, nor calm of night \n Banish their fears, he bids his cohorts dash, \n While Fortune glowed and terror filled the plain, \n Straight on the ramparts of the conquered foe. \n Light was the task to urge them to the spoil \n Though worn by battle, wearied with the fray: \n Soldiers,' he said, ' the victory is ours, \n Full and triumphant: there doth lie the prize \n Which you have won, not Caesar; at your feet \n Behold the booty of the hostile camp. \n Snatched from Hesperian nations ruddy gold, \n And all the riches of the Orient world, \n Are piled within the tents. The wealth of kings \n And of Pompeius here awaits its lords. \n Haste, soldiers, and outstrip the flying foe; \n E'en now the vanquished of Pharsalia 's field \n Anticipate your spoils.' No more he said, \n But drave them, blind with frenzy for the gold, \n To spurn the bodies of their fallen sires, \n And trample chiefs in dashing on their prey. \n What rampart had restrained them as they rushed \n To seize the prize for wickedness and war \n And learn the price of guilt? And though they found \n In ponderous masses heaped for need of war \n The trophies of a world, yet were their minds \n Unsatisfied, that asked for all. Whate'er \n Iberian mines or Tagus bring to day, \n Or Arimaspians from golden sands \n May gather, had they seized; still they had thought \n Their guilt too cheaply sold. When pledged to them \n Was the Tarpeian rock, for victory won, \n And all the spoils of Rome , by Caesar's word, \n Shall camps suffice them? Then plebeian limbs \n On senators' turf took rest, on kingly couch \n The soldier wretch; and there the murderer lay \n Where yesternight his brother or his sire. \n In maddened dreams the fury of the fight \n Still raged, and in their sleep the guilty hand \n Still wrought its deed, of blood, and restless gripped \n The phantom sword-hilt. Thou hadst said that groans \n Issued from all the plain, that parted souls \n Had breathed a life into the guilty soil, \n That earthly darkness teemed with gibbering ghosts \n And Stygian terrors. Victory foully won \n Thus claimed its punishment. The slumbering sense \n Already heard the hiss of vengeful flames: \n There troop the ghostly slain: a slaughtered sire \n Tortures the breast of one; a brother's shape \n There haunts his murderer's couch: each sees the form \n Of him whose life he took. But all the dead \n In Caesar's dreams were visioned. In such guise \n Orestes saw the Furies, ere he fled \n To purge his sin within the Scythian bounds; \n Such fierce convulsions raged within the soul \n Of Pentheus mad; and in Agave's mind \n When she had known her son. Before his gaze \n Flashed all the javelins which Pharsalia saw, \n Or that avenging day when drew their blades \n The Roman senators; and monstrous shapes \n Scourged all his frame. 'Tis thus the wretch shall find \n In guilty conscience punishment most dire: \n He saw the Styx before his rival died: \n And goblin horrors from the depths of Hell \n Thronged on his sleep. \n Yet when the radiant sun \n Unveiled the butchery of Pharsalia 's field \n \n He shrank not from its horror, nor withdrew \n His feasting gaze. There rolled the streams in flood \n With crimson carnage; there a seething heap \n Rose shrouding all the plain, now in decay \n Slow settling down; there numbered he the host \n Of Magnus slain; and for the morn's repast \n That spot he chose whence he might watch the dead, \n And feast his eyes upon Emathia 's field \n Concealed by corpses; of the bloody sight \n Insatiate, he forbad the funeral pyre, \n And cast Emathia in the face of heaven. \n Nor by the Punic victor was he taught, \n Who at the close of Cannae 's fatal fight \n Laid in the earth the Roman consul dead, \n To find fit burial for his fallen foes; \n For these were all his countrymen, nor yet \n His ire by blood appeased. Yet ask we not \n For separate pyres or sepulchres apart \n Wherein to lay the ashes of the fallen: \n Burn in one holocaust the nations slain; \n Or should it please thy soul to torture more \n Thy kinsman, pile on high from OEta's slopes \n And Pindus' top the woods: thus shall he see \n While fugitive on the deep the blaze that marks \n Thessalian bounds. Yet by this idle rage \n Nought dost thou profit; for these corporal frames \n Bearing innate from birth the certain germs \n Of dissolution, whether by decay \n Or fire consumed, shall fall into the lap \n Of all-embracing nature. Thus if now \n Thou shouldst deny the pyre, still in that flame \n When all shall crumble, earth and rolling seas \n And stars commingled with the bones of men, \n These too shall perish. Where thy soul shall go \n These shall companion thee; no higher flight \n In airy realms is thine, nor smoother couch \n Beneath the Stygian darkness; for the dead \n No fortune favours, and our Mother Earth \n \n All that is born from her receives again, \n And he whose bones no tomb or urn protects \n \n Yet sleeps beneath the canopy of heaven. \n And thou, proud conqueror, who wouldst deny \n The rites of burial to thousands slain, \n Why flee thy field of triumph? Why desert \n This reeking plain? Drink, Caesar, if thou canst \n Of these ensanguined streams, and breathe the air \n Of cursed Thessalia : but from thy grasp \n The earth is ravished, and th' unburied host, \n Routing their victor, hold Pharsalia's field. \n Then to the ghastly harvest of the war \n Came all the beasts of earth whose facile sense \n Of odour tracks the bodies of the slain. \n Sped from his northern home the Thracian wolf; \n Bears left their dens and lions from afar \n Scenting the carnage; dogs obscene and foul \n Their homes deserted: all the air was full \n Of gathering fowl, who in their flight had long \n Pursued the armies. Cranes who yearly change \n The frosts of Thracia for the banks of Nile , \n This year delayed their voyage. As ne'er before \n The air grew dark with vultures' hovering wings, \n Innumerable, for every grove and wood \n Sent forth its denizens; on every tree \n Dripped from their crimsoned beaks a gory dew. \n Oft on the conquerors and their impious arms \n Or purple rain of blood, or mouldering flesh \n Fell from the lofty heaven; or limbs of men \n From weary talons dropped. Yet even so \n The peoples passed not all into the maw \n Of ravening beast or fowl; the inmost flesh \n Scarce did they touch, nor limbs-thus lay the dead \n Scorned by the spoiler; and the Roman host \n By sun and length of days, and rain from heaven, \n At length was mingled with Emathia 's plain. \n Ill-starred Thessalia ! By what hateful crime \n Didst thou offend that thus on thee alone \n Was laid such carnage? By what length of years \n Shalt thou be cleansed from the curse of war? \n When shall the harvest of thy fields arise \n Free from their purple stain? And when the share \n Cease to upturn the slaughtered hosts of Rome ? \n First shall the battle onset sound again, \n Again shall flow upon thy fated earth \n A crimson torrent. Thus may be o'erthrown \n Our sires' memorials; those erected last, \n Or those which pierced by ancient roots have spread \n Through broken stones their sacred urns abroad. \n Thus shall the ploughman of Haemonia gaze \n On more abundant ashes, and the rake \n Pass o'er more frequent bones. Wert, Thracia , thou, \n Our only battlefield, no sailor's hand \n Upon thy shore should make his cable fast; \n No spade should turn, the husbandman should flee \n Thy fields, the resting-place of Roman dead; \n No lowing kine should graze, nor shepherd dare \n To leave his fleecy charge to browse at will \n On fields made fertile by our mouldering dust; \n All bare and unexplored thy soil should lie, \n As past man's footsteps, parched by cruel suns, \n Or palled by snows unmelting! But, ye gods, \n Give us to hate the lands which bear the guilt; \n Let not all earth be cursed, though not all \n Be blameless found. \n 'Twas thus that Munda's fight \n And blood of Mutina , and Leucas ' cape, \n And sad Pachynus, made Philippi pure.\n \n "

            "0":"\n Now through Alcides' pass and Tempe 's groves \n Pompeius, aiming for Haemonian glens \n And forests lone, urged on his wearied steed \n Scarce heeding now the spur; by devious tracks \n Seeking to veil the footsteps of his flight: \n The rustle of the foliage, and the noise \n Of following comrades filled his anxious soul \n With terrors, as he fancied at his side \n Some ambushed enemy. Fallen from the height \n Of former fortunes, still the chieftain knew \n His life not worthless; mindful of the fates: \n And 'gainst the price he set on Caesar's head, \n He measures Caesar's value of his own. \n Yet, as he rode, the features of the chief \n Made known his ruin. Many as they sought \n The camp Pharsalian, ere yet was spread \n News of the battle, met the chief, amazed, \n And wondered at the whirl of human things: \n Nor held disaster sure, though Magnus' self \n Told of his ruin. Every witness seen \n Brought peril on his flight: 'twere better far \n Safe in a name obscure, through all the world \n To wander; but his ancient fame forbad. \n Too long had great Pompeius from the height \n Of human glory, envied of mankind, \n Looked on all others; nor for him henceforth \n Could life be lowly. The honours of his youth \n Too early thrust upon him, and the deeds \n Which brought him triumph in the Sullan days, \n His conquering navy and the Pontic war, \n Made heavier now the burden of defeat, \n And crushed his pondering soul. So length of days \n Drags down the haughty spirit, and life prolonged \n When power has fled. Unless when honour fails \n Comes end of life, and timely death forestalls \n Ensuing woe, the glory of past years \n Is present shame. Who'd venture on the sea \n Of favouring fortune but for death at need? \n Hard by Peneus' flood he reached the main \n Now with Pharsalus ' slaughter blushing red: \n And borne in sloop, to shallows of a stream \n Scarce equal, dared the deep: Liburnia's lord, \n Lord of Cilicia , at whose countless oars \n Yet Leucas ' inlets and Corcyra shook, \n Crept to the shelter of a tiny bark. \n For thou didst beckon him to Lesbos ' shores, \n Thou, partner of the sorrows of thy lord, \n Cornelia! Sadder far thy life apart \n Than wert thou present in Thessalia 's fields. \n Racked is thy heart with presages of ill; \n Pharsalia fills thy dreams and when the shades \n Give place to dawn, with hasty step thou tread'st \n Some cliff sea-beaten, and with gaze intent \n To mark the sail of each approaching ship \n Art first: yet dar'st not ask thy husband's fate. \n Lo! the ship comes, her load of ills unknown, \n Thy worst of fears some messenger of woe, \n Some evil tidings of the battle day: \n Nay! it is he, thy husband in defeat: \n Fear then no more, but weep; nor waste the hour. \n He leaps to land; she marks the cruel doom \n Wrought by the gods upon him: pale and wan \n His weary features, by the hoary locks \n Shaded; the dust of travel on his garb. \n Dark on her soul a night of anguish fell; \n Her trembling limbs no longer bore her frame: \n Scarce throbbed her heart, and prone on earth she lay \n Deceived in hope of death. The boat made fast, \n Pompeius treading the lone waste of sand \n Drew near; whom when Cornelia's maidens saw, \n They stayed their weeping, yet with sighs subdued, \n Reproached the fates; and tried in vain to raise \n Their mistress' form, till Magnus to his breast \n Drew her with cherishing arms; and at the touch \n Of soothing hands the life-blood to her veins \n Returned once more, and she could bear to look \n Upon his features. He forbad despair, \n Chiding her grief. ' Not at the earliest blow \n By Fortune dealt, inheritress of fame \n Bequeathed by noble fathers, should thy strength \n Thus fail and yield: renown shall yet be thine, \n To last through ages; not of laws decreed \n Nor conquests won; a gentler path to thee \n As to thy sex, is given; thy husband's woe. \n Let thine affection struggle with the fates, \n And in his misery love thy lord the more. \n I bring thee greater glory, for that gone \n Is all the pomp of lictors, gone the crowd \n Of faithful senators, and the band of kings; \n Now first Pompeius for himself alone \n 'Tis thine to love. Curb this unbounded grief, \n ' While yet I breathe, unseemly. O'er my tomb \n ' Weep out thy full, the final pledge of faith. \n ' Thou hast no loss, nor has the war destroyed \n ' Aught save my fortune. If for that thy grief, \n ' That was thy love.' \n Roused by her husband's words, \n Yet scarcely could she raise her trembling limbs, \n Thus speaking through her sobs: ' Would I had sought \n ' Detested Caesar's couch, ill-omened wife \n ' Of spouse unhappy; at my nuptials twice \n ' A Fury has been bridesmaid; and the ghosts \n ' Of slaughtered Crassi, with avenging shades \n ' Brought by my wedlock to thy doomed camp \n ' A Parthian massacre. Twice my star has cursed \n ' The world, and peoples have been hurled to death \n ' In one red moment; and the gods through me \n ' Have left the better cause. 0, hero mine, \n ' O mightiest husband, wedded to a wife \n ' Unworthy! 'Twas through her that Fortune gained \n 'The right to strike thee. Wherefore did I wed \n ' To bring thee misery? Mine, mine the guilt, \n ' Mine be the penalty. And that the wave \n ' May bear thee gently onwards, and the kings \n 'May keep their faith to thee, and all the earth \n ' Be ready to thy rule, me from thy side \n ' Cast to the billows. Rather had I died \n ' To bring thee victory; thy disasters thus, \n Thus expiate. And, cruel Julia, thee, \n ' Who by this war hast vengeance on our vows, \n ' From thine abode I call: atonement find \n ' In this thy rival's death, and spare at least \n ' Thy Magnus.' Then upon his breast she fell, \n While all the concourse wept-e'en Magnus' self, \n Who saw Thessalia 's field without a tear.\n \n \n But now upon the shore a numerous band \n From Mitylene thus approached the chief: \n 'If 'tis our greatest glory to have kept \n ' The pledge with us by such a husband placed, \n ' Do thou one night within these friendly walls \n ' We pray thee, stay; thus honouring the homes \n ' Long since devoted, Magnus, to thy cause. \n This spot in days to come the guest from Rome \n \n ' For thee shall honour. Nowhere shalt thou find \n ' A surer refuge in defeat. All else \n ' May court the victor's favour; we long since \n ' Have earned his chastisement. And though our isle \n ' Rides on the deep, girt by the ocean wave, \n ' No ships has Caesar: and to us shall come, \n ' Be sure, thy captains, to our trusted shore, \n ' The war renewing. Take, for all is thine, \n ' The treasures of our temples and the gold, \n ' Take all our youth by land or on the sea \n ' To do thy bidding: Lesbos only asks \n ' This from the chief who sought her in his pride, \n ' Not in his fall to leave her.' Pleased in soul \n At such a love, and joyed that in the world \n Some faith still lingered, thus Pompeius said: \n Earth has for me no dearer land than this. \n ' Did I not trust it with so sweet a pledge \n ' And find it faithful? Here was Rome for me, \n ' Country and household gods. This shore I sought \n ' Home of my wife, this Lesbos , which for her \n ' Had merited remorseless Caesar's ire: \n ' Nor was afraid to trust you with the means \n ' To gain his mercy. But enough-through me \n 'Your guilt was caused-I part, throughout the world \n 'To prove my fate. Farewell thou happiest land! \n 'Famous for ever, whether taught by thee \n ' Some other kings and peoples may be pleased \n ' To give me shelter; or shouldst thou alone \n Be faithful. And now seek I in what lands \n ' Right may be found or wrong. My latest prayer \n 'Receive, 0 deity, if still with me \n 'Thou bidest, thus. May it be mine again, \n Conquered, with hostile Caesar on my track, \n 'To find a Lesbos where to enter in \n 'And whence to part, unhindered.' \n In the boat \n He placed his spouse: while from the shore arose \n Such lamentation, and such hands were raised \n In ire against the gods, that thou hadst deemed \n All left their kin for exile, and their homes. \n And though for Magnus grieving in his fall \n Yet for Cornelia chiefly did they mourn \n Long since their gentle guest. For her had wept \n The Lesbian matrons had she left to join \n A victor husband: for she won their love, \n By kindly modesty and gracious mien, \n Ere yet her lord was conquered, while as yet \n Their fortunes stood. Now slowly to the deep \n Sank fiery Titan; but not yet to those \n He sought (if such there be) was shown his orb, \n Though veiled from those he quitted. Magnus' mind, \n Anxious with waking cares, sought through the kings \n His subjects, and the cities leagued with Rome \n \n In faith, and through the pathless tracts that lie \n Beyond the scorching suns of southern climes: \n Till trouble of his cares and hateful thought \n Of that which might be, made him cast afar \n His wavering doubts, and from the captain seek \n Some counsel on the heavens; how by the sky \n He marked his track upon the deep; what star \n Guided the path to Syria , and what points \n Found in the Wain would pilot him aright \n To shores of Libya . But thus replied \n The well-skilled watcher of the silent skies: \n 'Not by the constellations moving ever \n 'Across the heavens do we guide our barks; \n 'For that were perilous; but by that star \n \n 'Which never sinks nor dips below the wave, \n 'Girt by the glittering groups men call the Bears. \n 'When stands the pole-star clear before the mast, \n 'Then to the Bosphorus look we, and the main \n 'Which carves the coast of Scythia . But the more \n 'Bootes dips, and nearer to the sea \n 'Is Cynosura seen, so much the ship \n ' Towards Syria tends, till bright Canopus \n shines, \n 'In southern skies content to hold his course; \n ' With him upon the left past Pharos borne \n 'Straight for the Syrtes shalt thou plough the deep. \n ' But whither now dost bid me shape the yards \n 'And set the canvas? ' \n Magnus, doubting still; \n 'This only be thy care: from Thracia steer \n ' The vessel onward; shun with all thy skill \n ' Italia 's distant shore: and for the rest \n 'Trust to the winds for guidance. When I sought, \n ' Pledged with the Lesbians, my spouse beloved, \n 'My course was sure: now, Fortune, where thou wilt \n Give me a refuge.' These his answering words. \n The pilot, as they hung from level yards \n Shifted the sails; and hauling to the stern \n One sheet, he slacked the other, to the left \n Steering, where Samian rocks and Chian marred \n The stillness of the waters; while the sea \n Sent up in answer to the changing keel \n A different murmur. Not so deftly turns \n Curbing his steeds, his wain the Charioteer, \n While glows his dexter wheel, and with the left \n He almost touches, yet avoids the goal. \n Now Titan veiled the stars and showed the shore; \n When, following Magnus, came a scattered band \n Saved from the Thracian storm. From Lesbos ' port \n His son; next, captains who preserved their faith; \n . For at his side, though vanquished in the field, \n Cast down by fate, in exile, still there stood, \n Lords of the earth and all her Orient realms, \n The Kings, his ministers. To the furthest lands \n He bids Deiotarus: ' O faithful friend,\n \n \n 'Since in Emathia 's battle-field was lost \n 'The world, so far as Roman, it remains \n ' To test the faith of peoples of the East \n ' Who drink of Tigris and Euphrates ' stream, \n 'Secure as yet from Caesar. Be it thine \n 'Far as the rising of the sun to trace \n ' The fates that favour Magnus: to the courts \n ' Of Median palaces, to Scythian steppes; \n 'And to the son of haughty Arsaces, \n 'To bear my message, \"Hold ye to the faith, \n '\" Pledged by your priests and by the Thunderer's name \n ' \"Of Latium sworn? Then fill your quivers full, \n ' \"Draw to its fullest span th' Armenian bow; \n '\" And, Getan archers, wing the fatal shaft. \n '\" And you, ye Parthians, if when I sought \n '\"The Caspian gates, and on th' Alaunian tribes \n \" Fierce, ever-warring, pressed, I suffered you \n \" In Persian tracts to wander, nor compelled \n \" To seek for shelter Babylonian walls; \n \" If beyond Cyrus' kingdom and the bounds \n \" Of wide Chaldaea, where from Nysa 's top \n '\"Pours down Hydaspes , and the Ganges stream \n ' Foams to the ocean, nearer far I stood \n '\" Than Persia's bounds to Phoebus' rising fires; \n '\" If by my sufferance, Parthians, you alone \n '\" Decked not my triumphs, but in equal state \n \" Sole of all Eastern princes, face to face \n \" Met Magnus in his pride, nor only once \n ' Through me were saved; (for after that dread day \n \" Who but Pompeius soothed the kindling fires \n \" Of Latium's anger?) - by my service paid \n '\"Come forth to victory : burst the ancient bounds \n ' By Macedon's hero set: in Magnus' cause \n \" March, Parthians, to Rome 's conquest. Rome herself \n ' Prays to be conquered.\"' \n Hard the task imposed; \n Yet doffed his robe, and swift obeyed, the king \n Wrapped in a servant's mantle. If a Prince \n For safety play the boor, then happier, sure, \n The peasant's lot than lordship of the world. \n The king thus parted, past Icaria 's rocks \n Pompeius' vessel skirts the foamy crags \n Of little Samos : Colophon 's tranquil sea \n And Ephesus lay behind him, and the air \n Breathed freely on him from the Coan shore. \n \n Cnidos he shunned, and, famous for its sun, \n \n Rhodos , and steering for the middle deep \n Escaped the windings of Telmessus' bay; \n Till rose Pamphylian coasts before the bark, \n And first the fallen chieftain dared to find \n In small Phaselis shelter; for therein \n Scarce was the husbandman, and empty homes \n Forbad to fear. Next Taurus' heights he saw \n And Dipsus falling from his lofty sides: \n So sailed he onward. \n Did Pompeius dream, \n When giving safety to the seas, he made \n Flight for himself secure? His little boat \n Flies unmolested past Cilician shores; \n But to their exiled lord in chiefest part \n The senate of Rome was drawn. Celendrae there \n Received their fleet, where fair Selinus ' stream \n In spacious bay gives refuge from the main; \n And to the gathered chiefs in mournful words \n At length Pompeius thus resolved his thoughts : \n O faithful comrades mine in war and flight! \n To me, my country! Though this barren shore \n Our place of meeting, and no gathered host \n 'Surrounds us, yet upon our changed estate \n I seek your counsel. Rouse ye as of yore \n With hearts of courage! Magnus on the field \n 'Not all is perished, nor do fates forbid \n But that I rise afresh with living hope \n Of future victories, and spurn defeat. \n 'From Libyan ruins did not Marius rise \n 'Again recorded Consul on the page \n Full of his honours? shall a lighter blow \n 'Keep Magnus down, whose thousand chiefs and ships \n 'Still plough the billows; by defeat his strength \n 'Not whelmed but scattered? And the fame alone \n ' Of our great deeds of glory in the past \n ' Shall now protect us, and the world unchanged \n 'Still love its hero. Weigh upon the scales \n Ye chiefs, which best may help the needs of Rome , \n 'In faith and armies; or the Parthian realm \n ' Egypt or Libya . For myself, I keep \n 'No secret thoughts apart, but thus advise. \n 'Place no reliance on the Pharian king: \n 'Faith, to be constant, needs a riper age; \n 'Nor on th' unstable cunning of the Moor, \n Who vain of Punic blood, and of descent \n \n 'Supposed from Hannibal, is swollen with pride \n 'At Varus' prayer for aid, and sees in thought \n \n Rome 's fates beneath his own. Then, comrades, seek \n 'At speed, the Eastern world. Those mighty realms \n ' Euphrates severs from us, and the gates \n 'Called Caspian; on another sky than ours \n ' There day and night revolve; another sea \n ' Of different hue is parted from our own. \n \n ' Rule is their wish, nought else: and in their plains \n ' Taller the war-horse, stronger twangs the bow; \n ' There fails nor youth nor age to wing the shaft \n ' Fatal in flight. Their archers first subdued \n ' The lance of Macedon and Bactra 's walls, \n ' Home of the Mede; and haughty Babylon \n \n ' With all her storied towers: nor shall they dread \n ' The Roman onset; trusting to the shafts \n ' By which the host of fated Crassus fell. \n ' Nor trust they only to the javelin blade \n ' Untipped with poison: from the rancorous edge \n 'The slightest wound deals death. Would that my lot \n ' Forced me not thus to trust that savage race \n ' Of Arsaces! Yet now their emulous fate \n ' Contends with Roman destinies: the gods \n ' Smile favouring on their nation. Thence I'll pour \n ' On Caesar peoples from another earth \n ' And all the Orient ravished from its home. \n ' But should the East and barbarous treaties fail, \n ' Fate, bear our shipwrecked fortunes past the bounds \n ' Of earth, as known to men. The kings I made \n ' I supplicate not, but in death shall take \n ' To other spheres this solace, chief of all; \n ' His hands, my kinsman's, never shed my blood \n ' Nor soothed me dying. Yet as my mind in turn \n ' The varying fortunes of my life recalls, \n ' How was I glorious in that Eastern world! \n ' How great my name by far Maeotis marsh \n ' And where swift Tanais flows! No other land \n 'Has so resounded with my conquests won, \n ' So sent me home triumphant. Rome , do thou \n ' Approve my enterprise! What happier chance \n ' Could favouring gods afford thee? Parthian hosts \n ' Shall fight the civil wars of Rome , and share \n ' Her ills, and fall enfeebled. When the arms \n ' Of Caesar meet with Parthian in the fray, \n ' Then must kind Fortune vindicate my lot \n 'Or Crassus be avenged.' But murmurs rose, \n And Magnus speaking knew his words condemned. \n Then Lentulus answered, with indignant soul, \n Foremost to rouse their valour, thus in words \n Worthy a Consul:\n \n \n 'Have Thessalian woes \n ' Broken thy spirit so? One day's defeat \n ' Condemned the world to ruin? Is the cause \n ' Lost in one battle and beyond recall? \n ' Find we no cure for wounds? Does Fortune drive \n ' Thee, Magnus, to the Parthians' feet alone? \n ' And dost thou, fugitive, spurn the lands and skies \n ' Known heretofore, and seek for other poles \n ' And constellations, and Chaldean gods, \n ' And rites barbarian, servant of the realm \n ' Of Parthia? But why then took we arms \n ' For love of liberty? If thou canst slave \n ' Thou hast deceived the world! Shall Parthia see \n ' Thee at whose name, ruler of mighty Rome , \n ' She trembled, at whose feet she captive saw \n ' Hyrcanian kings and Indian princes kneel, \n ' Now humbly suppliant, victim of the fates; \n ' And at thy prayer her puny strength extol \n ' In mad contention with the Western world? \n ' Nor think, Pompeius, thou shalt plead thy cause \n ' In that proud tongue unknown to Parthian ears \n ' Of which thy fame is worthy; sobs and tears \n ' He shall demand of thee. And has our shame \n ' Brought us to this, that some barbarian foe \n ' Shall venge Hesperia's wrongs ere Rome her own? \n ' Thou wert our leader for the civil war: \n ' Mid Scythia's peoples dost thou bruit abroad \n ' Wounds and disasters which are ours alone? \n ' Rome until now, though subject to the yoke \n ' Of civic despots, yet within her walls \n ' Has brooked no foreign lord. And art thou pleased \n ' From all the world to summon to her gates \n ' These savage peoples, while the standards lost \n ' By far Euphrates when the Crassi fell \n ' Shall lead thy columns? Shall the only king \n ' Who failed Emathia , while the fates yet hid \n 'Their favouring voices, brave the victor's power, \n ' And join with thine his fortune? Nay, not so \n 'This nation trusts itself. Each race that claims \n ' A northern birth, unconquered in the fray \n ' Claims but the warrior's death; but as the sky \n ' Slopes towards the eastern tracts and gentler climes \n ' So are the nations. There in flowing robes \n ' And garments delicate are men arrayed. \n 'True that the Parthian in Sarmatia 's plains, \n ' Where Tigris spreads across the level meads, \n ' Contends invincible; for flight is his \n ' Unbounded; but should uplands bar his path \n ' He scales them not; nor through the night of war \n ' Shall his weak bow uncertain in its aim \n ' Repel the foeman; nor his strength of arm \n ' The torrent stem; nor all a summer's day \n ' In dust and blood bear up against the foe. \n ' They fill no hostile trench, nor in their hands \n ' Shall battering engine or machine of war \n ' Dash down the rampart; and whate'er avails \n ' To stop their arrows, battles like a wall. \n \n ' Wide sweep their horsemen, fleeting in attack \n ' And light in onset, and their troops shall yield \n ' A camp, not take it: poisoned are their shafts; \n ' Nor do they dare a combat hand to hand; \n ' But as the winds may suffer, from afar \n ' They draw their bows at venture. Brave men love \n ' The sword which, wielded by a stalwart arm, \n ' Drives home the blow and makes the battle sure. \n ' Not such their weapons; and the first assault \n ' Shall force the flying Mede with coward hand \n 'And empty quiver from the field. His faith \n ' In poisoned blades is placed; but trustest thou \n ' Those who without such aid refuse the war? \n ' For such alliance wilt thou risk a death, \n ' With all the world between thee and thy home? \n ' Shall some barbarian earth or lowly grave \n ' Enclose thee perishing? E'en that were shame \n ' While Crassus seeks a sepulchre in vain. \n ' Thy lot is happy; death, unfeared by men, \n ' Is thy worst doom, Pompeius; but no death \n ' Awaits Cornelia-such a fate for her \n ' This king shall not reserve; for know not we \n ' The hateful secrets of barbarian love, \n ' Blind as of savage beasts? That palace knows \n ' No laws of kin: the royal bed is foul \n ' With concubines. The tale of that one crime \n ' Of old by OEdipus unwitting wrought \n ' Made nations shudder at the name of Thebes : \n ' How many an offspring of such foul embrace \n Has held the Parthian throne? Where incest's right \n 'What shall be wickedness? This gracious dame \n 'Born of Metellus, noblest blood of Rome , \n 'Shall share the couch of the barbarian king \n ' With thousand others: yet in savage joy, \n 'Proud of her former husbands, he may grant \n 'Some larger share of favour; and the fates \n May seem to smile on Parthia ; for the spouse \n ' Of Crassus, captive, shall to him be brought \n ' As spoil of former conquest. If the wound \n ' Dealt in that fell defeat in eastern lands \n ' Still stirs thy heart, then double is the shame \n 'First to have waged the war upon ourselves, \n ' Then ask the foe for succour. For what blame \n ' Can rest on thee or Caesar worse than this, \n 'That in the clash of conflict ye forgot \n ' For Crassus' slaughtered troops the vengeance due? \n 'First should united Rome upon the Mede \n \n 'Have poured her captains, and the troops who guard \n 'The northern frontier from the Dacian hordes; \n 'And all her legions should have left the Rhine \n \n 'Free to the Teuton, till the Parthian dead \n ' Were piled in heaps upon the sands that hide \n ' Our heroes slain; and haughty Babylon \n \n 'Lay at her victor's feet. To this foul peace \n 'We pray an end; and if Thessalia 's day \n 'Has closed our warfare, let the conqueror march \n 'Straight on our Parthian foe. Then should this heart, \n 'Then only, leap at Caesar's triumph won. \n 'Go thou and pass Araxes' chilly stream \n 'On this thine errand; and the mournful ghost \n 'Pierced by the Scythian shaft shall greet thee thus: \n ' \"Dost thou, to whom our wandering shades have looked \n '\" For vengeance and for war, seek from the foe \n '\"A treaty and a peace? \" And there profuse \n Shall meet thee sad memorials of the rout: \n 'Red is yon wall where passed their headless trunks; \n ' Euphrates here engulfed them, Tigris there \n ' Cast up to perish. Gaze on such array, \n 'And thou canst supplicate at Caesar's feet \n ' In mid Thessalia seated. Nay, thy glance \n ' Turn on the Roman world, and if thou fear'st \n King Juba faithless and the southern realms, \n Then seek we Pharos. Egypt on the west \n Girt by the trackless Syrtes forces back \n By sevenfold stream the ocean; rich in glebe \n And gold and merchandise; and proud of Nile \n \n Asks for no rain from heaven. Now holds this boy \n Her sceptre, owed to thee; his guardian thou : \n And who shall fear this shadow of a name? \n Hope not from monarchs old, whose shame is fled, \n Or laws or troth or honour of the gods: \n New kings bring mildest sway.' His words prevailed \n Upon his hearers. With what freedom speaks, \n When states are trembling, patriot despair! \n Pompeius' voice was quelled.\n \n \n For Cyprus then \n They shaped their course, whose altars more than all \n The goddess loves who from the Paphian wave \n Sprang, mindful of her birth, if such be truth, \n And gods have origin. Past the craggy isle \n Pompeius sailing, left at length astern \n Its southern cape, and struck across the main \n With winds transverse and tides; nor reached the mount \n Grateful to sailors for its nightly gleam: \n But to the bounds of Egypt hardly won \n With battling canvas, where divided Nile \n \n Pours through the shallows his Pelusian stream. \n \n Now was the season when the heavenly scale \n Most nearly balances the varying hours, \n Once only equal; for the wintry day \n Repays to night her losses of the spring; \n And Magnus learning that th' Egyptian king \n Lay by Mount Casius, ere the sun was set \n Or flagged his canvas, thither steered his ship. \n Already had a horseman from the shore \n In rapid gallop to the trembling court \n Brought news their guest was come. Short was the time \n For counsel given; but in haste were met \n All who advised the base Pellaean king, \n Monsters, inhuman; there Achoreus sat \n Less harsh in failing years, in Memphis born \n Of empty rites, and guardian of the rise \n \n Of fertilising Nile . While he was priest \n Not only once had Apis lived the space \n Marked by the crescent on his sacred brow. \n First was his voice, for Magnus raised and troth \n And for the pledges of the king deceased: \n But, skilled in counsel meet for shameless minds \n And tyrant hearts, Pothinus, dared to claim \n Judgment of death on Magnus. ' Laws and right \n ' Make many guilty, Ptolemaeus king. \n ' And faith thus lauded brings its punishment \n ' When it supports the fallen. To the fates \n ' Yield thee, and to the gods; the wretched shun \n ' But seek the happy. As the stars from earth \n ' Differ, and fire from ocean, so from right \n 'Expedience. The tyrant's shorn of strength \n 'Who ponders justice; and regard for right \n 'Brings ruin on a throne. The power to sin, \n 'Swords drawn at will, the tyrant king protect; \n 'And savage deeds find safety when they're done. \n 'Who would be righteous, let him flee the throne, \n 'For right's the bane of rule. He lives in dread \n 'Who shrinks from cruelty. Nor let this chief \n 'Unpunished scorn thy youth, who thinks that thou \n 'Not even the conquered from our shore canst bar. \n 'Nor to a stranger, if thou wouldst not reign, \n 'Resign thy sceptre, for the ties of blood \n 'Speak for thy banished sister. Let her rule \n 'O'er Nile and Pharos: we shall at the least \n 'Preserve our Egypt from the Latian arms. \n 'What Magnus owned not ere the war was done, \n No more shall Caesar. Driven from all the world, \n 'Trusting no more to Fortune, now he seeks \n 'Some foreign nation which may share his fate. \n 'Shades of the slaughtered in the civil war \n 'Compel him: nor from Caesar's arms alone \n 'But from the Senate also does he fly, \n 'Whose blood outpoured has gorged Thessalian fowl; \n 'Monarchs he fears whose all he has destroyed, \n 'And nations piled in one ensanguined heap, \n 'By him deserted. Victim of the blow \n ' Thessalia dealt, refused in every land, \n ' He asks for help from ours not yet betrayed. \n ' But none than Egypt with this chief from Rome \n \n ' Has juster quarrel; who has sought with arms \n ' To stain our Pharos, distant from the strife \n 'And peaceful ever, and to make our realm \n 'Suspected by his victor. Why alone \n 'Should this our country please thee in thy fall? \n ' Why bring'st thou here the burden of thy fates, \n ' Pharsalia's curse? In Caesar's eyes long since \n 'We have offence which by the sword alone \n ' Can find its condonation, in that we \n 'By thy persuasion from the Senate gained \n 'This our dominion. By our prayers we helped \n ' If not by arms thy cause. This sword, which fate \n ' Bids us make ready, not for thee I hold \n ' Prepared, but for the vanquished; and thy heart \n '(I had preferred thy kinsman's) shall I pierce: \n ' For to his side, as all things, are we borne. \n ' And dost thou doubt, since thou art in my power, \n 'Thou art my victim? By what trust in us \n 'Cam'st thou, unhappy? Scarce our people tills \n ' The fields, though softened by the refluent Nile : \n ' Know well our strength, and know we can no more. \n ' Rome 'neath the ruin of Pompeius lies: \n 'Shalt thou, O king, uphold him? Shalt thou dare \n ' To stir Pharsalia's ashes and to call \n ' War to thy kingdom? Ere the fight was fought \n ' We joined not either army-shall we now \n ' Make Magnus friend whom all the world deserts? \n 'And fling a challenge to the conquering chief \n 'And all his proud successes? Fair is help \n 'Lent in disaster, yet reserved for those \n 'Whom fortune favours. Faith her friends selects \n 'Not from the wretched.'\n \n \n Then they all decree \n The crime's accomplishment. Proud is the boy king \n Of such unwonted honour, that his slaves \n So soon give power for so great a deed. \n They choose Achillas for the work of death; \n And where the treacherous shore in Casian sands \n Runs out, and shallow waters of the sea \n Attest the Syrtes near, in little boat \n He and his partners in the monstrous crime \n With swords embark. Ye gods! and shall the Nile \n \n And barbarous Memphis and th' effeminate crew \n That throngs Pelusian Canopus raise \n Its thoughts to such an enterprise? Do thus \n Our fates press on the world? Is Rome thus fallen \n That in our civil frays the Pharian sword \n Finds place, or Egypt ? 0, may civil war \n Be thus far faithful that the hand which strikes \n Be of our kindred; and the foreign fiend \n Held worlds apart! Pompeius, great in soul, \n Noble in spirit, had deserved a death \n From Caesar's self. And, king, hast thou no fear \n At such a ruin of so great a name? \n And dost thou dare when heaven's high thunder rolls, \n Thou, puny boy, to mingle with its tones \n Thine impure utterance? Had he not won \n A world by arms, and thrice in triumph scaled \n The sacred Capitol, and vanquished kings, \n And championed the Roman Senate's cause; \n He, kinsman of the victor? 'Twas enough \n To cause forbearance in a Pharian king, \n That he was Roman. Wherefore with thy sword \n Dost stab our breasts? Thou know'st not, impious boy, \n How stand thy fortunes; now no more by right \n Hast thou the sceptre of the land of Nile ; \n For prostrate, vanquished in the civil wars \n Is he who gave it. \n Furling now his sails, \n Magnus with oars approached th' accursed land, \n When in their little boat the murderous crew \n Drew nigh. and feigning from th' Egyptian court \n A ready welcome, blamed the double tides \n Broken by shallows, and their scanty beach \n Unfit for fleets; and bade him to their craft \n Leaving his loftier ship. Had not the fates' \n Eternal and unalterable laws \n Called for their victim and decreed his end \n Now near at hand, his comrades' warning voice \n Yet might have stayed his course: for if the court \n To Magnus, who bestowed the Pharian crown, \n In truth were open, should not king and fleet \n In pomp have come to greet him? But he yields: \n The fates compel. Welcome to him was death \n Rather than fear. But, rushing to the side, \n His spouse would follow, for she dared not stay, \n Fearing the guile. Then he, ' Abide, my wife, \n And son, I pray you; from the shore afar \n ' Await my fortunes; mine shall be the life \n ' To test their honour.' But Cornelia still \n Withstood his bidding, and with arms outspread \n Frenzied she cried: ' And whither without me, \n ' Cruel, departest? Thou forbad'st me share \n ' Thy risks Thessalian; dost again command \n ' That I should part from thee? No happy star \n ' Breaks on our sorrow. If from every land \n ' Thou dost debar me, why didst turn aside \n ' In flight to Lesbos ? On the waves alone \n ' Am I thy fit companion? ' Thus in vain, \n Leaning upon the bulwark, dazed with dread; \n Nor could she turn her straining gaze aside, \n Nor see her parting husband. All the fleet \n Stood silent, anxious, waiting for the end: \n Not that they feared the murder which befell, \n But lest their leader might with humble prayer \n Kneel to the king he made. \n As Magnus passed, \n A Roman soldier from the Pharian boat, \n Septimius, salutes him. Gods of heaven! \n There stood he, minion to a barbarous king, \n Nor bearing still the javelin of Rome ; \n But vile in all his arms; giant in form \n Fierce, brutal, thirsting as a beast may thirst \n For carnage. Didst thou, Fortune, for the sake \n Of nations, spare to dread Pharsalus field \n This savage monster's blows? Or dost thou place \n Throughout the world, for thy mysterious ends, \n Some ministering swords for civil war? \n Thus, to the shame of victors and of gods, \n This story shall be told in days to come: \n A Roman swordsman, once within thy ranks, \n Slave to the orders of a puny prince, \n Severed Pompeius' neck. And what shall be \n Septimius' fame hereafter? By what name \n This deed be called, if Brutus wrought a crime? \n Now came the end, the latest hour of all: \n Rapt to the boat was Magnus, of himself \n No longer master, and the miscreant crew \n Unsheathed their swords; which when the chieftain saw \n He swathed his visage, for he scorned unveiled \n To yield his life to fortune; closed his eyes \n And held his breath within him, lest some word, \n Or sob escaped, might mar the deathless fame \n His deeds had won. And when within his side \n Achillas plunged his blade, nor sound nor cry \n He gave, but calm consented to the blow \n And proved himself in dying; in his breast \n These thoughts revolving: ' In the years to come \n ' Men shall make mention of our Roman toils, \n ' Gaze on this boat, ponder the Pharian faith; \n ' And think upon thy fame and all the years \n ' While Fortune smiled: but for the ills of life \n ' How thou couldst bear them, this men shall not know \n ' Save by thy death. Then weigh thou not the shame \n ' That waits on thine undoing. Whoso strikes, \n ' The blow is Caesar's. Men may tear this frame \n 'And cast it mangled to the winds of heaven; \n 'Yet have I prospered, nor can all the gods \n ' Call back my triumphs. Life may bring defeat, \n 'But death no misery. If my spouse and son \n 'Behold me murdered, silently the more \n ' I suffer: admiration at my death \n 'Shall prove their love.' So did Pompeius die, \n And so kept guard upon his thoughts in death.\n \n \n His spouse, less patient to behold the crime \n Than to endure it, filled the airs with cries; \n '0, husband, whom my wicked self hath slain! \n 'That lonely isle apart thy bane hath been \n 'And stayed thy coming. Caesar to the Nile \n \n 'Has won before us; for what other hand \n 'May do such work? But whosoe'er thou art \n 'Sent from the gods with power, for Caesar's ire, \n 'Or thine own sake, to slay, thou dost not know \n 'Where lies the heart of Magnus. Thou dost haste \n To deal the blow as he would have it fall. \n 'Let me die first, and let him seeing bear \n 'An agony no less than death can bring. \n 'No freedom mine from blame of war. Alone \n Of Roman wives, through oceans and through camps, \n Fearing no fates, I followed him afield; \n And in defeat when even monarchs feared \n Received my husband. Did I then deserve \n Thus to be left of thee, and didst thou seek \n To spare me? And when rushing on thine end \n Was I to live? Without the monarch's help \n Death shall be mine, either by headlong leap \n Beneath the waters; or some sailor's hand \n Shall bind around this neck the fatal cord; \n Or else some comrade, worthy of his chief, \n Drive to my heart his blade for Magnus' sake, \n And claim the service done to Caesar's arms. \n What! does your cruelty withhold my fate? \n Ah! still he lives, nor is it mine as yet \n To win this freedom; they forbid me death, \n Kept for the victor's triumph.' Thus she spake, \n While friendly hands upheld her fainting form; \n And sped the trembling vessel from the shore. \n Men say that Magnus, when the deadly blows \n Fell thick upon him, lost nor form divine, \n Nor venerated mien; and as they gazed \n Upon his lacerated head they marked \n Still on his features anger with the gods. \n For fierce Septimius in the very blow \n Made yet more black his crime-unwound the folds \n That swathed the face, and seized the noble head \n And drooping neck ere yet was fled the life: \n Then placed upon the bench; and with his blade \n Slow at its hideous task, and blows unskilled \n Hacked through the flesh and brake the knotted bone; \n For yet man had not learned by swoop of sword \n Deftly to lop the neck. Achillas claimed \n The gory head dissevered. What! shalt thou \n A Roman soldier, while thy blade yet reeks \n From Magnus' slaughter, play the second part \n To this base varlet of the Pharian king? \n Nor bear thyself the bleeding trophy home? \n Then, that the impious boy (ah! shameful fate) \n Might know the features of the hero slain, \n Seized by the locks, the dread of kings, which waved \n Upon his stately front, on Pharian pike \n The head was lifted; while almost the life \n Gave to the tongue its accents, and the eyes \n Were yet scarce glazed: that head at whose command \n Was peace or war, that tongue whose eloquent tones \n Would move assemblies, and that noble brow \n On which were showered the rewards of Rome . \n Nor to the tyrant did the sight suffice \n To prove the murder done. The perishing flesh, \n The tissues, and the brain he bids remove \n By art nefarious: the shrivelled skin \n Draws tight upon the bone; and poisonous juice \n Gives to the face its lineaments in death. \n Last of thy race, thou base degenerate boy, \n About to perish soon, and yield the throne \n To thine incestuous sister; while the Prince \n From Macedon here in consecrated vault \n Now rests, and ashes of the kings are closed \n In mighty pyramids, and lofty tombs \n Of thine unworthy fathers mark the graves; \n Shall Magnus' body hither and thither borne \n Be battered, headless, by the ocean wave? \n Too much it troubled thee to guard the corse \n Unmutilated, for his kinsman's eye \n To witness! Such the fate which Fortune kept \n With prosperous Pompeius to the end. \n 'Twas not for him in evil days some ray \n Of light to hope for. Shattered from the height \n Of power in one short moment to his death! \n Years of unbroken victories balanced down \n By one day's carnage! In his happy time \n Heaven did not harass him, nor did she spare \n In misery. Long Fortune held the hand \n That dashed him down. Now beaten by the sands, \n Torn upon rocks, the sport of ocean's waves \n Poured through its wounds, his headless carcase lies, \n Save by the lacerated trunk unknown.\n \n \n Yet ere the victor touched the Pharian sands \n Some scanty rites to Magnus Fortune gave, \n Lest he should want all burial. Pale with fear \n Came Cordus, hasting from his hiding place; \n Quaestor, he joined Pompeius on thy shore, \n Idalian Cyprus, bringing in his train \n A cloud of evils. Through the darkening shades \n Love for the dead compelled his trembling steps, \n Hard by the margin of the deep to search \n And drag to land his master. Through the clouds \n The moon shone sadly, and her rays were dim; \n But by its hue upon the hoary main \n He knew the body. In a fast embrace \n He holds it, wrestling with the greedy sea, \n And deftly watching for a refluent wave \n Gains help to bring his burden to the land. \n Then clinging to the loved remains, the wounds \n Washed with his tears, thus to the gods he speaks, \n And misty stars obscure: 'Here, Fortune, lies \n Pompeius, thine: no costly incense rare \n Or pomp of funeral he dares to ask; \n Nor that the smoke rise heavenward from his pyre \n With eastern odours rich; nor that the necks \n Of pious Romans bear him to the tomb, \n Their parent; while the forums shall resound \n ' With dirges; nor that triumphs won of yore \n 'Be borne before him; nor for sorrowing hosts \n 'To cast their weapons forth. Some little shell \n He begs as for the meanest, laid in which \n His mutilated corse may reach the flame. \n Grudge not his misery the pile of wood \n ' Lit by this menial hand. Is't not enough \n 'That his Cornelia with dishevelled hair \n ' Weeps not beside him at his obsequies, \n ' Nor with a last embrace shall place the torch \n ' Beneath her husband dead, but on the deep \n ' Hard by still wanders? ' \n Burning from afar \n He sees the pyre of some ignoble youth \n Deserted of his own, with none to guard: \n And quickly drawing from beneath the limbs \n Some glowing logs, ' Whoe'er thou art,' he said, \n Neglected shade, uncared for, dear to none, \n Yet happier than Pompeius in thy death, \n Pardon I ask that this my stranger hand \n ' Should violate thy tomb. Yet if to shades \n 'Be sense or memory, gladly shalt thou yield \n 'This from thy pyre to Magnus. 'Twere thy shame, \n 'Blessed with due burial, if his remains \n Were homeless.' Speaking thus, the wood aflame \n Back to the headless trunk at speed he bore, \n Which hanging on the margin of the deep, \n Almost the sea had won. In sandy trench \n The gathered fragments of a broken boat, \n Trembling, he placed around the noble limbs. \n No pile above the corse nor under lay, \n Nor was the fire beneath. Then as he crouched \n Beside the blaze, ' 0, greatest chief,' he cried, \n Majestic champion of Hesperia's name, \n 'If to be tossed unburied on the deep \n Rather than these poor rites thy shade prefer, \n 'From these mine offices thy mighty soul \n Withdraw, Pompeius. Injuries dealt by fate \n Command this duty, lest some bird or beast \n 'Or ocean monster, or fierce Caesar's wrath \n 'Should venture aught upon thee. Take the fire; \n All that thou canst; by Roman hand at least \n 'Enkindled. And should Fortune grant return \n 'To loved Hesperia's land, not here shall rest \n 'Thy sacred ashes; but within an urn \n Cornelia, from this humble hand received, \n Shall place them. Here upon a meagre stone \n We draw the characters to mark thy tomb. \n These letters reading may some kindly friend \n 'Bring back thine head, dissevered, and may grant \n 'Full funeral honours to thine earthly frame.' \n Then did he cherish the enfeebled fire \n Till Magnus' body mingled with its flames. \n But now the harbinger of coming dawn \n Had paled the constellations: he in fear \n Seeks for his hiding place. Whom dost thou dread, \n Madman, what punishment for such a crime, \n For which thy fame by rumour trumpet-tongued \n Has been sent down to ages? Praise is thine \n For this thy work, at impious Caesar's hands; \n Sure of a pardon, go; confess thy task, \n And beg the head dissevered. But his work \n Was still unfinished, and with pious hand \n (Fearing some foe) he seizes on the bones \n Now half consumed, and sinews; and the wave \n Pours in upon them, and in shallow trench \n Commits them to the earth; and lest some breeze \n Might bear away the ashes, or by chance \n Some sailor's anchor might disturb the tomb, \n A stone he places, and with stick half burned \n Traces the sacred name: Here Magnus lies. \n And art thou, Fortune, pleased that such a spot \n Should be his tomb which even Caesar's self \n Had chosen, rather than permit his corse \n To rest unburied? Why, with thoughtless hand \n Confine his shade within the narrow bounds \n Of this poor sepulchre? Where the furthest sand \n Hangs on the margin of the baffled deep \n Cabined he lies; yet where the Roman name \n Is known, and Empire, such in truth shall be \n The boundless measure of his resting-place. \n Blot out this stone, this proof against the gods! \n OEta finds room for Hercules alone, \n And Nysa 's mountain for the Bromian god; \n \n Not all the lands of Egypt should suffice \n For Magnus dead: and shall one Pharian stone \n Mark his remains? Yet should no turf disclose \n His title, peoples of the earth would fear \n To spurn his ashes, and the sands of Nile \n \n No foot would tread. But if the stone deserves \n So great a name, then add his mighty deeds: \n Write Lepidus conquered and the Alpine war, \n And fierce Sertorius by his aiding arm \n O'erthrown; the chariots which as knight he drove; \n \n Cilician pirates driven from the main, \n And Commerce safe to nations; Eastern kings \n Defeated and the barbarous Northern tribes; \n Write that from arms he ever sought the robe; \n Write that content upon the Capitol \n Thrice only triumphed he, nor asked his due. \n What mausoleum were for such a chief \n A fitting monument? This paltry stone \n Records no syllable of the lengthy tale \n Of honours: and the name which men have read \n Upon the sacred temples of the gods, \n And lofty arches built of hostile spoils, \n On desolate sands here marks his lowly grave \n With characters obscure, such as erect \n No traveller could read, and Roman guest \n Without a hand to guide would pass unseen.\n \n \n Thou land of Egypt , doomed to bear a part \n In civil warfare, not unreasoning sang \n High Cumae 's prophetess, when she forbad \n \n The stream Pelusian to the Roman arms, \n And all the banks which in the summer-tide \n Are covered by his flood. What grievous curse \n Shall I call down upon thee? May the Nile \n \n Turn back his water to his source, thy fields \n Want for the winter rain, and all the land \n Crumble to desert wastes! We in our fanes \n Have known thine Isis and thy hideous gods, \n Half hounds, half human, and the drum that bids \n To sorrow, and Osiris, whom thy dirge \n \n Proclaims for man. Thou, Egypt , in thy sand \n Our dead containest. Nor, though her temples now \n Serve a proud master, has Rome yet required \n Pompeius' ashes: in a foreign land \n Still lies her chief. But though men feared at first \n The victor's ire, now, Rome , at length receive \n Thy Magnus' bones, if still the restless wave \n Has not prevailed upon that hated shore. \n Shall men have fear of tombs and dread to move \n The dust of those who should be with the gods? \n 0, may my country place the crime on me, \n If crime it be, to violate such a tomb \n Of such a hero, and to bear his dust \n Home to Ausonia. Happy, happy he \n Who bears such holy office in his trust! \n \n Haply when famine rages in the land \n Or burning southern winds, or fires abound \n And earthquake shocks, and Rome shall pray an end \n From angry heaven-by the gods' command, \n In council given, shalt thou be transferred \n To thine own city, and the priest shall bear \n Thy sacred ashes to their last abode. \n Who now may seek beneath the raging Crab \n Or hot Syene 's waste, or Thebes athirst \n Under the rainy Pleiades, to gaze \n On Nile 's broad stream; or whoso may exchange \n On the Red Sea or in Arabian ports \n Some Eastern merchandise, shall turn in awe \n To view the venerable stone that marks \n Thy grave, Pompeius; and shall worship more \n Thy dust commingled with the arid sand, \n Thy shade though exiled, than the fane upreared \n \n On Casius' mount to Jove! In temples shrined \n And gold, thy memory were viler deemed: \n Fortune lies with thee in thy lowly tomb \n And makes thee rival of Olympus ' king. \n More awful is that stone by Libyan seas \n Lashed, than are Conquerors' altars. There a god \n Rests in dark earth to whom all men shall bow \n More than to gods Tarpeian: and his name \n Shall shine the brighter in the days to come \n For that no marble tomb about him stands \n Nor lofty monument. That little dust \n Time soon shall scatter and the tomb shall fall \n And all the proofs shall perish of his death. \n And happier days shall come when men shall gaze \n Upon the stone, nor yet believe the tale: \n And Egypt 's fable, that she holds the grave \n Of great Pompeius, be believed no more \n Than Crete 's which boasts the sepulchre of Jove. \n \n "

            "0":"\n YET in those ashes on the Pharian shore, \n In that small heap of dust, was not confined \n So great a shade; but from th' ignoble pyre \n And limbs half burnt sprang forth and sought the sky \n Where dwells the Thunderer. Black the space of air \n Upreaching to the poles that bear on high \n The constellations in their nightly round; \n There 'twixt the orbit of the moon and earth \n Abide those lofty spirits, half divine, \n Who by their blameless lives and fire of soul \n Are fit to tolerate the pure expanse \n That bounds the lower ether: there shall dwell, \n Where nor the monument encased in gold, \n Nor richest incense, shall suffice to bring \n The buried dead, in union with the spheres, \n Pompeius' spirit. When with heavenly light \n His soul was filled, first on the wandering stars \n And fixed orbs he bent his wondering gaze; \n Then saw what darkness veils our earthly day \n And scorned the insults heaped upon his corse. \n Next o'er Emathian plains he winged his flight, \n And ruthless Caesar's standards, and the fleet \n Tossed on the deep: in Brutus' blameless breast \n Tarried awhile, and roused his angered soul \n To reap the vengeance; last possessed the mind \n Of haughty Cato. \n He while yet the scales \n Were poised and balanced, nor the war had given \n The world its master, hated both the chiefs, \n But followed Magnus for the Senate's cause \n And for his country: now in all his heart \n Was bound to Magnus, since Pharsalia's field. \n Shorn of her guardian his country found \n In him her guide; the people's trembling limbs \n He cherished with new hope, and weapons gave \n Back to the craven hands that cast them forth. \n Nor yet for empire did he wage the war \n Nor fearing slavery: nor in arms achieved \n Aught for himself: freedom, since Magnus fell, \n The aim of all his host. And lest the foe \n In rapid course triumphant should collect \n His scattered bands, he sought Corcyra 's gulfs \n Concealed, and bore in thousand ships away \n The fragments of the ruin wrought in Thrace . \n Who in such mighty navy had believed \n A host defeated sailed upon the main \n Thronging the sea with keels? Round Malea's cape \n And Taenarus open to the shades below \n And fair Cythera 's isle, th' advancing fleet \n Sweeps o'er the yielding wave, by northern breeze \n Borne past the Cretan shores. But Phycus dared \n Refuse her harbour, and th' avenging hand \n Left her in ruins. Thus with gentle airs \n They glide along the main and reach the shore \n From Palinurus named; for not alone \n On seas Italian, Pilot of the deep, \n Hast thou thy monument; and Libya too \n Claims that her tranquil harbours pleased thy soul. \n Then in the distance on the main arose \n The shining canvas of a stranger fleet, \n Or friend or foe they knew not. Yet they dread \n In every keel the presence of that chief \n Their fear-compelling conqueror. But in truth \n That navy tears and sorrow bore, and woes \n To make e'en Cato weep. \n For when in vain \n Cornelia prayed her stepson and the crew \n To stay their flight, lest haply from the shore \n Back to the sea might float the headless corse; \n And when the flame arising marked the place \n Of that unhallowed rite, ' Fortune, didst thou \n Judge me unfit,' she cried, ' to light the pyre \n 'To cast myself upon the hero dead, \n 'The lock to sever, and compose the limbs \n 'Tossed by the cruel billows of the deep, \n To shed a flood of tears upon his wounds, \n To fill my robe with ashes from his urn, \n And scatter in the temples of the gods \n All that I could, his dust? That pyre bestows \n No honour, haply by some Pharian hand \n Piled up in insult to his mighty shade. \n Happy the Crassi lying on the waste \n Unburied. To the greater shame of heaven \n ' Pompeius has such funeral. And shall this \n ' For ever be my lot? her husbands slain \n ' Cornelia ne'er enclose within the tomb, \n ' Nor shed the tear beside the urn that holds \n ' The ashes of the loved? Yet for my grief \n ' What boots or monument or ordered pomp? \n ' Dost thou not, impious, upon thy heart \n · Pompeius' image, and upon thy soul \n ' Bear ineffaceable? Dust closed in urns \n ' Is for the wife who would survive her lord, \n ' Not such as thee, Cornelia! And yet \n 'Yon scanty light that glimmers from afar \n ' Upon the Pharian shore, somewhat of thee \n ' Recalls, Pompeius! Now the flame sinks down \n ' And smoke drifts up across the eastern sky \n ' Bearing thine ashes, and the rising wind \n ' Sighs hateful in the sail. To me no more \n ' Dearer than this whatever land has given \n ' Pompeius victory, nor the frequent car \n ' That carried him in triumph to the hill; \n ' Gone is that happy husband from my thoughts; \n ' Here did I lose the hero whom I knew; \n ' Here let me stay; his presence shall endear \n ' The sands of Nile where fell the fatal blow. \n ' Thou, Sextus, brave the chances of the war \n 'And bear Pompeius' standard through the world. \n ' For thus thy father spake within mine ear: \n ' \" When sounds my fatal hour let both my sons \n ' \" Urge on the war; nor let some Caesar find \n ' \" Room for an empire, while shall live on earth \n ' \" Still one in whom Pompeius' blood shall run. \n ' \" This your appointed task; all cities strong \n ' \" In freedom of their own, all kingdoms urge \n ' \" To join the combat; for Pompeius calls. \n ' \" Nor shall a chieftain of that famous name \n ' ' Ride on the seas and fail to find a fleet. \n ' Urged by his sire's unconquerable will \n ' \" And mindful of his rights, mine heir shall rouse \n ' \" All nations to the conflict. One alone, \n ' \" (Should he contend for freedom) may ye serve; \n ' \" Cato, none else! \" Thus have I kept the faith; \n ' Thy plot prevailed upon me, and I lived \n 'Thy mandate to discharge. Now through the void \n · Of space, and shades of Hell, if such there be, \n ' I follow; yet how distant be my doom \n ' I know not: first my spirit must endure \n ' The punishment of life, which saw thine end \n ' And could survive it; sighs shall break my heart, \n \"Tears shall dissolve it: sword nor noose I need \n Nor headlong plunge. 'Twere shameful since thy death, \n ' Were aught but grief required to cause my own.' \n \n She seeks the cabin, veiled, in funeral garb, \n In tears to find her solace, and to love \n Grief in her husband's room; no tempest howl \n Among the shrouds, no angered waves aroused \n Her soul, nor cry of sailors in dismay: \n For life their prayers; not hers: and prone she lies \n Resigned to death and welcoming the storm.\n \n \n First reached they Cyprus on the foamy brine; \n Then as the eastern breeze more gently held \n The favouring deep, they touched the Libyan shore \n Where stood the camp of Cato. Sad as one \n Who deep in fear presages ills to come, \n Cnaeus beheld his brother and his band \n Of patriot comrades. Swift into the wave \n He leaped and cried, ' Where, brother, is our sire? \n ' Still stands our country mistress of the world, \n ' Or are we fallen, Rome with Magnus' death \n ' Rapt to the shades? ' Thus he: but Sextus said \n ' Oh happy thou who by report alone \n ' Hear'st of the deed that chanced on yonder shore! \n 'These eyes that saw, my brother, share the guilt. \n ' Not Caesar wrought his death, nor any chief \n ' Worthy to cause the ruin of our sire. \n ' He fell by order of that shameful king \n ' Who rules o'er Nilus; trusting to the gods \n ' Who shield the guest, and to his princely boon \n ' Of yore-a victim for the realm he gave. \n ' I saw them pierce our noble father's breast; \n ' Yet deeming not the petty Pharian prince \n ' So fell a deed would dare, on Egypt 's strand \n ' I thought great Caesar stood. But worse than all, \n ' Worse than the wounds which gaped upon his frame \n ' Struck me with horror to the inmost heart, \n ' Our murdered father's head, shorn from the trunk \n ' And borne aloft on javelin; this sight, \n ' As rumour said, the cruel victor asked \n ' To feast his eyes, and prove the bloody deed. \n ' For whether ravenous birds and Pharian dogs \n ' Have torn his corse asunder, or a fire \n ' Consumed it, which with stealthy flame arose, \n ' I know not. For the fates' unjust decree \n 'Which reft his limbs asunder, I forgive \n ' The gods: I weep the part preserved by men.' \n Thus Sextus spake: but Cnaeus at the tale \n Restrained the tear, and for his father's shame \n Flamed into fury: ' Launch our navies forth, \n ' Ye sailors, from the shore, by stalwart arms \n ' Forced through the deep against opposing winds: \n ' Captains, lead on: for civil strife ne'er gave \n ' So great a prize; to lay in earth the limbs \n 'Of Magnus, and avenge him with the blood \n 'Of that unmanly tyrant. Shall I spare \n Great Alexander's fort, nor sack the shrine \n And plunge his body in the tideless marsh? \n Nor drag Amasis from the Pyramids, \n 'And all their ancient kings, to swim the Nile ? \n 'Torn from his tomb, that god of all mankind \n 'Isis, unburied, shall avenge thy shade; \n And veiled Osiris shall I hurl abroad \n 'And sacred Apis; and with these their gods \n 'I'll light a furnace that shall burn the head \n 'They held in insult. Thus their land shall pay \n 'Atonement to the shade of Magnus dead. \n No husbandman shall live to till the fields \n Nor reap the benefit of brimming Nile . \n 'Thou only, Father, gods and men alike \n 'Fallen and perished, shalt possess the land.' \n Such were the words he spake; and soon the fleet \n Had dared the angry deep: but Cato 's voice \n While praising, calmed the youthful chieftain's rage. \n Meanwhile, when Magnus' fate was known, the air \n Sounded with lamentations which the shore \n Re-echoed; never through the ages past, \n By history recorded, was it known \n That thus a people mourned their ruler's death. \n Yet more, when worn with tears, her pallid cheek \n Veiled by her loosened tresses, from the ship \n Cornelia came, they wept and beat the breast. \n Soon as she stood upon the friendly land, \n Ill-fated Magnus' spoils, his arms of price, \n His gold-embroidered robe, three times of old \n \n Displayed to Jove upon the hill, she placed \n Upon the mournful fire. Such was for her \n The dust of Magnus. And her love so touched \n The hearts of all, that soon along the shore \n Pyres blazed in memory of Pharsalia's dead. \n 'Tis thus in winter to depastured fields \n By frequent fires th' Apulian herdsman seeks \n To render verdant growth; and glow with flame \n Garganus' slopes, and Vultur, and the meads \n Of warm Matinum. \n Yet Pompeius' shade \n Nought else so gratified, not all the blame \n The people dared to heap upon the gods, \n For him their hero slain, as these few words \n From Cato's noble breast instinct with truth: \n 'Gone is a citizen who though no peer \n \n 'Of those who disciplined the state of yore \n In due submission to the bounds of right, \n 'Yet in this age irreverent of law \n 'Has played a noble part. Great was his power, \n 'But freedom safe: when all the plebs was prone \n 'To be his slaves, he chose the private gown; \n 'So that the Senate ruled the Roman state, \n 'Its chief was Cato: nought by right of arms \n 'He e'er demanded: willing took he gifts \n 'Yet from a willing giver: wealth was his \n Vast, yet the coffers of the State he filled \n 'Beyond his own. He seized upon the sword, \n 'Knew when to sheath it; war did he prefer \n 'To arts of peace, yet armed loved peace the more. \n 'Pleased took he power, pleased he laid it down: \n 'Chaste was his home and simple, by his wealth \n 'Untarnished. Mid the peoples great his name \n \n And venerated : to his native Rome \n \n He wrought much good. True faith in liberty \n Long since with Marius and Sulla fled: \n Now when Pompeius has been reft away \n 'Its counterfeit has perished. Now unshamed \n Shall seize the despot on Imperial power, \n 'Unshamed shall cringe the Senate. Happy he \n Who with disaster found his latest breath \n 'And met the Pharian sword prepared to slay. \n Life might have been his lot, in despot rule, \n Prone at his kinsman's throne. Best gift of all \n 'The knowledge how to die; next, death compelled. \n If cruel Fortune doth reserve for me \n An alien conqueror, may Juba be \n As Ptolemaeus. So he take my head \n My body grace his triumph, if he will.'\n \n \n More than had Rome resounded with his praise \n Words such as these gave honour to the shade \n Of that most noble dead. Meanwhile the crowd \n Weary of warfare, since Pompeius' fall, \n Broke into discord, as their ancient chief \n Cilician called them to desert the camp. \n They seize upon their ships and float the wave; \n But Cato hailed them from the nearest shore; \n ' Untamed Cilician, is thy course now set \n ' For Ocean theft again; Pompeius gone, \n ' Pirate art thou once more? ' Then all the air \n Hummed with the murmur of the throng; and one \n Resolved on flight thus answered, ' Pardon, chief, \n ' Twas love of Magnus, not of civil war, \n ' That led us to the fight: his side was ours: \n ' With him whom all the world preferred to peace, \n ' Our cause is perished. Let us seek our homes \n ' Long since unseen, our children and our wives. \n If nor the rout on dread Pharsalia 's field \n Nor yet Pompeius' death shall close the war, \n Whence comes the end? Our span of life is fled: \n Give death safe haven, give old age his pyre. \n Scarce even to its captains civil strife \n Concedes due burial. Nor in our defeat \n Does Fortune threaten us with the savage yoke \n Of distant nations. In the garb of Rome \n \n And with her rights, I leave thee. Who had been \n Second to Magnus living, he shall be \n My first hereafter: to that sacred shade \n Be the prime honour. Chance of war appoints \n My lord but not my leader. Thee alone \n I followed, Magnus; after thee the fates. \n 'Nor have I right to hope for victory now, \n Nor wish: our Thracian array is fled \n 'In Caesar's triumph, whose all-potent star \n Of fortune rules the world; and none but he \n Has power to keep or save. That civil war \n Which while Pompeius lived was loyalty \n Is impious now. Let country lead thee on, \n ' Cato , and public right; but let us seek \n ' The standards of the Consul.' Thus he spake \n And with him leaped into the ship a throng \n Of eager comrades. \n Then was Rome undone, \n For all the shore was stirring with a crowd \n Athirst for slavery. But burst these words \n From Cato 's blameless breast: ' Then with like vows \n ' As Caesar's rival host ye too did seek \n ' A lord and master! not for Rome the fight, \n But for Pompeius! For that now no more \n 'Ye fight for tyranny, but for yourselves, \n 'Not for some despot chief, ye live and die; \n ' Since now 'tis safe to conquer and no lord \n ' Shall rob you, victors, of a world subdued- \n ' Ye flee the war, and on your abject necks \n 'Feel for the absent yoke; nor can endure \n ' Without a despot! Yet to men the prize \n ' Were worth the danger. Magnus might have used \n ' To evil ends your blood; refuse ye now, \n ' With liberty so near, your country's call? \n ' Now lives one tyrant only of the three; \n ' Thus far in favour of the laws have wrought \n ' The Pharian weapons and the Parthian bow; \n ' Not you, degenerate! Begone, and spurn \n ' This gift of Ptolemaeus. Who would think \n ' Your hands were stained with blood? The foe will deem \n ' That you upon that dread Thessalian day \n ' First turned your backs. Then flee in safety, flee! \n ' By neither battle nor blockade subdued \n ' Caesar shall give you life! 0 slaves most base, \n ' Your former master slain, ye seek his heir! \n ' Why doth it please you not yet more to earn \n 'Than life and pardon? Bear across the sea \n ' Metellus' daughter, Magnus' weeping spouse, \n ' And both his sons; outstrip the Pharian gift. \n ' Nor spare this head, which, laid before the feet \n ' Of that detested tyrant, shall deserve \n 'A full reward. Thus, cowards, shall ye learn \n ' In that ye followed me how great your gain. \n ' Quick to your task and purchase thus with blood \n 'Your claim on Caesar. 'Tis a dastard crime; \n ' Flight without slaughter!' \n \n Cato thus recalled \n The parting vessels. So when bees in swarm \n Desert their empty comb, forget the hive, \n Ceasing to cling together, and with wings \n Untrammelled seek the air, nor slothful light \n On thyme to taste its bitterness-then rings \n The Phrygian gong-at once they pause aloft \n Astonied; and with love of toil resumed \n Through all the flowers for their honey store \n In ceaseless wanderings search; the shepherd joys, \n Sure that th' Hyblaean mead for him has kept \n His cottage store, the riches of his home. \n Now in the active conduct of the war \n Were brought to discipline their minds, untaught \n To bear repose; first on the sandy shore \n Toiling they learned fatigue: then stormed thy walls, \n \n Cyrene ; prizeless, for to Cato 's mind \n 'Twas prize enough to conquer. Juba next \n He bids approach, though Nature on the path \n Had placed the Syrtes; which his sturdy heart \n Aspired to conquer. Either at the first \n When Nature gave the universe its form \n She left this region neither land nor sea; \n Not wholly shrunk, so that it should receive \n The ocean flood; nor firm enough to stand \n Against its buffets-all the pathless coast \n Lies in uncertain shape; earth by the deep \n Is parted from the land; on sandy banks \n The seas are broken, and from shoal to shoal \n The waves advance to sound upon the shore. \n Nature, in spite, thus left her work undone, \n Unfashioned to men's use-Or else of old \n A foaming ocean filled the wide expanse, \n But Titan feeding from the briny depths \n His burning fires (near to the zone of heat) \n Reduced the waters. Still the main contends; \n But in long time the Sun's destructive rays \n Shall make the Syrtes land, and shallow pools \n E'en now proclaim the sea's defeat to come.\n \n \n When first the billows to the fleet gave way, \n Black from the sky rushed down a southern gale \n Upon his realm, and from the watery plain \n Drave back th' invading ships, and from the shoals \n Compelled the waves, and in the middle sea \n Raised up a bank. Forth flew the bellying sails \n Beyond the prows, despite the ropes that dared \n Resist the tempest's fury; and for those \n Who prescient housed their canvas to the storm, \n Bare-masted they were driven from their course. \n Best was their lot who gained the open waves \n Of ocean; others lightened of their masts \n Shook off the tempest; but a sweeping tide \n Hurried them southwards, victor of the gale. \n Some freed of shallows on a bank were forced \n Which broke the deep: their ship in part was fast, \n Part hanging on the sea; their fates in doubt. \n Fierce rage the waves till hems them in the land; \n Nor Auster's force in frequent buffets spent \n Prevails upon the shore. High from the main, \n By seas inviolate, one bank of sand \n Far from the coast arose; there watched in vain \n The storm-tossed mariners, their keel aground, \n No shore descrying. Thus in sea were lost \n Some portion, but the major part by helm \n And rudder guided, and by pilots' hands \n Who knew the devious channels, safe at length \n Floated the marsh of Triton loved (as saith \n The fable) by that god, whose sounding shell \n \n All seas and shores re-echo; and by her, \n Pallas, who springing from her father's head \n First lit on Libya , nearest land to heaven, \n (As by its heat is proved); here on the brink \n She stood, reflected in the placid wave \n And called herself Tritonis. Lethe's flood \n Flows silent near, in fable from a source \n Infernal sprung, oblivion in his stream; \n Here, too, that garden of the Hesperids, \n Its boughs all golden, where of old his watch \n The sleepless dragon held. Shame be on him \n Who calls upon the poet for the proof \n Of that which in the ancient days befell; \n But here were golden groves by yellow growth \n Weighed down in richness, here a maiden band \n Were guardians; and a serpent, on whose eyes \n Sleep never fell, was coiled around the trees, \n Whose branches bowed beneath their ruddy load. \n But great Alcides stripped the goodly boughs \n Of all their riches, left them poor and light, \n And bore the shining fruit to Argos ' king. \n Driven on the Libyan realms, more fruitful here, \n Pompeius stayed the fleet, nor further dared \n To Garamantian waves. But Cato's soul \n Leaped in his breast, impatient of delay, \n To pass the Syrtes by a landward march, \n And trusting to their swords, 'gainst tribes unknown \n To lead his legions. And the storm which closed \n The main to navies gave them hope of rain; \n Nor biting frosts they feared, in Libyan clime; \n Nor suns too scorching in the falling year. \n Thus ere they trod the deserts, Cato spake: \n ' Ye men of Rome, who through mine arms alone \n ' Can find the death ye covet, and shall fall \n ' With pride unbroken should the fates command, \n ' Meet this your weighty task, your high emprise \n ' With hearts resolved to conquer. For we march \n ' On sterile wastes, burnt regions of the world; \n ' Scarce are the wells, and Titan from the height \n ' Burns pitiless, unclouded; and the slime \n ' Of poisonous serpents fouls the dusty earth. \n ' Yet shall men venture for the love of laws \n ' And country perishing, upon the sands \n ' Of trackless Libya ; men who brave in soul \n ' Rely not on the end, and in attempt \n ' Will risk their all. 'Tis not in Cato's thoughts \n ' On this our enterprise to lead a band \n ' Blind to the truth, unwitting of the risk. \n ' Nay, give me comrades for the danger's sake, \n ' Whom I shall see for honour and for Rome \n \n ' Bear up against the worst. But whoso needs \n ' A pledge of safety, to whom life is sweet, \n ' Let him by fairer journey seek his lord. \n ' First be my foot upon the sand; on me \n ' First strike the burning sun; across my path \n ' The serpent void his venom; by my fate \n ' Know ye your perils. Let him only thirst \n ' Who sees me at the spring: who sees me seek \n ' The shade, alone sink fainting in the heat; \n ' Or whoso sees me ride before the ranks \n ' Plodding their weary march: such be the lot \n ' Of each, who, toiling, finds in me a chief \n ' And not a comrade. Snakes, thirst, burning sand \n 'The brave man welcomes, and the patient breast \n ' Finds happiness in labour. By its cost \n ' Courage is sweeter; and this Libyan land \n ' Such cloud of ills can furnish as might make \n 'Men flee unshamed.' 'Twas thus that Cato spake, \n Kindling the torch of valour and the love \n Of toil: then reckless of his fate he strode \n The desert path from which was no return: \n And Libya ruled his destinies, to shut \n His sacred name within a narrow tomb.\n \n \n One-third of all the world, if fame we trust, \n Is Libya ; yet by winds and sky she proves \n Equal to Europe ; for the shores of Nile \n \n No more than Scythian Tanais are remote \n From furthest Gades , where with bending coast, \n Yielding a place to Ocean, Europe parts \n From Afric shores. Yet falls the larger world \n To Asia only. From the former two \n Issues the Western wind; but Asia 's right \n Touches the Southern limits and her left \n The Northern tempest's home, and of the East \n She's mistress to the rising of the Sun. \n All that is fertile of the Afric lands \n Lies to the west, but even here abound \n No wells of water: though the Northern wind, \n Infrequent, leaving us with skies serene, \n Falls there in showers. Not gold nor wealth of brass \n It yields the seeker; pure and unalloyed \n Down to its lowest depths is Libyan soil. \n Yet citron forests to Maurusian tribes \n Were riches, had they known; but they, content, \n Lived 'neath the shady foliage, till gleamed \n The axe of Rome amid the virgin grove, \n To bring from furthest limits of the world \n Our banquet tables and the fruit they bear. \n \n But suns excessive and a scorching clime \n Burn all the glebe beside the shifting sands: \n There die the harvests on the crumbling mould; \n No root finds sustenance, nor kindly Jove \n Makes rich the furrow nor matures the vine. \n Sleep binds all nature and the tract of sand \n Lies ever fruitless, save that by the coast \n The hardy Nasamon plucks a scanty grass. \n Unclothed their race, and living on the woes \n Worked by the cruel Syrtes on the world. \n He dwells a spoiler by the sandy waves, \n And while no ships unlade upon his shore, \n Grows rich by wrecks-his only trade with man. \n By such a path at hardy Cato's word \n His soldiers passed, in thought from winds secure \n Nor dreading storms: but fearful was their lot \n More than on ocean waves; for Auster's force \n Here strikes with greater strength upon the sands, \n And yet more fraught with mischief: neither crags \n Repelled his strength, nor lofty mountains tamed \n His furious onset, nor in sturdy woods \n He found a bar; but free from curb he raged \n O'er the defenceless earth. Nor merely dust \n Swirled up in drifts of rain, but Earth herself, \n In major part, was rapt into the air \n On ceaseless whirlwinds borne, until amazed \n The Nasamon saw his scanty field and home \n Reft by the tempest, and the native huts \n From roof to base were hurried on the blast. \n Not higher, when some all-devouring flame \n Has seized upon its prey, in volumes dense \n Rolls up the smoke, and darkens all the air. \n Then with fresh might he fell upon the host \n Of marching Romans, snatching from their feet \n The sand they trod. Had Auster been enclosed \n In some vast cavernous vault with solid walls \n And mighty barriers, he had moved the world \n Upon its ancient base and made the lands \n To tremble: but the facile Libyan soil \n By not resisting stood, and blasts that whirled \n The surface upwards left the depths unmoved. \n Helmet and shield and spear were torn away \n By his most violent breath, and borne aloft \n Through all the regions of the boundless sky; \n Perchance a wonder in some distant land, \n Where men may fear the weapons from the heaven \n There falling, as the armour of the gods, \n Nor deem them ravished from a soldier's arm. \n 'Twas thus on Numa by the sacred fire \n Those shields descended which our chosen priests \n \n Bear on their shoulders; from some warlike race \n By tempest rapt, to be the prize of Rome . \n While thus the tempest whirled the earth aloft \n Prone fell the host, and wound their garments tight, \n And gripped the soil; but hardly thus prevailed. \n Weight had not held them safe; the raging blast \n Piles heaps upon them, their recumbent limbs \n Are whelmed in sand. At length they struggling rose \n Back to their feet, when lo! around them stood, \n Forced by the storm, a growing bank of earth \n Which held them motionless. And from afar \n Where walls lay prostrate, mighty stones were hurled, \n Thus piling ills on ills in wondrous form: \n No dwellings had they seen, yet at their feet \n Beheld the ruins. All the earth was hid \n In vast envelopment, nor found they guide \n Save from the stars, which as in middle deep \n Flamed o'er them wandering: yet some were hid \n Beneath the circle of the Libyan earth \n Which tending downwards hid the Northern sky. \n When warmth dispersed the tempest-driven air, \n And rose upon the earth the flaming day, \n Bathed were their limbs in sweat, but parched and dry \n Their gaping lips; when to a scanty spring \n Far off beheld they came, whose meagre drops \n All gathered in the hollow of a helm \n They offered to their chief. Caked were their throats \n With dust, and panting; and one little drop \n Had made him envied. 'Wretch, and dost thou deem \n Me wanting in a brave man's heart? ' he cried, \n ' Me only in this throng? And have I seemed \n 'Tender, unfit to bear the morning heat? \n He who would quench his thirst 'mid such a host, \n 'Doth most deserve its pangs.' Then in his wrath \n Dashed down the helmet, and the scanty spring, \n Thus by their leader spurned, sufficed for all.\n \n \n Now had they reached that temple which possess, \n Sole in all Libya , th' untutored tribes \n Of Garamantians. Here holds his seat \n (So saith the story) a prophetic Jove, \n Wielding no thunderbolts, nor like to ours; \n The Libyan Hammon of the curved horn. \n No wealth adorns his fane by Afric tribes \n Bestowed, nor glittering hoard of Eastern gems. \n Though rich Arabians, Ind and Ethiop \n Know him alone as Jove, still he is poor \n Holding his shrine by riches undefiled \n Through time; and pure as gods of olden days \n He spurns the wealth of Rome . That here sone god \n Dwells, witnesses the only grove \n That buds in Libya-for that which grows \n Upon the arid dust which Leptis parts \n From Berenice , knows no leaves; alone \n Hammon uprears a wood; a fount the cause \n Which with its waters binds the crumbling soil. \n Yet shall the Sun when poised upon the height \n Strike through the foliage: hardly can the tree \n Protect its trunk, and to a little space \n His rays draw in the circle of the shade. \n Here have men found the spot where that high band \n Solstitial divides in middle sky \n \n The zodiac stars: not here oblique their course, \n Nor Scorpion rises straighter than the Bull, \n Nor to the Scales does Ram give back his hours, \n Nor does Astraea bid the Fishes sink \n More slowly down: but watery Capricorn \n Is equal with the Crab, and with the Twins \n The Archer; neither does the Lion rise \n Above Aquarius. But the race that dwells \n Beyond the fervour of the Libyan fires \n Sees to the South that shadow which with us \n Falls to the North : slow Cynosura sinks \n \n For them below the deep; and, dry with us, \n The Wagon plunges; far from either pole, \n No star they know that does not seek the nain, \n But all the constellations in their course \n Whirl to their vision through the middle sky. \n Before the doors the Eastern peoples stood \n Seeking from horned Jove to know their fates: \n Yet to the Roman chief they yielded place, \n Whose comrades prayed him to entreat the gods \n Famed through the Libyan world, and judge the voice \n Renowned from distant ages. First of these \n Was Labienus: 'Chance,' he said, 'to us \n 'The voice and counsel of this mighty god \n 'Has offered as we march; from such a guide \n 'To know the issues of the war, and learn \n 'To track the Syrtes. For to whom on earth \n 'If not to blameless Cato , shall the gods \n Entrust their secret truths? Thou at the least \n 'Their faithful follower through life hast been. \n 'Lo! thou hast liberty to speak with Jove. \n Ask impious Caesar's fates, and learn the laws \n 'That wait our country in the future days: \n 'Whether the people shall be free to use \n 'Their rights and customs, or the civil war \n 'For us is wasted. To thy sacred breast, \n 'Lover of virtue, take the voice divine; \n 'Demand what virtue is and guide thy steps \n 'By heaven's high counsellor.' \n But Cato, full \n Of godlike thoughts borne in his quiet breast, \n This answer uttered, worthy of the shrines: \n 'What, Labienus, dost thou bid me ask? \n 'Whether in arms and freedom I should wish \n ' To perish, rather than endure a king? \n ' Is longest life worth aught? And doth its term \n ' Make difference? Can violence to the good \n Do injury? Do Fortune's threats avail \n Outweighed by virtue? Doth it not suffice \n To aim at deeds of bravery? Can fame \n Grow by achievement? Nay! No Hammon's voice \n Shall teach us this more surely than we know. \n Bound are we to the gods; no voice we need; \n They live in all our acts, although the shrine \n Be silent: at our birth and once for all \n What may be known the author of our being \n Revealed; nor chose these thirsty sands to chaunt \n 'To few his truth, whelmed in the dusty waste. \n God has his dwelling in all things that be, \n \n In earth and air and sea and starry vault, \n In virtuous deeds; in all that thou canst see, \n In all thy thoughts contained. Why further, then, \n Seek we our deities? Let those who doubt \n And halting, tremble for their coming fates, \n Go ask the oracles. No mystic words, \n Make sure my heart, but surely coming Death. \n \" Coward alike and brave, we all must die. \n Thus hath Jove spoken : seek to know no more.' \n Thus Cato spoke, and faithful to his creed \n He parted from the temple of the god \n And left the oracle of Hammon dumb. \n Bearing his javelin, as one of them \n He strode afoot before the panting troops: \n No bending neck, no litter bore his form. \n He bade them not, but showed them how to toil. \n Spare in his sleep, the last to sip the spring, \n When at some rivulet to quench their thirst \n The eager ranks pressed onward, he alone \n Until the humblest follower might drink \n Stood motionless. If for the truly good \n Is fame, and virtue by the deed itself, \n Not by successful issue, should be judged, \n Yield, famous ancestors! Fortune, not worth \n Gained you your glory. But such name as his \n Who ever merited by successful war \n Or slaughtered peoples? Rather would I lead \n With him his triumphs through the pathless sands \n And Libya 's bounds, than in Pompeius' car \n Three times ascend the Capitol, or break \n The proud Jugurtha. \n Rome ! in him behold \n His country's father, worthiest of thy vows; \n A name by which men shall not blush to swear, \n Whom, shouldst thou break the fetters from thy neck, \n Thou mayst in distant days decree divine. \n Now was the heat more dense, and through that clime \n Than which no further on the Southern side \n The gods permit, they trod; and scarcer still \n The water, till in middle sands they found \n One copious fountain; but its brimming wave \n Was thronged with serpents which it hardly held, \n And thirsty asps were pressing on the marge. \n But when the chieftain saw that speedy fate \n Was on the host, if they should leave the well \n Untasted, ' Vain,' he cried, your fear of death. \n ' Drink, nor delay: 'tis from the threatening tooth \n \" Men draw their deaths, and fatal from the fang \n ' Issues the juice if mingled with the blood; \n ' The cup is harmless.' Then he sipped the fount, \n Still doubting, and in all the Libyan waste \n There only was he first to touch the stream.\n \n \n Why fertile thus in death the pestilent air \n Of Libya , what poison in her soil \n Her several nature mixed, my care to know \n Has not availed: but from the days of old \n A fabled story has deceived the world. \n Far on her limits, where the burning shore \n Admits the ocean fervid from the sun \n Plunged in its waters, lay Medusa's fields \n Untilled; nor forests shaded, nor the plough \n Furrowed the soil, which by its mistress' gaze \n Was hardened into stone: Phorcus, her sire. \n Malevolent nature from her body first \n Drew forth these noisome pests; first from her jaws \n Issued the sibilant rattle of serpent tongues; \n Clustered around her head the poisonous brood \n Like to a woman's hair, wreathed on her neck \n Which gloried in their touch; their glittering heads \n Advanced towards her; and her tresses kempt \n Dripped down with viper's venom. This alone \n Thou hast, accursed one, which men can see \n Unharmed; for who upon that gaping mouth \n Looked and could dread? Whom suffered she to die \n Who saw her face? He rushed upon his fate \n And ere he feared was stricken to the death. \n Perished the limbs while living, and the soul \n Grew stiff and stark ere yet it fled the frame. \n Men have been frenzied by the Furies' locks, \n Not killed; and Cerberus at Orpheus' song \n Ceased from his hissing, and Alcides saw \n The Hydra ere he slew. This monster born \n Brought horror with her birth upon her sire \n Phorcus, in second order God of Waves, \n And upon Ceto and the Gorgon brood, \n \n Her sisters. She could treat the sea and sky \n With deadly calm unknown, and from the world \n Bid cease the soil. Borne down by instant weight \n Fowls fell from air, and beasts were fixed in stone. \n Whole Ethiop tribes who tilled the neighbouring lands \n Rigid in marble stood. The Gorgon sight \n No creature bore and even her serpents turned \n Back from her visage. Atlas in his place \n Beside the Western columns, by her look \n Was turned to granite; and when Phlegra's brood \n Gigantic, serpent-tailed, were feared of heaven, \n She made them mountains, and the Gorgon head \n Borne on Athena's bosom closed the war. \n Here born of Danae and the golden shower, \n Floating on wings Parrhasian, by the god \n Arcadian given, author of the lyre \n And wrestling art, came Perseus, swooping down \n From heaven. Cyllenian Harpe did he bear \n Still crimson from another monster slain, \n The guardian of the heifer loved by Jove. \n This to her winged brother Pallas lent \n Price of the monster's head: by her command \n He sought the limits of the Libyan land, \n Poised o'er Medusa's realm, with head averse \n Towards the rising sun: a burnished shield \n Of yellow brass upon his other arm, \n Her gift, her bore: in which she bade him see \n The fatal face unscathed. Nor yet in sleep \n Lay all the monster, for such total rest \n To her were death-so fated: serpent locks \n In vigilant watch, some reaching forth defend \n Her head, while others lay upon her face \n And slumbering eyes. Then hero Perseus shook \n Though turned averse; trembled his dexter hand: \n But Pallas held, and the descending blade \n Shore the broad neck whence sprang the viper brood. \n What visage bore the Gorgon as the steel \n Thus reft her life! what poison from her throat \n Breathed! from her eyes what venom of death distilled! \n The goddess dared not look, and Perseus' face \n Had frozen, averse, had not Athena veiled \n With coils of writhing snakes the features dead. \n Then with the Gorgon head the hero flew \n Uplifted on his wings and sought the sky. \n Shorter had been his voyage through the midst \n Of Europe 's cities; but Athena bade \n To spare her peoples and their fruitful lands; \n For who when such an airy courser passed \n Had not looked up to heaven? Western winds \n Now sped his pinions, and he took his course \n O'er Libya 's regions, from the stars and suns \n Veiled by no culture. Phoebus' nearer track \n There burns the soil, and loftiest on the sky \n \n There falls the night, to shade the wandering moon, \n If e'er forgetful of her course oblique, \n Straight through the stars, nor bending to the North \n Nor to the South, she hastens. Yet that earth, \n In nothing fertile, void of fruitful yield, \n Drank in the poison of Medusa's blood, \n Dripping in dreadful dews upon the soil, \n And in the crumbling sands by heat matured. \n Where first within the dust the venom germ \n \n Took life, an asp was reared of turgid neck \n And sleep compelling: thick the poison drop \n That was his making, in no fang of snake \n More closely pressed. Greedy of warmth it seeks \n No frozen world itself, nor haunts the sands \n Beyond the Nile ; yet has our thirst of gain \n No shame nor limit, and this Libyan death, \n This fatal pest we purchase for our own. \n Haemorrhois huge spreads out his scaly coils, \n Who suffers not his hapless victims' blood \n To stay within their veins. Chersydros sprang \n To life, to dwell within the doubtful marsh \n Where land nor sea prevails. A cloud of spray \n Marked fell Chelyder's track: and Cenchris rose \n Straight gliding to his prey, his belly tinged \n With various spots unnumbered, more than those \n Which paint the Theban marble; horned snakes \n With spines contorted: like to torrid sand \n Ammodytes, of hue invisible: \n Sole of all serpents Scytale to shed \n In vernal frosts his slough; and thirsty Dipsas; \n Dread Amphisbaena with his double head \n Tapering; and Natrix who in bubbling fount \n Fuses his venom. Greedy Prester swells \n His foaming jaws; Pareas, head erect \n Furrows with tail alone his sandy path; \n Swift Jaculus there, and Seps whose poisonous juice \n Makes liquid bone and flesh: and there upreared \n His regal head, and frighted from his track \n With sibilant terror all the subject swarm, \n Baneful ere darts his poison, Basilisk \n \n In sands deserted king. Ye serpents too \n Who in all other regions harmless glide \n Adored as gods, and bright with golden scales, \n Are deadly here: for Afric air inhaled \n Bestows malignant gift, as poised on wings \n Whole herds of kine ye follow, and with coils \n Encircling close, crush in the mighty bull. \n Nor does the elephant in his giant bulk, \n Nor aught, find safety; and ye need no fang \n Nor poison, to compel the fatal end.\n \n \n Amid these pests undaunted Cato urged \n His desert journey on. His hardy troops \n Beneath his eyes, pricked by a scanty wound, \n In strangest forms of death unnumbered fall. \n Tyrrhenian Aulus, bearer of a flag, \n Trod on a Dipsas; quick with head reversed \n The serpent struck; no mark betrayed the tooth: \n The aspect of the wound nor threatened death, \n Nor any evil; but the poison germ \n In silence working as consuming fire \n Absorbed the moisture of his inward frame, \n Draining the natural juices that were spread \n Around his vitals; in his arid jaws \n Set flame upon his tongue: his wearied limbs \n No sweat bedewed; dried up, the fount of tears \n Fled from his eyelids. Tortured by the fire \n Nor Cato's sternness, nor of his sacred charge \n The honour could withhold him; but he dared \n To dash his standard down, and through the plains \n Raging, to seek for water that might slake \n The fatal venom thirsting at his heart. \n Plunge him in Tanais , in Rhone and Po, \n Pour on his burning tongue the flood of Nile , \n Yet were the fire unquenched. So fell the fang \n Of Dipsas in the torrid Libyan lands; \n In other climes less fatal. Next he seeks \n Amid the sands, all barren to the depths, \n For moisture: then returning to the shoals \n Laps them with greed-in vain-the briny draught \n Scarce quenched the thirst it made. Nor knowing yet \n The poison in his frame, he steels himself \n To rip his swollen veins and drink the gore. \n Cato bids lift the standard, lest his troops \n May find in thirst a pardon for the deed. \n But on Sabellus' yet more piteous death \n Their eyes were fastened. Clinging to his skin \n A Seps with curving tooth, of little size, \n He seized and tore away, and to the sands \n Pierced with his javelin. Small the serpent's bulk; \n None deals a death more horrible in form. \n For swift the flesh dissolving round the wound \n Bared the pale bone; swam all his limbs in blood; \n Wasted the tissue of his calves and knees: \n And all the muscles of his thighs were thawed \n In black distilment, and the membrane sheath \n Parted, that bound his vitals, which abroad \n Flowed upon earth: yet seemed it not that all \n His frame was loosed, for by the venomous drop \n Were all the bands that held his muscles drawn \n Down to a juice; the framework of his chest \n Was bare, its cavity, and all the parts \n Hid by the organs of life, that make the man. \n So by unholy death there stood revealed \n His inmost nature. Head and stalwart arms, \n And neck and shoulders, from their solid mass \n Melt in corruption. Not more swiftly flows \n Wax at the sun's command, nor snow compelled \n By southern breezes. Yet not all is said: \n For so to noxious humours fire consumes \n Our fleshly frame; but on the funeral pyre \n What bones have perished? These dissolve no less \n Than did the mouldered tissues, nor of death \n Thus swift is left a trace. Of Afric pests \n Thou bear'st the palm for hurtfulness: the life \n They snatch away, thou only with the life \n The clay that held it. \n Lo! a different fate, \n Not this by melting! for a Prester's fang \n Nasidius struck, who erst in Marsian fields \n Guided the plough. Upon his face there burns \n A redness as of flame: swollen the skin, \n His features hidden, swollen all his limbs \n Till more than human: and his definite frame \n One tumour huge conceals. A ghastly gore \n Is puffed from inwards as the virulent juice \n Courses through all his body; which, thus grown, \n His corselet holds not. Not in caldron so \n Boils up to mountainous height the steaming wave; \n Nor in such bellying curves does canvas bend \n To Eastern tempests. Now the ponderous bulk \n Rejects the limbs, and as a shapeless trunk \n Burdens the earth: and there, to beasts and birds \n A fatal feast, his comrades leave the corse; \n Nor dare to place, yet swelling, in the tomb. \n But for their eyes the Libyan pests prepared \n More dreadful sights. On Tullus great in heart, \n And bound to Cato with admiring soul, \n A fierce Haemorrhois fixed. From every limb, \n \n (As from a statue saffron spray is showered \n In every part) there spouted forth for blood \n A sable poison: from the natural pores \n Of moisture, gore profuse; his mouth was filled \n And gaping nostrils, and his tears were blood. \n Brimmed full his veins; his very sweat was red; \n All was one wound. \n Then piteous Levus next \n In sleep was victim, for around his heart \n Stood still the blood congealed: no pain he felt \n Of venomous tooth, but swift upon him fell \n Death, and he sought the shades; more swift to kill \n No draught in poisonous cups from ripened plants \n Of direst growth Sabaean wizards brew. \n Lo! Upon branchless trunk a serpent, named \n By Libyans Jaculus, rose in coils to dart \n His venom from afar. Through Paullus' brain \n It rushed, nor stayed; for in the wound itself \n Was death. Then did they know how slowly flies, \n Flung from a sling, the stone; how gently speed \n Through air the shafts of Scythia . What availed, \n Murrus, the lance by which thou didst transfix \n A Basilisk? Swift through the weapon ran \n The poison to his hand: he drew his sword \n And severed arm and shoulder at a blow: \n Then gazed secure upon his severed hand \n Which perished as he looked. So hadst thou died, \n And such had been thy fate! \n Whoe'er had thought \n A scorpion had strength o'er death and fate? \n Yet with his threatening coils and barb erect \n He won the glory of Orion slain; \n So bear the stars their witness. And who would fear \n Thy haunts, Salpuga? Yet the Stygian Maids \n Have given thee power to snap the fatal threads.\n \n \n Thus nor the day with brightness, nor the night \n With darkness gave them peace. The very earth \n On which they lay they feared; nor leaves nor straw \n They piled for couches, but upon the ground \n Unshielded from the fates they laid their limbs, \n Cherished beneath whose warmth in chill of night \n The frozen pests found shelter; in whose jaws \n Harmless the while, the lurking venom slept. \n Nor did they know the measure of their march \n Accomplished, nor their path; the stars in heaven \n Their only guide. ' Return, ye gods,' they cried, \n In frequent wail, ' the arms from which we fled. \n ' Give back Thessalia . Sworn to meet the sword \n ' Why, lingering, fall we thus? In Caesar's place \n ' The thirsty Dipsas and the horned snake \n ' Now wage the warfare. Rather let us seek \n ' That region by the horses of the sun \n ' Scorched, and the zone most torrid: let us fall \n 'Slain by some heavenly cause, and from the sky \n ' Descend our fate! Not, Africa , of thee \n ' Complain we, nor of Nature. From mankind \n ' Cut off, this quarter, teeming thus with pests \n ' She gave to snakes, and to the barren fields \n ' Denied the husbandman, nor wished that men \n 'Should perish by their venom. To the realms \n ' Of serpents have we come. Hater of men, \n ' Receive thy vengeance, whoso of the gods \n ' Severed this region upon either hand, \n ' With death in middle space. Our march is set \n 'Through thy sequestered kingdom, and the host \n ' Which knows thy secret seeks the furthest world. \n ' Perchance some greater wonders on our path \n ' May still await us; in the waves be plunged \n ' Heaven's constellations, and the lofty pole \n 'Stoop from its height. By further space removed \n ' No land, than Juba's realm; by rumour's voice \n ' Drear, mournful. Haply for this serpent land \n ' There may we long, where yet some living thing \n ' Gives consolation. Not my native land \n ' Nor European fields I hope for now \n ' Lit by far other suns, nor Asia 's plains. \n ' But in what land, what region of the sky, \n ' Where left we Africa ? But now with frosts \n ' Cyrene stiffened: have we changed the laws \n ' Which rule the seasons, in this little space? \n ' Cast from the world we know, 'neath other skies \n ' And stars we tread; behind our backs the home \n ' Of southern tempests: Rome herself perchance \n ' Now lies beneath our feet. Yet for our fates \n ' This solace pray we, that on this our track \n ' Pursuing Caesar with his host may come.' \n Thus was their stubborn patience of its plaints \n Disburdened. But the bravery of their chief \n Forced them to bear their toils. Upon the sand, \n All bare, he lies and dares at every hour \n Fortune to strike: he only at the fate \n Of each was present, flew to every call; \n And roused their hearts to fight the poison germ. \n Not life he brings them, but the strength in death \n To die without a groan-to groan were shame \n When he was witness-over him what power \n Had plague or venom? In a comrade's breast \n They see him conquer anguish; and they learn, \n Gazing on him, how weak the power of pain. \n Some aid from Fortune, weary of their woes, \n At length they gained. Of all who till the earth \n The Psyllians only are by snakes unharmed. \n Potent as herbs their song; safe is their blood, \n Nor gives admission to the poison germ \n E'en when the chant has ceased. Their home itself \n Placed in such venomous tract and serpent-thronged \n Gained them this vantage, and a truce with death, \n Else could they not have lived. Such is their trust \n In purity of blood, that newly born \n Each babe they prove by test of deadly asp \n For foreign lineage. So the bird of Jove \n Turns his new fledglings to the rising sun \n And such as gaze upon the beams of day \n With eyes unwavering, for the use of heaven \n He rears; but such as blink at Phoebus' rays \n Casts from the nest. Thus of unmixed descent \n The babe who, dreading not the serpent touch, \n Plays in his cradle with the deadly snake. \n Nor with their own immunity from harm \n Contented do they rest, but watch for guests \n Who need their help against the noisome plague. \n Now to the Roman standards are they come, \n And when the chieftain bade the tents be fixed, \n First all the sandy space within the lines \n With song they purify and magic words \n From which all serpents flee: next round the camp \n In widest circuit from a kindled fire \n Rise aromatic odours: danewort burns, \n And juice distils from Syrian galbanum; \n Then mournful tamarisk, costum from the East, \n Strong panacea mixed with centaury \n From Thrace , and leaves of fennel feed the flames, \n And thapsus brought from Eryx : and they burn \n Larch, southern-wood and antlers of a deer \n Which lived afar. From these in densest fumes, \n Deadly to snakes, a pungent smoke arose; \n And thus in safety passed the night away. \n But should some victim feel the fatal fang \n Upon the march, then of this magic race \n Were seen the wonders; with saliva first \n They smear the limb, whose silent working keeps \n \n The venom in the wound. From foaming mouth \n Next with continuous cadence would they pour \n Unceasing chants-nor breathing space nor pause- \n Else spreads the poison: nor does fate permit \n A moment's silence. Oft from the black flesh \n Flies forth the pest beneath the magic song: \n But should it linger nor obey the voice, \n Repugnant to the summons, on the wound \n Prostrate they lay their lips and from the depths \n Now paling draw the venom. In their mouths, \n Sucked from the freezing flesh, they hold the death, \n Then spew it forth; and from the taste shall know \n The nature of the snake whose bite they cure.\n \n \n Thus helped, the Roman host with lighter heart \n Trod through the barren fields in lengthy march. \n \n Twice veiled the moon her light and twice renewed; \n Yet still, with waning or with growing orb \n Saw Cato's steps upon the sandy waste. \n But more and more beneath their feet the dust \n Began to harden, till the Libyan tracts \n Once more were earth, and in the distance rose \n Some groves of scanty foliage, and huts \n Of plastered straw unfashioned: and their hearts \n Leaped at the prospect of a better land. \n How fled their sorrow! how with growing joy \n They met the savage lion in the path! \n In tranquil Leptis first they found retreat: \n And passed a winter free from heat and rain. \n \n When Caesar sated with Emathia 's slain \n Forsook the battlefield, all other cares \n Neglected, he pursued his kinsman fled, \n On him alone intent: by land his steps \n He traced in vain; then, rumour for his guide, \n He crossed the sea and reached the Thracian strait \n For love renowned; where on the mournful shore \n Rose Hero's tower, and Helle born of cloud \n Took from the rolling waves their former name. \n Nowhere with shorter space the sea divides \n \n Europe from Asia ; though Pontus parts \n By scant division from Byzantium 's hold \n \n Chalcedon oyster-rich: and small the strait \n Through which Propontis pours the Euxine wave. \n Then marvelling at their ancient fame, he seeks \n Sigeum's sandy beach and Simois' stream, \n Rhoeteum noble for its Grecian tomb, \n And all the heroes' shades, the theme of song. \n Next by the town of Troy burnt down of old \n Now but a memorable name, he turns \n His steps, and searches for the mighty stones \n Relics of Phoebus' wall. But bare with age \n Forests of trees and mouldering trunks oppressed \n Assaracus' palace, and with wearied roots \n Possessed the ancient temples of the gods. \n All Pergamus with densest brake was veiled \n And even her stones were perished. He beheld \n Thy rock, Hesione; the hidden grove, \n Anchises' nuptial chamber; and the cave \n Where sat the arbiter; the spot from which \n Was snatched the beauteous youth; the mountain lawn \n Where mourned OEnone. Not a stone but told \n The story of the past. A little stream \n Scarce trickling through the arid plain he passed, \n Nor knew 'twas Xanthus : deep in grass he placed, \n Careless, his footstep; but the herdsman cried \n Thou tread'st the dust of Hector.' Stones confused \n Lay at his feet in sacred shape no more: \n 'Look on the altar of Jove,' thus spake the guide, \n God of the household, guardian of the home.' \n O sacred task of poets, toil supreme, \n Which rescuing all things from allotted fate \n Dost give eternity to mortal men! \n Grudge not the glory, Caesar, of such fame. \n For if the Latian Muse may promise aught, \n Long as the heroes of the Trojan time \n Shall live upon the page of Smyrna 's bard, \n So long shall future races read of thee \n In this my poem; and Pharsalia's song \n Live unforgotten in the age to come. \n When by the ancient grandeur of the place \n The chieftain's sight was filled, of gathered turf \n Altars he raised: and as the sacred flame \n Cast forth its odours, these not idle vows \n Gave to the gods, 'Ye deities of the dead, \n ' Who watch o'er Phrygian ruins: ye who now \n Lavinia's homes inhabit, and Alba's height: \n Gods of my sire AEneas, in whose fanes \n The Trojan fire still burns: pledge of the past \n 'Mysterious Pallas, of the inmost shrine, \n Unseen of men! here in your ancient seat, \n 'Most famous offspring of Iulus' race, \n 'I call upon you and with pious hand \n Burn frequent offerings. To my emprise \n Give prosperous ending! Here shall I replace \n 'The Phrygian peoples, here in glad return \n ' Italia 's sons shall build a Pergamus \n \n And from these stones shall rise a Roman Troy.' \n He seeks his fleet, and eager to regain \n Time spent at Ilium , to the favouring breeze \n Spreads all his canvas. Past rich Asia borne, \n \n Rhodes soon he left while foamed the sparkling main \n Beneath his keels; nor ceased the wind to stretch \n His bending sails, till on the seventh night \n The Pharian beam proclaimed Egyptian shores. \n But day arose, and veiled the nightly lamp \n Ere rode his barks on waters safe from storm. \n Then Caesar saw that tumult held the shore, \n And mingled voices of uncertain sound \n Struck on his ear: and trusting not himself \n To doubtful kingdoms, of uncertain troth, \n He kept his ships from land. But from the king \n Came his vile minion forth upon the wave, \n Bearing his dreadful gift, Pompeius' head, \n Wrapped in a covering of Pharian wool. \n First took he speech and thus in shameless words \n Commends the murder: ' Conqueror of the world, \n First of the Roman race, and, what as yet \n Thou dost not know, safe by thy kinsman slain; \n This gift receive from the Pellaean king, \n Sole trophy absent from the Thracian field, \n 'To crown thy toils on land and on the deep. \n Here in thine absence have we placed for thee \n 'An end upon the war. Here Magnus came \n To mend his fallen fortunes; on our swords \n 'Here met his death. With such a pledge of faith \n Here have we bought thee, Caesar; with his blood \n Seal we this treaty. Take the Pharian realm \n Sought by no bloodshed, take the rule of Nile , \n Take all that thou wouldst give for Magnus' life: \n And hold him vassal worthy of thy camp \n 'To whom the fates against thy son-in-law \n 'Such power entrusted; nor hold thou the deed \n 'Lightly accomplished by the swordsman's stroke, \n And so the merit. Guest ancestral he \n Who was its victim; who, his sire expelled, \n ' Gave back to him the sceptre. For a deed \n ' So great, thou'lt find a name-or ask the world. \n ' If 'twas a crime, thou must confess the debt \n 'To us the greater, for that from thy hand \n ' We took the doing.' \n Then he held and showed \n Unveiled the head. Now had the hand of death \n Passed with its changing touch upon the face: \n Nor at first sight did Caesar on the gift \n Pass condemnation; nor avert his gaze, \n But dwelt upon the features till he knew \n The crime accomplished. Then when truth was sure \n The loving father rose, and tears he shed \n Which flowed at his command, and glad in heart \n Forced from his breast a groan : thus by the flow \n Of feigned tears and grief he hoped to hide \n His joy else manifest: and the ghastly boon \n Sent by the king disparaging, professed \n Rather to mourn his son's dissevered head, \n Than count it for a debt. For thee alone, \n Magnus, he durst not fail to find a tear: \n He, Caesar, who with mien unaltered spurned \n The Roman Senate, and with eyes undimmed \n Looked on Pharsalia's field. O fate most hard! \n Didst thou with impious war pursue the man \n Whom 'twas thy lot to mourn? No kindred ties, \n No memory of thy daughter and her son \n Touch on thy heart? Didst think perchance that grief \n Might help thy cause 'mid lovers of his name? \n Or haply, moved by envy of the king, \n Griev'st that to other hands than thine was given \n To shed the captive's life-blood? and complain'st \n Thy vengeance perished and the conquered chief \n Snatched from thy haughty hand? Whate'er the cause \n That urged thy grief, 'twas far removed from love. \n Was this forsooth the object of thy toil \n O'er lands and oceans, that without thy ken \n He should not perish? Nay! but well was reft \n From thine arbitrament his fate. What crime \n Did cruel Fortune spare, what depth of shame \n To Roman honour! since she suffered not, \n Perfidious traitor, while yet Magnus lived, \n That thou shouldst pity him! \n Thus by words he dared \n To gain their credence in his sembled grief: \n Hence from my sight with his detested gift, \n Thou minion, to thy king. Worse does your crime \n Deserve from Caesar than from Magnus' hands. \n The only prize that civil war affords \n Thus have we lost-to bid the conquered live. \n If but the sister of this Pharian king \n Were not by him detested, by the head \n Of Cleopatra had I paid this gift. \n Such were the fit return. Why did he draw \n His separate sword, and in the toil that's ours \n Mingle his weapons? In Thessalia's field \n Gave we such right to the Pellaean blade? \n Such licence did your mutual kingdom gain? \n Magnus as partner in the rule of Rome \n \n I had not brooked; and shall I tolerate \n Thee, Ptolemaeus? In vain with civil wars \n Thus have we roused the nations, if there be \n Now any might but Caesar's, if any land \n Yet owns you masters. From your shore I'd turn \n The prows of Latium ; but fame forbids, \n Lest men should whisper that I did not damn \n This deed of blood, but feared the Pharian land. \n Nor think ye to deceive; victorious here \n I stand: else had my welcome at your hands \n Been that of Magnus; and that neck were mine \n But for Pharsalia's chance. At greater risk \n So seems it, than we dreamed of, took we arms; \n Exile, and Magnus' threats, and Rome I knew, \n Not Ptolemaeus. But we spare the boy: \n Pass by the murder. Let the princeling know \n We give no more than pardon for his crime. \n And now in honour of the mighty dead, \n Not merely that the earth may hide your guilt, \n Lay ye the chieftain's head within the tomb; \n ' With proper sepulture appease his shade \n 'And place his scattered ashes in an urn. \n Thus may he know my coming, and may hear \n Affection's accents, and my fond complaints. \n Me sought he not, but rather, for his life, \n This Pharian vassal; snatching from mankind \n The happy morning which had shown the world \n A peace between us. But my prayers to heaven \n No favouring answer found; that arms laid down \n 'In happy victory, Magnus, once again \n I might embrace thee, begging thee to grant \n 'Thine ancient love to Caesar, and thy life. \n 'Thus for my labours with a worthy prize \n 'Content, thine equal, bound in faithful peace, \n 'I might have brought thee to forgive the gods \n 'For thy disaster; thou hadst gained for me \n 'From Rome forgiveness.' \n Thus he spake, but found \n No comrade in his tears; nor did the host \n Give credit to his grief. Deep in their breasts \n They hide their groans, and gaze with joyful front \n (O famous Freedom! ) on the deed of blood: \n And dare to laugh when mighty Caesar wept.\n \n "

        "9":{
            "0":"\n WHEN Caesar, following those who bore the head, \n First trod the shore accursed, with Egypt 's fates \n His fortunes battled, whether Rome should pass \n In crimson conquest o'er the guilty land, \n Or Memphis ' arms should ravish from the world \n Victor and vanquished: and the warning shade \n Of Magnus saved his kinsman from the sword. \n By that dread crime assured, his standards borne \n Before, he marched upon the Pharian town; \n But when the people, jealous of their laws, \n Murmured against the fasces, Caesar knew \n Their minds were adverse, and that not for him \n Was Magnus' murder wrought. And yet with brow \n Dissembling fear, intrepid, through the shrines \n Of Egypt 's gods he strode, and round the fane \n Of ancient Isis; bearing witness all \n To Macedon 's vigour in the days of old. \n Yet did nor gold nor ornament restrain \n His hasting steps, nor worship of the gods, \n Nor city ramparts: but in greed of gain \n He sought the cave dug out amid the tombs. \n \n The madman offspring there of Philip lies, \n The famed Pellaean robber, Fortune's friend, \n Snatched off by fate, in vengeance for the world. \n In sacred sepulchre the hero's limbs, \n Which should be scattered o'er the earth, repose, \n Still spared by Fortune to these tyrant days: \n For in a world to freedom once recalled, \n All men had mocked the dust of him who set \n The baneful lesson that so many lands \n Can serve one master. Macedon he left \n His home obscure; Athena he despised, \n The conquest of his sire, and spurred by fate \n Through Asia rushed with havoc of mankind, \n Plunging his sword through peoples; red with blood \n Unknown to them Euphrates , Ganges ran. \n Curse of all earth, fell star of evil fate \n To every nation! On the outer sea \n He launched his fleet to sail the ocean wave: \n Nor flame nor flood nor sterile Libyan sands \n Stayed back his course, nor Hammon's pathless shoals; \n Far to the west, where downward slopes the world \n He would have led his armies, and the poles \n Had compassed, and had drunk the fount of Nile : \n But came his latest day; such end alone \n Could nature place upon the madman king, \n Who jealous in death as when he won the world \n His empire with him took, nor left an heir. \n Thus every city to the spoiler's hand \n Was victim made. Yet in his fall was his \n \n Babylon ; and Parthia feared him. Shame on us \n That Eastern nations dreaded more the lance \n Of Macedon than now the Roman spear. \n True that we rule beyond where takes its rise \n The burning southern breeze, beyond the homes \n Of western winds, and to the northern star; \n But towards the rising of the sun, we yield \n To him who kept the Arsacids in awe; \n And puny Pella held as province sure \n The Parthia fatal to our Roman arms. \n Now from the stream Pelusian of the Nile , \n Was come the boyish king, taming the rage \n Of his effeminate people: pledge of peace; \n And Caesar safely trod Pellean halls; \n When Cleopatra bribed her guard to break \n The harbour chains, and borne in little boat \n Within the Macedonian palace gates, \n Caesar unknowing, entered: Egypt 's shame; \n Fury of Latium ; to the bane of Rome \n \n Unchaste. For as the Spartan queen of yore \n By fatal beauty Argos urged to strife \n And Ilium 's homes, so Cleopatra roused \n \n Italia 's frenzy. By her drum she called \n Down on the Capitol terror (if to speak \n Such word be lawful); mixed with Roman arms \n Coward Canopus , hoping she might lead \n A Pharian triumph, Caesar in her train; \n And 'twas in doubt upon Leucadian waves \n Whether a woman, not of Roman blood, \n Should hold the world in awe. Such lofty thoughts \n Seized on her soul upon that night in which \n The wanton daughter of Pellean kings \n First shared our leaders' couches. Who shall blame \n Antonius for the madness of his love, \n When Caesar's haughty breast drew in the flame? \n Who red with carnage, 'mid the clash of arms, \n In palace haunted by Pompeius' shade, \n Gave place to love; and in adulterous bed, \n Magnus forgotten, from the Queen impure, \n To Julia gave a brother: on the bounds \n Of furthest Libya permitting thus \n His foe to gather: while in dalliance base \n He waited on his mistress, and to her \n Pharos would give; for her would conquer all. \n Then Cleopatra, trusting to her charms, \n Tearless approached him, though in form of grief; \n Her tresses loose as though in sorrow torn, \n So best becoming her; and thus began: \n 'If, mighty Caesar, aught to noble birth \n ' Be due, give ear. Of Lagian race am I \n ' Offspring illustrious; from my father's throne \n 'Cast forth to banishment; unless thy hand \n 'Restore to me the sceptre: then a Queen \n ' Falls at thy feet embracing. To our race \n ' Bright star of justice thou Nor first shall I \n ' As woman rule the cities of the Nile ; \n ' For, neither sex preferring, Pharos bows \n 'To queenly governance. Of my parted sire \n ' Read the last words, by which 'tis mine to share \n ' With equal rights the kingdom and the bed. \n 'And the boy loves his sister, were he free; \n ' But his affections and his sword alike \n ' Pothinus orders. Nor wish I myself \n ' To wield my father's power; but this my prayer: \n ' Save from this foul disgrace our royal house, \n ' Bid that the king shall reign, and from the court \n 'Remove this hateful varlet, and his arms. \n 'How swells his bosom for that his the hand \n 'That shore Pompeius' head! And now he threats \n Thee, Caesar, also; which the Fates avert! \n Shame on the earth and thee that Magnus' death \n Should be Pothinus' triumph or his guilt.' \n Her words were nothing to his stubborn ear; \n Her face achieved the prayer, her wanton smile, \n The long voluptuous night of shame untold: \n So did she bribe her judge; so Caesar fell.\n \n \n When she had purchased at so vast a price \n Peace from the chief, the joys of such a peace \n A feast proclaimed. There in full pomp the Queen \n Displayed her luxuries, as yet unknown \n To Roman manners. Spacious rose the hall \n Like to such fane as this corrupted age \n Shall scarcely rear: the lofty ceiling shone \n With richest tracery, the beams were bound \n In golden coverings; no scant veneer \n Lay on its walls, but built in solid blocks \n Of marble, gleamed the palace. Agate stood \n In sturdy columns, bearing up the roof; \n Onyx and porphyry on the spacious floor \n Were trodden 'neath the foot; the mighty gates \n Of Maroe's ebony throughout were formed, \n No mere adornment; ivory clothed the hall, \n Studded with emerald spots; upon the doors \n Gleamed polished tortoise shells from Indian seas: \n And gems of price and yellow jasper shone \n On couch and coverlet, whose greater part \n Dipped more than once within the vats of Tyre \n \n Had drunk their juice; and part were feathered gold; \n Part crimson dyed, in manner as are passed \n Through Pharian leash the threads. There waited slaves \n In number as a people, some in ranks \n By different blood distinguished, some by age; \n This band with Libyan, that with auburn hair \n Red so that Caesar on the banks of Rhine \n \n None such had witnessed; some with features scorched \n By torrid suns, their locks in twisted coils \n Drawn from their foreheads. Eunuchs too were there, \n Unhappy race; and on the other side \n Men of full age whose cheeks with growth of hair \n Were hardly darkened. \n Upon either hand \n Lay kings, and Caesar in the midst supreme. \n There in her fatal beauty lay the Queen \n Thick daubed with unguents, nor with throne content \n Nor with her brother spouse; laden she lay \n On neck and hair with all the Red Sea spoils, \n And faint beneath the weight of gems and gold. \n Her snowy breast shone through Sidonian lawn \n Which woven close by shuttles of the East \n The art of Nile had loosened. Ivory feet \n Bore citron tables brought from woods that wave \n \n On Atlas, such as Caesar never saw \n When Juba was his captive. Blind in soul \n By madness of ambition, thus to fire \n By such profusion of her wealth, the mind \n Of Caesar armed, her guest in civil war! \n Not though he aimed with pitiless hand to grasp \n The riches of a world; not though were here \n Those ancient leaders of the simple age, \n Fabricius or Curius stern of soul, \n Or he who, Consul, left in sordid garb \n His Tuscan plough, could all their several hopes \n Have risen to such spoil. On plates of gold \n They piled the banquet sought in earth and air \n And from the deepest seas and Nilus' waves, \n Through all the world; in craving for display, \n No hunger urging. Frequent birds and beasts, \n \n Egypt 's high gods, they placed upon the board: \n In crystal goblets water of the Nile \n \n They handed, and in massive cups of price \n Was poured the wine; no juice of Mareot grape, \n \n But noble vintage of Falernian growth \n Which seasons few in Meroe 's famous vats \n Had mellowed as with age. Upon their brows \n Chaplets were placed of roses ever young \n With glistening nard entwined; and in their locks \n Was cinnamon infused, not yet in air \n Its fragrance perished, nor in foreign climes; \n And rich amomum from the neighbouring fields. \n Thus Caesar learned the booty of a world \n To lavish, and his breast was shamed of war \n Waged with his son-in-law, from whose defeat \n His spoils were meagre, and he longed to find \n A cause of battle with the Pharian realm. \n When of the banquet and of wine and feast \n They wearied and their pleasure found an end, \n Caesar drew out in colloquy the night \n Thus with Achoreus, on the highest couch \n With linen ephod as a priest begirt: \n 'O thou devoted to all sacred rites, \n 'Loved by the gods, as proves thy length of days, \n 'Tell, if thou wilt, whence sprang the Pharian race; \n 'How lie their lands, the manners of their tribes, \n 'The form and worship of their deities. \n 'Expound the sculptures on your ancient fanes: \n 'Reveal your gods if willing to be known: \n 'If to th' Athenian sage your fathers taught \n 'Their mysteries, who worthier than I \n ' To bear in trust the secrets of the world? \n ' True, by the rumour of my kinsman's flight \n ' Here was I drawn; yet also by your fame: \n ' And even in the midst of war's alarms \n ' The stars and heavenly spaces have I conned; \n 'Nor shall Eudoxus' year excel mine own. \n ' But though such ardour burns within my breast, \n ' Such zeal to know the truth, yet my chief wish \n ' To learn the source of your mysterious flood \n ' Through ages hidden : give me certain hope \n ' To see the fount of Nile-and civil war \n ' I quit for ever.' He spake, and then the priest:\n \n \n ' The secrets, Caesar, of our mighty sires \n \n ' Kept from the common people until now \n ' I hold it right to utter. Some may deem \n ' That silence on these wonders of the earth \n ' Were greater piety. But to the gods \n ' I hold it grateful that their handiwork \n ' And sacred edicts should be known to men. \n ' A different power by the primal law, \n ' Each star possesses: these alone control \n ' The movement of the sky, with adverse force \n ' Opposing: while the sun divides the year, \n ' And day from night, and by his potent rays \n ' Forbids the stars to pass their stated course. \n ' The moon by her alternate phases sets \n ' The varying limits of the sea and shore. \n ' Neath Saturn's sway the zone of ice and snow \n ' Has passed; while Mars in lightning's fitful flames \n ' And winds abounds: beneath high Jupiter \n \n ' Unvexed by storms abides a temperate air; \n ' And fruitful Venus' star contains the seeds \n ' Of all things. Ruler of the boundless deep \n ' The god Cyllenian : whene'er he holds \n ' That part of heaven where the Lion dwells \n ' With neighbouring Cancer joined, and Sirius star \n ' Flames in its fury; where the circular path \n ' (Which marks the changes of the varying year) \n ' Gives to hot Cancer and to Capricorn \n ' Their several stations, under which doth lie \n ' The fount of Nile , he, master of the waves, \n ' Strikes with his beam the waters. Forth the stream \n ' Brims from his fount, as Ocean when the moon \n ' Commands an increase; nor shall curb his flow \n ' Till night wins back her losses from the sun. \n \n ' Vain is the ancient faith that Ethiop snows \n \n ' Send Nile abundant forth upon the lands. \n ' Those mountains know nor northern wind nor star. \n ' Of this are proof the breezes of the South, \n ' Fraught with warm vapours, and the people's hue \n ' Burned dark by suns: and 'tis in time of spring, \n ' When first are thawed the snows, that ice-fed streams \n ' In swollen torrents tumble; but the Nile \n \n ' Nor lifts his wave before the Dog star burns; \n ' Nor seeks again his banks, until the sun \n ' In equal balance measures night and day. \n ' Nor are the laws that govern other streams \n ' Obeyed by Nile. For in the wintry year \n 'Were he in flood, when distant far the sun, \n ' His waters lacked their office; but he leaves \n ' His channel when the summer is at height, \n ' Tempering the torrid heat of Egypt 's clime. \n ' Such is the task of Nile ; thus in the world \n ' He finds his purpose, lest exceeding heat \n ' Consume the lands: and rising thus to meet \n ' Enkindled Lion, to Syene 's prayers \n ' By Cancer burnt gives ear; nor curbs his wave \n ' Till the slant sun and Meroe 's lengthening shades \n ' Proclaim the autumn. Who shall give the cause? \n ' 'Twas Parent Nature's self which gave command \n ' Thus for the needs of earth should flow the Nile . \n ' Vain too the fable that the western winds \n \n ' Control his current, in continuous course \n ' At stated seasons governing the air; \n ' Or hurrying from Occident to South \n ' Clouds without number which in misty folds \n ' Press on the waters; or by constant blast, \n ' Forcing his current back whose several mouths \n ' Burst on the sea;-so, forced by seas and wind, \n 'Men say, his billows pour upon the land. \n ' Some speak of hollow caverns, breathing holes \n ' Deep in the earth, within whose mighty jaws \n ' Waters in noiseless current underneath \n ' From northern cold to southern climes are drawn; \n 'And when hot Meroe pants beneath the sun, \n ' Then, say they, Ganges through the silent depths \n ' And Padus pass: and from a single fount \n ' The Nile arising not in single streams \n ' Pours all the rivers forth. And rumour says \n ' That when the sea which girdles in the world \n \n ' O'erflows, thence rushes Nile , by lengthy course, \n ' Softening his saltness. More, if it be true \n ' That ocean feeds the sun and heavenly fires, \n ' Then Phoebus journeying by the burning Crab \n ' Sucks from its waters more than air can hold \n ' Upon his passage-this the cool of night \n ' Pours on the Nile . If, Caesar, 'tis my part \n ' To judge such difference, 'twould seem that since \n ' Creation's age has passed, earth's veins by chance \n ' Some waters hold, and shaken cast them forth: \n ' But others took when first the globe was formed \n ' A sure abode; by Him who framed the world \n ' Fixed with the Universe. And, Roman, thou, \n ' In thirsting thus to know the source of Nile, \n ' Dost as the Pharian and Persian kings \n ' And those of Macedon ; nor any age \n ' Refused the secret, but the place prevailed \n ' Remote by nature. Greatest of the kings \n ' By Memphis worshipped, Alexander grudged \n \n ' To Nile its mystery, and to furthest earth \n ' Sent chosen Ethiops whom the crimson zone \n ' Stayed in their further march, while flowed his stream \n ' Warm at their feet. Sesostris westward far \n ' Reached, to the ends of earth; and necks of kings \n ' Bent 'neath his chariot yoke: but of the springs \n ' Which fill your rivers, Rhone and Po, he drank, \n 'Not of the fount of Nile . Cambyses king \n 'In madman quest led forth his host to where \n 'The long-lived races dwell: then famine struck, \n 'Ate of his dead and, Nile unknown, returned. \n No lying rumour of thy hidden source \n 'Has e'er made mention; wheresoe'er thou art \n 'Yet art thou sought, nor yet has nation claimed \n 'In pride of place thy river as its own. \n ' Yet shall I tell, so far as has the god, \n ' Who veils thy fountain, given me to know, \n 'Thy progress. Daring to upraise thy banks \n ''Gainst fiery Cancer's heat, thou tak'st thy rise \n 'Beneath the zenith: straight towards the north \n 'And mid Bootes flowing; to the couch \n 'Bending, or to the risings, of the sun \n 'In sinuous bends alternate; just alike \n 'To Araby's peoples and to Libyan sands. \n 'By Seres \n first beheld, yet know they not \n Whence art thou come; and with no native stream \n Strik'st thou the Ethiop fields. Nor knows the world \n 'To whom it owes thee. Nature ne'er revealed \n 'Thy secret origin, removed afar. \n 'Nor did she wish thee to be seen of men \n ' While still a tiny rivulet, but preferred \n ' Their wonder to their knowledge. Where the sun \n ' Stays at his limit, dost thou rise in flood \n ' Untimely; such thy right: to other lands \n ' Bearing thy winter: and by both the poles \n ' Thou only wanderest. Here men ask thy rise \n ' And there thine ending. Meroe rich in soil \n 'And tilled by swarthy husbandmen divides \n 'Thy broad expanse, rejoicing in the leaves \n 'Of groves of ebony, which though spreading far \n 'Their branching foliage, by no breadth of shade \n 'Soften the summer sun-whose rays direct \n 'Pass from the Lion to the fervid earth. \n \n 'Next dost thou journey onwards past the realm \n 'Of burning Phoebus, and the sterile sands, \n 'With equal volume; now with all thy strength \n 'Gathered in one, and now in devious streams \n 'Parting the bank that crumbles at thy touch. \n 'Then by our kingdom's gates, where Philae parts \n 'Arabian peoples from Egyptian fields \n ' The sluggish bosom of thy flood recalls \n ' Thy wandering currents, which through desert wastes \n ' Flow gently on to where the merchant track \n ' Divides the Red Sea waters from our own. \n ' Who, gazing, Nile , upon thy tranquil flow, \n ' Could picture how in wild array of foam \n ' (Where shelves the earth) thy billows shall be plunged \n ' Down the steep cataracts, in fuming wrath \n ' That rocks should bar the passage of thy stream \n ' Free from its source? For whirled on high the spray \n ' Aims at the stars, and trembles all the air \n With rush of waters; and with sounding roar \n The foaming mass down from the summit pours \n In hoary waves victorious. Next an isle \n In all our ancient lore \"untrodden\" named \n Stems firm thy torrent; and the rocks we call \n Springs of the river, for that here are marked \n The earliest tokens of the coming flood. \n With mountain shores now nature hems thee in \n And shuts thy waves from Libya ; in the midst \n Hence do thy waters run, till Memphis first \n Forbids the barrier placed upon thy stream \n And gives thee access to the open fields.'\n \n \n Thus did they pass, as though in peace profound, \n The nightly watches. But Pothinus' mind, \n Once with accursed butchery imbued, \n Was frenzied still; since great Pompeius fell \n No deed to him was crime; his rabid soul \n Th' avenging goddesses and Magnus' shade \n Stirred to fresh horrors; and a Pharian hand \n No less was worthy, as he deemed, to shed \n That blood which Fortune purposed should bedew \n The conquered fathers: and the fell revenge \n Due to the senate for the civil war \n This hireling almost snatched. Avert, ye fates, \n Far hence the shame that not by Brutus' hand \n This blow be struck! Shall thus the tyrant's fall, \n Just at our hands, become a Pharian crime. \n Reft of example? To prepare a plan \n (Fated to fail) he dares; nor veils in fraud \n A plot for murder, but with open war \n Attacks th' unconquered chieftain : from his crimes \n He gained such courage as to send command \n To lop the head of Caesar, and to join \n In death the kinsmen chiefs. These words by night \n His faithful servants to Achillas bear, \n His foul associate, whom the boy had made \n Chief of his armies, and who ruled alone \n O'er Egypt's land and o'er himself her king: \n ' Now lay thy limbs upon the sumptuous couch \n ' And sleep in luxury, for the Queen hath seized \n 'The palace; nor alone by her betrayed, \n ' But Caesar's gift, is Pharos. Dost delay \n ' Nor hasten to the chamber of thy Queen? \n ' Thou only? Married to the Latian chief, \n 'The impious sister now her brother weds \n ' And hurrying from rival spouse to spouse \n ' Hath Egypt won, and plays the bawd for Rome . \n ' By amorous potions she has won the man: \n ' Then trust the boy! Yet give him but a night \n ' In her enfondling arms, and drunk with love \n ' Thy life and mine he'll barter for a kiss. \n ' We for his sister's charms by cross and flame \n ' Shall pay the penalty: nor hope of aid; \n ' Here stands adulterous Caesar, here the King \n ' Her spouse: how hope we from so stern a judge \n ' To gain acquittal? Shall she not condemn \n 'Those who ne'er sought her favours? By the deed \n We dared together and lost, by Magnus' blood \n ' Which wrought the bond between us, be thou swift \n ' With hasty tumult to arouse the war: \n ' Dash in with nightly band, and mar with death \n ' Their shameless nuptials: on the very bed \n With either lover smite the ruthless Queen. \n ' Nor let the fortunes of the Western chief \n ' Make pause our enterprise. We share with him \n ' The glory of his empire o'er the world. \n ' Pompeius fallen makes us too sublime, \n There lies the shore that bids us hope success: \n Ask of our power from the polluted wave, \n And gaze upon the scanty tomb which holds \n Not all Pompeius' ashes. Peer to him \n Was he whom now thou fearest. Noble blood, \n ' True, is not ours: what boots it? Nor are realms \n ' Nor wealth of peoples given to our command. \n 'Yet have we risen to a height of power \n For deeds of blood, and Fortune to our hands \n Attracts her victims. Lo! a nobler now \n Lies in our compass, and a second death \n Hesperia shall appease; for Caesar's blood, \n Shed by these hands, shall give us this, that Rome \n \n Shall love us, guilty of Pompeius' fall. \n Why fear these titles, why this chieftain's strength? \n For shorn of these, before your swords he lies \n A common soldier. To the civil war \n This night shall bring completion, and shall give \n To peoples slain fit offerings, and send \n That life the world demands beneath the shades. \n Rise then in all your hardihood and smite \n This Caesar down, and let the Roman youths \n Strike for themselves, and Lagos for its King. \n No do thou tarry: full of wine and feast \n Thou'lt fall upon him in the lists of love; \n Then dare the venture, and the heavenly gods \n Shall grant of Cato's and of Brutus' prayers \n To thee fulfilment.' \n Nor was Achillas slow \n To hear the voice that counselled him to crime. \n No sounding clarion summoned, as is wont, \n His troops to arms; nor trumpet blare betrayed \n Their nightly march: but rapidly he seized \n All needed instruments of blood and war. \n Of Latian race the most part of his train, \n Yet to barbarian customs were their minds \n By long forgetfulness of Rome debased: \n Else had it shamed to serve the Pharian King; \n But now his vassal and his minion's word \n Compel obedience. Those who serve in camps \n Lose faith and love of kin: their pittance earned \n \n Makes just the deed: and for their sordid pay, \n Not for themselves, they threaten Caesar's life. \n Where finds the piteous destiny of the realm \n \n Rome with herself at peace? The host withdrawn \n From dread Thessalia raves on Nilus' banks \n As all the race of Rome . What more had dared, \n With Magnus welcomed, the Lagean house? \n Each hand must render to the gods their due, \n Nor son of Rome may cease from civil war; \n By Heaven's command our state was rent in twain; \n Nor love for husband nor regard for sire \n Parted our peoples. 'Twas a slave who stirred \n Afresh the conflict, and Achillas grasped \n In turn the sword of Rome : nay more, had won, \n Had not the fates adverse restrained his hand \n From Caesar's slaughter. \n For the murderous pair \n Ripe for their plot were met; the spacious hall \n Still busied with the feast. So might have flowed \n Into the kingly cups a stream of gore, \n And in mid banquet fallen Caesar's head. \n Yet did they fear lest in the nightly strife \n (The fates permitting) some incautious hand- \n So did they trust the sword-might slay the King. \n Thus stayed the deed, for in the minds of slaves \n The chance of doing Caesar to the death \n Might bear postponement: when the day arose \n Then should he suffer; and a night of life \n Thus by Pothinus was to Caesar given.\n \n \n Now from the Casian rock looked forth the Sun \n Flooding the land of Egypt with a day \n Warm from its earliest dawn, when from the walls \n Not wandering in disorder are they seen, \n But drawn in close array, as though to meet \n A foe opposing; ready to receive \n Or give the battle. Caesar, in the town \n Placing no trust, within the palace courts \n Lay in ignoble hiding place, the gates \n Close barred : nor all the kingly rooms possessed, \n But in the narrowest portion of the space \n He drew his band together. There in arms \n They stood, with dread and fury in their souls. \n He feared attack, indignant at his fear. \n Thus will a noble beast in little cage \n Imprisoned, fume, and break upon the bars \n His teeth in frenzied wrath; nor more would rage \n The flames of Vulcan in Sicilian depths \n Should Etna 's top be closed. He who but now \n By Haemus ' mount against Pompeius chief, \n \n Italia 's leaders and the Senate line, \n His cause forbidding hope, looked at the fates \n He knew were hostile, with unfaltering gaze, \n Now fears before the crime of hireling slaves, \n And in mid palace trembles at the blow: \n He whom nor Scythian nor Alaun had dared \n To violate, nor the Moor who aims the dart \n Upon his victim slain, to prove his skill. \n The Roman world but now did not suffice \n To hold him, nor the realms from furthest Ind \n To Tyrian Gades. Now, as puny boy, \n Or woman, trembling when a town is sacked, \n Within the narrow corners of a house \n He seeks for safety; on the portals closed \n His hope of life: and with uncertain gait \n He treads the halls; yet not without the King; \n In purpose, Ptolemaeus, that thy life \n For his shall give atonement; and to hurl \n Thy severed head among the servant throng \n Should darts and torches fail. So story tells \n The Colchian princess with sword in hand, \n And with her brother's neck bared to the blow, \n Waited her sire, avenger of his realm \n Despoiled, and of her flight. In the imminent risk \n Caesar, in hopes of peace, an envoy sent \n To the fierce vassals, from their absent lord \n Bearing a message, thus : ' At whose command \n Wage ye the war?' But not the laws which bind \n All nations upon earth, nor sacred rights, \n Availed to save or messenger of peace, \n Or King's ambassador; or thee from crime \n Such as befitted thee, thou land of Nile \n \n Fruitful in monstrous deeds: not Juba's realm, \n Vast though it be, nor Pontus , nor the land \n Thessalian, nor the arms of Pharnaces, \n Nor yet the tracts which chill Iberus girds, \n Nor Libyan coasts such wickedness have dared, \n As thou, and all thy minions. Closer now \n War hemmed them in, and weapons in the courts, \n Shaking the innermost recesses, fell. \n Yet did no ram, fatal with single stroke, \n Assail the portal, nor machine of war; \n Nor flame they called in aid; but blind of plan \n They wander purposeless, in separate bands \n Around the circuit, nor at any spot \n With strength combined attempt to breach the wall. \n The fates forbad, and Fortune from their hands \n Held fast the palace as a battlement. \n Nor failed they to attack from ships of war \n The regal dwelling, where its frontage bold \n Made stand apart the waters of the deep : \n There, too, was Caesar's all-protecting arm; \n For these at point of sword, and those with fire \n He forces back, and though besieged he dares \n To storm th' assailants: and as lay the ships \n Joined rank to rank, bids drop upon their sides \n Lamps drenched with reeking tar. Nor slow the fire \n To seize the hempen cables and the decks \n Oozing with melting pitch; the oarsman's bench \n All in one moment, and the topmost yards \n Burst into flame: half merged the vessels lay \n While swam the foemen, all in arms, the wave; \n Nor fell the blaze upon the ships alone, \n But seized with writhing tongues the neighbouring homes, \n \n And fanned to fury by the Southern breeze \n Tempestuous, it leaped from roof to roof; \n Not otherwise than on its heavenly track, \n Unfed by matter, glides the ball of light, \n By air alone aflame. \n This pest recalled \n Some of the forces to the city's aid \n From the besieged halls. Nor Caesar gave \n To sleep its season; swifter than all else \n To seize the crucial moment of the war. \n Quick in the darkest watches of the night \n He leaped upon his ships, and Pharos seized, \n Gate of the main; an island in the days \n Of Proteus seer, now bordering the walls \n Of Alexander's city. Thus he gained \n A double vantage, for his foes were pent \n Within the narrow entrance, which for him \n And for his aids gave access to the sea. \n Nor longer was Pothinus' doom delayed, \n Yet not with cross or flame, nor with the wrath \n His crime demanded; nor by savage beasts \n Torn, did he suffer; but by Magnus' death, \n Alas the shame! he fell; his head by sword \n Hacked from his shoulders. Next by frauds prepared \n By Ganymede her base attendant, fled \n \n Arsinoe \n from the Court to Caesar's foes; \n There in the absence of the King she ruled \n As of Lagean blood: there at her hands, \n The savage minion of the tyrant boy, \n Achillas, fell by just avenging sword. \n Thus did another victim to thy shade \n Atone, Pompeius; but the gods forbid \n That this be all thy vengeance! Not the King \n Nor all the stock of Lagos for thy death \n Would make fit sacrifice! So Fortune deemed; \n And not till patriot swords shall drink the blood \n Of Caesar, Magnus, shalt thou be appeased. \n Still, though was slain the author of the strife, \n Sank not their rage: with Ganymede for chief \n Again they rush to arms; in deeds of fight \n Again they conquer. So might that one day \n Have witnessed Caesar's fate; so might its fame \n Have lived through ages. \n As the Roman Chief, \n Crushed on the narrow surface of the mole, \n Prepared to throw his troops upon the ships, \n Sudden upon him the surrounding foes \n With all their terrors came. In dense array \n Their navy lined the shores, while on the rear \n The footmen ceaseless charged. No hope was left, \n For flight was not, nor could the brave man's arm \n Achieve or safety or a glorious death. \n Not now were needed for great Caesar's fall, \n Caught in the toils of nature, routed host \n Or mighty heaps of slain: his only doubt \n To fear or hope for death: while on his brain \n Brave Scaeva's image flashed, now vainly sought, \n Who on the wall by Epidamnus ' fields \n Earned fame immortal, and with single arm \n Drove back Pompeius as he trod the breach. \n "
