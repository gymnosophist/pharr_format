The Roman line stood in triple ranks.\n\t\t\t\t Some of the light-armed were posted in the intervals between the maniples in advance of the standards, some placed behind the standards.\n\t\t\t\t Cavalry covered the wings. Hasdrubal made a strong centre of Spanish troops; on the right wing he placed Carthaginians, on the left Africans and mercenary auxiliaries. Of the cavalry he stationed the Numidians on the wing of the Carthaginian infantry, the rest on that of the Africans.\n\t\t\t\t And not all of his Numidians were placed on the right wing, but only those who, taking two horses apiece after the manner of performers, had the custom of leaping armed from the tired horse to the fresh, often in the very heat of battle; such was the agility of the men, and so well-trained their breed of horses.\n\t\t\t\t While they were standing in this array, the hopes of the generals on the two sides were fairly balanced; for there was also not much superiority for the one army or the other either in the number or the type of its soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t But the spirit of the soldiers was far from being matched. For the Romans, although fighting far from their country, had been easily persuaded by their generals that they were fighting in defence of Italy and the city of Rome. And so, as men whose return to their native land would depend upon the issue of that battle, they had made up their minds to win or die.\n\t\t\t\t The other battle-line had men less firmly resolved. For the majority were Spaniards, who preferred to be vanquished in Spain, rather than as victors to be dragged to Italy.\n\t\t\t\t Therefore at the first clash, when they had barely hurled their javelins, the centre fell back, and, as the Romans advanced with a great charge, retreated. On the wrings, however, there was more spirited fighting.\n\t\t\t\t On the one hand the Carthaginians pressed them hard, on the other hand the Africans; and it was a double conflict against men presumed to have been surrounded.\n\t\t\t\t But, although the whole Roman line had by this time crowded into the centre, it had sufficient strength to force apart the wings of the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t Thus there were two battles in opposite directions.

His camp the Romans captured and plundered.\n\t\t\t\t That battle brought to the Roman side all that still wavered in Spain, and Hasdrubal had left to him no hope, not only of leading his army over into Italy, but not even of remaining with any safety in Spain.\n\t\t\t\t When these facts were generally known at Rome through the letter of the Scipios, people rejoiced, not so much over the victory, as that Hasdrubal's crossing into Italy had been prevented."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "30"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11??"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "13"}], "note": ["For the long siege of Petelia cf. the note on xx. 10.", "Polybius also (VII. i. 3) gave such details as follow.", "The story of the siege and capture of Croton, on the Gulf of Tarentum, is told in some detail in XXIV. ii f.", {"@type": "margin", "#text": "B.C. 216"}, "Polybius makes him a model of filial devotion (VII. viii. 9).

Meantime the Locrians hastily brought grain and wood and the other things needed to supply their wants from the farms into the city, also that no booty might be left for the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t And every day a larger crowd poured out of all the gates. Finally there were left in the city only six hundred men, who were made to repair walls and gates and to carry arms to the battlements.\n\t\t\t\t Against the multitude made up of all ages and classes, wandering about the country, many of the unarmed, Hamilcar the Carthaginian sent out his cavalry. Forbidden to injure anyone, they interposed their squadrons merely to shut off from the city those who had scattered in flight.\n\t\t\t\t The commander himself, after capturing higher ground from which he could see the country and the city, ordered a cohort of Bruttii to go up to the walls and call out the chief men of the Locrians to a conference, and with a promise of Hannibal's friendship to encourage them to surrender the city. In the conference the Bruttians at first were not believed at all.\n\t\t\t\t Then, when the Carthaginians were seen on the hills, and a few returning fugitives repeatedly asserted that all the rest of the multitude were in the power of the enemy, overcome by fear, they answered that they would consult the people.\n\t\t\t\t An assembly being at once called, all the fickle preferred political change and a new alliance; also those whose relations had been shut off outside the city by the enemy had mortgaged their affections, having virtually given hostages.\n\t\t\t\t And the few silently approved of steadfast loyalty, rather than dared to declare and defend it. Hence surrender to the Carthaginians was voted with apparently unquestioned unanimity.\n\t\t\t\t After Lucius Atilius, commander of the garrison, and the Roman soldiers who were with him had been secretly led down to the harbour and put on ships to be carried to Regium, they admitted Hamilcar and the Carthaginians into the city on condition that a treaty be made at once on fair terms.\n\t\t\t\t The promise of such a treaty was almost broken after they surrendered, when the Carthaginian charged that the Roman had been allowed by trickery to go away, while the Locrians pleaded that he had escaped unaided.\n\t\t\t\t Also the cavalry pursued him in the hope that possibly the current in the strait might delay the ships or bring them to shore. They did not indeed overtake the men they were pursuing, but they sighted other ships crossing the strait from Messana to Regium.

There a sacred grove, which was enclosed by dense woods and tall fir-trees, had in its centre luxuriant pastures, where cattle of all kinds, being sacred to the goddess, used to pasture without any\n\t\t\t\t shepherd. And at night the flocks of each kind would return separately to their stalls, being never harmed by wild beasts lying in wait, nor by the dishonesty of\n\t\t\t\t men. Therefore great profits were made from the cattle, and out of the profits a massive golden column was wrought and consecrated. And the temple was famous for its wealth also, not merely for its\n\t\t\t\t sanctity. They give it some pretended marvels also, as generally in places so noted. It is reported that in the space in front of the temple there is an altar whose ashes are never stirred by any\n\t\t\t\t wind.

Aristomachus, since he was unable by persuasion to bring them to surrender and could find no opportunity to betray the citadel, as he had betrayed the city, alone went over to\n\t\t\t\t Hanno. Soon after that the Locrian legates entered the citadel with Hanno's consent and persuaded them to allow themselves to be transferred to Locri, and not to risk desperate\n\t\t\t\t measures.

When this sprung backward to the ground owing to the shifting of a heavy leaden weight, it would set the ship on its stern, bow in air.\n\t\t\t\t Then, suddenly released, it would dash the ship, falling, as it were, from the wall, into the sea, to the great alarm of the sailors, and with the result that, even if she fell upright, she would take considerable water.\n\t\t\t\t Thus the assault from the sea was baffled, and all hope shifted to a plan to attack from the land with all their forces.\n\t\t\t\t But that side also had been provided with the same complete equipment of artillery, at the expense and the pains of Hiero during many years, by the unrivalled art of Archimedes.\n\t\t\t\t The nature of the place also helped, in that the rock on which the foundations of the wall were laid is generally so steep that not only missiles from a machine, but also whatever rolled down of its own weight fell heavily upon the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t The same circumstance made approach to the wall difficult and footing unsteady.\n\t\t\t\t So, after a war council, since every attempt was being balked, it was decided to give up the assault and merely by a blockade to cut off the enemy by land and sea from their supplies."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "35"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "36"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}], "note": ["West of Agrigentum, on the south coast.", {"@type": "margin", "#text": "B.C. 214"}, "To the west of Syracuse, as was Acrae, xxxvi. 1."], "pb": {"@id": "p.289"}, "#text": "Meanwhile Marcellus set out with about a third of his army to recover the cities which in the unsettled state of affairs had gone over to the Carthaginians.\n\t\t\t\t Helorus and Herbesus he did recover by their own surrender; Megara he took by assault, destroyed and plundered, to terrify the others and especially the Syracusans.\n\t\t\t\t About the same time also Himilco, who had long kept his fleet off the promontory of Pachynum, landed at Heraclea, called Minoa, 25,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and twelve elephants, a very much larger force than that with which he had previously kept his fleet off Pachynum.\n\t\t\t\t But after Syracuse had been seized by Hippocrates, Himilco went to Carthage and was aided there both by the legates of Hippocrates and by a letter from Hannibal, who said the time had come to recover Sicily in the most honourable manner.\n\t\t\t\t Himilco himself, being an influential adviser, present in person, had easily prevailed upon them to send across to Sicily the largest possible forces of infantry and cavalry.

Then the second prophecy was read, being not only more obscure because the future is more uncertain\n\t\t\t\t than the past, but more difficult also in the way it was written.\n\t\t\t\t  For the interpretation of the prophecy they took one day.\n\t\t\t\t On the next day the senate made a decree that in regard to the festival to be held and the sacrifices in honour of Apollo the decemvirs should consult the books.\n\t\t\t\t Those passages having been consulted and reported to the senate, the fathers voted that a festival should be vowed and held in honour of Apollo, and after the festival had been held the sum of twelve thousand asses should be given to the praetor for the ceremonies, and two full-grown victims.\n\t\t\t\t A second decree of the senate was made, that the decemvirs should offer sacrifice according to Greek rite and with these victims: to Apollo an ox with gilded horns and two white she-goats with gilded horns, to Latona a cow with gilded horns.\n\t\t\t\t When the praetor was about to open the festival in the Circus Maximus, he ordered by edict that during that feast the people should make their contribution to Apollo according to their means.\n\t\t\t\t Such is the origin of the festival of Apollo, vowed and kept to secure victory, not health, as most think. The people wore garlands at the spectacles, the matrons offered prayers, everybody feasted in the atrium with open doors, and the day was kept with every kind of ceremony."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "13"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.389"}, {"@id": "p.391"}], "note": [{"@type": "margin", "#text": "B.C. 212"}, {"@type": "margin", "#text": "B.C. 212"}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "I.e."}, "#text": "not Campanians."}], "#text": "While Hannibal was near Tarentum, and both consuls were in Samnium but seemed about to invest Capua, already the Campanians were suffering hunger (the usual hardship of a long investment), because the Roman armies had prevented them from sowing.\n\t\t\t\t And so they sent legates to Hannibal, praying that, before the consuls should lead the legions into their lands and all the roads should be blocked by forces of the enemy, he should order grain to be brought from neighbouring places to Capua.\n\t\t\t\t Hannibal ordered Hanno to march with his army from the land of the Bruttii over into Campania, and to see to it that the Campanians should have a supply of grain.\n\t\t\t\t Hanno set out from the land of the Bruttii with his army, avoided camps of the enemy and the consuls, who were in Samnium, and when he was now nearing Beneventum, pitched camp on high ground three miles from the city itself.\n\t\t\t\t Then he ordered grain to be brought into camp from allied peoples of the neighbourhood, among whom it had been garnered in the summer; and he furnished troops to escort the supplies.\n\t\t\t\t Then he sent word to Capua, naming a day on which they should appear at the camp to get their grain, after bringing together from the farms on all sides every kind of vehicle and beast of burden.\n\t\t\t\t This order was carried out by the Campanians with their usual carelessness and indifference.

Sosis, one of the slayers of the tyrant, was sent to him by Marcellus, and after being balked and put off by the delivery of a long speech, he reported to Marcellus that Philodemus had taken time to consider.\n\t\t\t\t Philodemus was postponing from day to day, waiting for Hippocrates and Himilco to move up their camp and legions, and not doubting that, if he should get them into the citadel, the Roman army, shut up within the city walls, could be destroyed.\n\t\t\t\t Consequently Marcellus, seeing that Euryalus could neither be won by surrender nor by assault, pitched his camp between Neapolis and Tycha, these being the names of quarters of the city, virtually cities in themselves. For he feared that, if he should enter thickly settled parts, the soldiers in their eagerness for booty could not be restrained from scattering.\n\t\t\t\t To this camp came legates from Tycha and Neapolis with fillets and woollen bands, praying that they be spared bloodshed and fires.\n\t\t\t\t Marcellus held a council in regard to their prayers such they were rather than demands and with the approval of all gave an order to the soldiers that no one should injure a free person; everything else would be spoil.\n\t\t\t\t The camp was enclosed by bricks from house-walls to serve as a wall of defence. At those camp gates which opened toward the streets outposts and detachments were stationed by Marcellus, that no attack upon the camp might occur while the soldiers were\n\t\t\t\t dispersed. Then at a given signal the soldiers scattered. And although doors were forced and everywhere were the sounds of panic and uproar, they nevertheless refrained from bloodshed. To plundering there was no limit until they had carried away all the possessions accumulated in a long-continued\n\t\t\t\t prosperity. Meanwhile even Philodemus, having no hope of assistance and receiving assurance that he might return unharmed to Epicydes, led his garrison out and surrendered the hill to the\n\t\t\t\t Romans. While the attention of all was diverted in the direction of the uproar of a city in part captured, Bomilcar, favoured by such a night that on account of a violent storm the Roman fleet could\n\t\t\t\t not ride at anchor in open water, came out of the harbour of Syracuse with thirty-five ships, and with no enemy to prevent, put to sea, leaving fifty-five ships to Epicydes and the\n\t\t\t\t Syracusans. And after informing the Carthaginians how critical was the situation at Syracuse, he returned after a few days with a hundred ships.

Some slay the enemy half-asleep, some throw firebrands on the dry, thatched huts, some seize the gates, to block escape.\n\t\t\t\t As for the enemy, fire, shouting and slaughter, all at once, make them virtually senseless and do not allow them to hear any orders or to look out for themselves. Unharmed they encounter bodies of armed men.\n\t\t\t\t Some rush to the gates, others, since the roads are blocked, leap over the earthwork. And everyone who escaped fled at once in the direction of the other camp;\n\t\t\t\t whereupon they were surrounded by the cohort and cavalry dashing out of their hiding place and were slain to the last man.\n\t\t\t\t Yet, even if a man had escaped from that slaughter, so swiftly did the Romans hasten from the captured nearer camp to the other camp that news of the disaster could not anticipate them.\n\t\t\t\t But there, the farther it was from their enemy, and since some had scattered just before daylight to bring in fodder and firewood and booty, the more neglect and disorder did they find everywhere; only stacked arms at the outposts, the soldiers unarmed, either sitting and lying on the ground or strolling outside the wall and the gates. Against these men, so care-free and regardless of order, the Romans, who were still fired by their recent battle and made confident by victory, went into battle.\n\t\t\t\t And so no resistance whatever could be offered at the gates. Inside the gates there was a rush from every part of the camp at the first shouting and commotion, and a fierce battle began.\n\t\t\t\t It would have lasted long too, had not the sight of the Romans' bloody shields given the Carthaginians evidence of the other disaster and consequently inspired alarm. This terror made them all take to flight, and pouring out wherever a way could be found  except those overtaken by the sword they lost possession of the\n\t\t\t\t camp. Thus in a night and a day two camps of the enemy were taken by assault under the command of Lucius\n\t\t\t\t Marcius. That about thirty-seven thousand of the enemy were slain is the statement of Claudius, who translated Acilius' annals out of Greek into the Latin language; that about one thousand eight hundred and thirty were captured and a vast amount of booty\n\t\t\t\t taken. And in this he says that there was a silver shield weighing a hundred and thirty-seven pounds, bearing the likeness of Hasdrubal\n\t\t\t\t Barca. Valerius of Antium relates that one camp was captured, that of Mago, and seven thousand of the enemy slain; that in a second battle they sallied out and fought with Hasdrubal; that ten thousand were slain, four thousand three hundred and thirty\n\t\t\t\t captured. Piso states that five thousand men were slain from an ambush, while Mago was pursuing in disorder our retreating\n\t\t\t\t men. In all of them great is the name of Marcius the general. And to his real fame they add even marvels: that as he was speaking a flame burst from his head without his knowledge, causing great alarm among the soldiers who stood around\n\t\t\t\t him. They say that as a memorial of his victory over the Carthaginians, down to the burning of the Capitol there was in the temple a shield called the Marcian, bearing a likeness of\n\t\t\t\t Hasdrubal.
