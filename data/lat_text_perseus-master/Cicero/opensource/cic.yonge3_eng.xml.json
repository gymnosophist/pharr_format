The cause now came before the\n                            priests on the last day of September. Cicero endeavoured, in the first\n                            place, to disabuse their minds of any enmity to him which might have\n                            been instilled into their minds by Clodius on account of his late\n                            conduct with respect to Pompey. (For there had been a great scarcity at\n                                , partly occasioned by\n                            the great multitudes that had come from all parts of  on Cicero's account; and Cicero\n                            had supported a resolution of the senate by which Pompey was entreated\n                            to undertake the province of restoring plenty to the city, and to this\n                            end the consuls had been ordered to draw up a law by which the whole\n                            administration of the corn and provisions of the republic was granted to\n                            Pompey for five years. And in consequence of Cicero's advocacy of the\n                            measure Clodius endeavoured to excite odium against him, as having\n                            deserted the cause of the senate to pay court to Pompey; though the\n                            measure had been very successful, as the credit of Pompey's name\n                            immediately reduced the price of provisions in the markets.)"}, "As, however, the main question turned upon the legality of the\n                            consecration, Cicero applies to establish the fact of its illegality by\n                            proving that Clodius could not legally consecrate anything, as his\n                            election to the tribunate was illegal; since his adoption into a\n                            plebeian family, or at least into that particular family into which he\n                            had been adopted, was in violation and defiance of all the laws made for\n                            such cases; if his adoption was illegal, clearly he could not have\n                            legally been elected tribune, nor have legally done any action as\n                            tribune.", "The priests decided that if he who performed the office of consecration\n                            had not been legally authorized to do so, then the area in question\n                            might without any scruple of religion be restored to Cicero.

I can address\n                        this argument to those men, who state that if any matter must be entrusted\n                        to one individual, then they would rather entrust it to Cnaeus Pompeius than\n                        to any one, but that they make a rule of never entrusting anything to any\n                        one in an irregular manner; still, after it has been entrusted to Pompeius,\n                        that they then vindicate and uphold the measure, as is due to the dignity of\n                        the man. From praising the statements of these men I am hindered by the\n                        triumphs of Cnaeus Pompeius, by which he (though it was quite out of the\n                        regular order of things that he was summoned to defend his country)\n                        increased the reputation of the Roman people, and crowned their empire with\n                        honour. At the same time I praise their firmness, which is a virtue which I\n                        have need to avail myself of, since it was on my proposition that he was\n                        appointed, quite out of the regular routine, to conduct the war against\n                        Mithridates and Tigranes.  But still there\n                        are some points which I can argue with them; but still, how great is your\n                        impudence, when you dare to say that nothing ought to be given to any one\n                        out of the regular routine! You who, when, by an iniquitous law, for some\n                        unknown cause you had confiscated the property of Ptolemy, King of\n                            , the brother of the King\n                        of Alexandria, who was reigning by the same right as he was, and had\n                        involved the Roman people in the crime,when you had sent a band\n                        of robbers from this empire to ravage his kingdom, and goods, and property,\n                        though there had been a long alliance and friendship between us and his\n                        father, and grandfather, and still more remote\n                        ancestors,appointed Marcus Cato to superintend the carrying away\n                        of his money, and the managing the war if any individual was found hardy\n                        enough to defend his own property.

I say that this was the law\n                        in this state even at the time when the kings existed; I say that this was\n                        the principle handed down to us from our ancestors; I say, moreover, that\n                        this is the inalienable characteristic of a free state,that no\n                        infringement on the liberties or property of a citizen can take place\n                        without the formal decision of the senate, or of the people, or of those\n                        persons who have been appointed as judges in each separate matter.\n                             Do you not see that I am destroying\n                        all your proceedings by the roots? that I am arguing, what is manifest, that\n                        you did nothing whatever according to law,that you were not a\n                        tribune of the people at all? I say this, that you are a patrician. I say so\n                        before the priests; the augurs are present. I take my stand on the common\n                        public law. What, O priests is the law concerning adoption? Why that he may\n                        adopt children who is no longer able to have children himself, and who\n                        failed in having them when he was of an age to expect it. What reason, then,\n                        any one has for adopting children, what considerations of family or dignity\n                        are involved what principles of religion are concerned, are questions which\n                        are accustomed to be put to the college of priests. What if all these\n                        circumstances are found to exist in that adoption? The person who adopts him\n                        is twenty years old; a minor adopts a senator. Does he do so for the sake of\n                        having children? He is of an age to have them of his own. He has a wife; he\n                        has actually got children of his own. The father, then, will be\n                        disinheriting his own son.  What? why\n                        should all the sacred rites of the Clodian family perish, as far as it\n                        depends on you? And that must have been the idea of all the priests when you\n                        were adopted. Unless, perchance, the question was put to you in this\n                        way,whether you were intending to disturb the republic by\n                        seditions, and whether you wished to be adopted with that object, not in\n                        order to become that man's son, but only in order to be made a tribune of\n                        the people, and by that means utterly to overthrow the state? You answered,\n                        I presume, that your object was only to be made a tribune. That appeared to\n                        the priests to be a sufficient reason. They approved of it. No questions\n                        were asked about the age of the man who was adopting you; as was done in the\n                        case of Cnaeus Aufidius and Marcus Pupius, each of whom, within our\n                        recollection, when extremely old, adopted as sons, the one Orestes, and the\n                        other Piso. And these adoptions, like others, more than I can count, were\n                        followed by the inheritance of the name and  property and sacred\n                        rites of the family. You are not Fonteius, as you ought to be, nor the heir\n                        of your new father; nor, though you have lost your right to the sacred\n                        ceremonies of your own family, have you availed yourself of those which\n                        belong to you by adoption. And so, having thrown the ceremonies of religion\n                        into confusion,having polluted both families, both the one which\n                        you have abandoned and the one which you have entered,having\n                        violated the legitimate practices of the Romans with respect to\n                        guardianships and inheritances, you have been made, contrary to all the\n                        requirements of religion, the son of that man of whom you were old enough to\n                        be the father."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "37", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "38", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "15", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "39", "@unit": "section"}], "note": [{"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": {"@lang": "la", "#text": "pontifices"}, "bibl": {"@n": "Liv. 10.6", "#text": "Livy, x 6."}, "#text": "When the\n                            number of  was increased to\n                            eight, it was provided that one half of that number should always be\n                            plebeians.

In the first place, because your respective\n                        ages are such that the man who has adopted you as your father might, as far\n                        as his age went, have been your son; in the second place, because a question\n                        is usually put as to the reason for the adoption, in order that the adopter\n                        may be a person who is seeking by regular and sacerdotal law that which by\n                        the ordinary process of nature he is no longer able to obtain; and that he\n                        may adopt a son in such a manner, as to in nowise impair the dignity of the\n                        families or the reverence belonging to their sacred ceremonies; and, above\n                        all things, that no false pretence, or fraud, or trickery, may creep in; so\n                        that this fictitious adoption of a son may appear to imitate as far as\n                        possible the real case of children being born to a man.  But what greater false pretence can there be than for a\n                        beardless young man, a vigorous man and a husband, to come forward, and to\n                        say that he wishes to adopt as his own son a senator of the Roman people,\n                        and for all men to know and see that this senator is adopted, not in order\n                        to become really the son of the plebeian, but merely in order that he may\n                        quit the patrician body, and be made a tribune of the people? And all that\n                        without any disguise. For in this case the adopted son was immediately\n                        emancipated, lest he should really have become the son of him who adopted\n                        him. Why then is he adopted at all? Only approve of this sort of adoption,\n                        and in a moment the sacred ceremonies of every family, of which you ought to\n                        be the guardians, will be abolished, and not one patrician will be left. For\n                        why should any one be willing to be incapable of being made a tribune of the\n                        people? to have his power of standing for the consulship narrowed? and,\n                        while he might arrive at the priesthood, not to arrive at it because there\n                        is not a vacancy at the moment for a patrician? Whenever\n                        anything happens to any one to make it more convenient for him to be a\n                        plebeian, he will be adopted in the same manner as Clodius.  And so in a short time the Roman people will\n                        neither have a king of the sacrifices, nor , nor\n                            Salii, nor one half of the rest of the\n                        priests, nor any one who has a right to open the , or ; and the\n                             of the Roman people must come to\n                        an end if no patrician magistrates are created, as there will be no\n                            interrex, for he must be a patrician, and must be\n                        nominated by a patrician. I said before the priests, that that adoption had\n                        not been approved by any decree of this college; that it had been executed\n                        contrary to every provision of the sacerdotal law; that it ought to be\n                        considered as no adoption at all; and if there is an end to that, you see at\n                        once that there is an end likewise of the whole of your tribuneship."}, {"foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "Lex\n                            curiata"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "auspices"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "auspices"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "auspices"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "auspices"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "auspices"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "foreign": [{"@lang": "la", "#text": "Lex\n                                curiata"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "comitia\n                                curiata"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "comitia"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "arrogatio"}, {"@lang": "la", "#text": "pontifices"}], "#text": "A  was a law passed by the .

He said that I had consulted the\n                        interests of the republic; that I had yielded to the tempest; that I had\n                        been more friendly to you and to the rest of the citizens than to myself and\n                        to my own relations; that I had been driven away by the disturbances of a\n                        body of men banded together for purposes of bloodshed, and by an\n                        unprecedented exercise of power; that no law could possibly have been passed\n                        affecting my status as a citizen; that no law had been drawn up in writing,\n                        that none could have any validity; that everything had been done in\n                        disregard of the laws and of the usages of our ancestors, in a rash and\n                        turbulent manner, by violence and frenzy. But if that were a law, then it\n                        was not lawful for the consuls to refer the matter to the senate, nor for him himself to express his opinion\n                        upon it in the senate.

What? in the case of\n                        a dedication do not people inquire who says such and such a thing, and what\n                        he says, and how? Do you so confuse and mix up these matters, that whoever\n                        chooses can dedicate whatever he chooses, and in whatever manner he chooses?\n                        Who were you who performed the dedication? By what right did you do so? By\n                        what law? According to what precedent? By what power? When and where had the\n                        Roman people appointed you to manage that business? For I see that there is\n                        an old tribunitian law, which forbids any one to consecrate any house, land,\n                        or altar, without the order of the Roman people. Quintus Papirius, who\n                        proposed this law, did not perceive nor suspect that there would be danger\n                        lest hereafter the houses or possessions of citizens who had not been\n                        condemned might be consecrated. For that could not lawfully be done; nor had\n                        any one ever done such a thing; nor was there any reason why a prohibition\n                        should be issued, the effect of which appeared likely to be not so much to\n                        deter people from an action as to remind them of it.  But because buildings were consecrated,I do\n                        not mean the licenses of private persons, but those which are called sacred\n                        buildings,and because lands were consecrated,  not in\n                        such a way that any one who chose might consecrate our farms, but that a\n                        general might consecrate lands taken from the enemy; and because altars were\n                        erected, which carried with them a degree of sanctity to the place in which\n                        they were consecrated; he forbade all these things to be done unless the\n                        people ordered them. And if your interpretation of these edicts be that they\n                        were framed with reference to our houses and lands, I make no objection. But\n                        I ask, what law was passed that you should consecrate my house? where this\n                        power was given to you? and by what right you did it? And I am not now\n                        arguing about religion, but about the property of all of us; nor about the\n                        sacerdotal law, but about the common law."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "129", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "130", "@unit": "section"}], "pb": {"@n": "59"}, "#text": "The Papirian law forbids any building to be consecrated without the command\n                        of the people.

The one man was a censor of the greatest\n                        moderation and of the highest character; the other was a tribune of the\n                        people, of preeminent wickedness and audacity. That period was one of\n                        tranquillity, when the people enjoyed a full measure of liberty, and the\n                        senate all its legitimate authority; but your time was a time when the\n                        liberty of the Roman people was oppressed, and when the authority of the\n                        senate was destroyed.  The proposed\n                        measure was one full of justice, wisdom, and dignity. For the censor, to\n                        whose power (though you have abolished that) our ancestors chose to commit\n                        the decision respecting the dignity of each member of the senate, wished the\n                        statue of Concord to be in the senate-house, and wished also to dedicate the\n                        senate-house to that goddess. It was a noble intention, and one worthy of\n                        all praise. For he thought that by that measure he was enjoining that\n                        opinions should be delivered without party spirit or dissension, if he bound\n                        the place itself and the temple of public counsel by the religions reverence\n                        due to the goddess Concord. You, when you were keeping down the enslaved and\n                        oppressed city by the sword, by fear, by edicts, by privileges, by bands of\n                        abandoned men constantly present, and by the fear of the army which was\n                        absent and by threats of bringing it up, and by the assistance of the\n                        consuls, and by your nefarious agreement with them, erected a statue of\n                        Liberty in a mocking and shameless spirit, rather than with even any\n                        pretence to religion. He was dedicating a thing in the senate-house, which\n                        he was able to dedicate without any inconvenience to any one. You have\n                        erected an image not of public Liberty, but of licentiousness, on what I may\n                        call the blood and bones of that citizen  who of all others has\n                        deserved best of the republic.  And\n                        moreover he referred his design to the sacred college: to whom did you refer\n                        yours? If you deliberated at all, if you had anything which you wished to\n                        expiate, or any domestic sacrifice which you desired to institute, still\n                        according to the ancient practice of other men you should have referred the\n                        matter to the priests.

O ye immortal gods! How could you speak more plainly to\n                        us if you were living  among and associating with us?

If during the games a swarm of bees\n                        had come on the stage, we should think it necessary to send for the\n                        soothsayers out of Etruria; and shall we all see on a sudden such vast\n                        swarms of slaves let loose upon the Roman people, blocked up and shut in,\n                        and not be moved by that?

When these\n                        great men were celebrating games, they ordered all the slaves to depart from\n                        the theatre. But you turned slaves into one, and turned free men out of the\n                        other.

But in that house which you keep\n                        possession of after having slain Quintus Seius, a Roman knight and most\n                        excellent man, in the most open manner, I say that there was a shrine and\n                        altars. I will prove and establish this fact by the registers of the\n                        censors, and by the recollection of many individuals.

For some people think that it belongs to me to open the\n                        armoury of the temple of Tellus. They say that it is not long ago that it\n                        was open, and I recollect it myself. Now they say that the most holy part of\n                        it, and the place entitled to the greatest reverence, is occupied by a\n                        private vestibule.

Perhaps we are speaking of old stones; although, if\n                        this is not laid down in the civil law, still by the law of nature and the\n                        common rights of nations the principle has been established, that mortals\n                        cannot acquire a prescriptive right to anything as against the immortal\n                        gods."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "33", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "16", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "34", "@unit": "section"}], "pb": {"@n": "86"}, "#text": "But we will pass over all things of old date.

They are the men\n                        who resisted that pest  being removed from the republic; they\n                        prevented his being prosecuted; they resisted his being reduced to the\n                        condition of a private citizen.

I wish that that great man, who has contributed so greatly\n                        to my safety, may receive what I say in the same spirit as I say it. At all\n                        events, I will say what I feel. I declare to God, that there was no time\n                        that fellow appeared to be detracting so much from his exceeding dignity as\n                        when he was extolling him with the most extravagant praises.  Was Caius Marius, I pray you, more illustrious\n                        when Caius Glaucia was praising him, or when he became angry afterwards and\n                        abused him?

But I do marvel\n                        that though the former conduct may have been pleasing to angry men, the\n                        other course should not have been odious to such good citizens.

Undoubtedly he extols him, and says, that he is the\n                        only man in the city worthy of the glory of this empire; and hints that he\n                        is an exceedingly great friend of his, and that they are entirely\n                        reconciled.  And although I do not exactly\n                        know what he means yet I am sure that, if he were a friend to Pompeius, he\n                        would not praise him. For, if he were his greatest enemy, what could he do\n                        more to diminish his credit? Let those, who were glad that he was an enemy\n                        to Cnaeus Pompeius, and who, on that account winked at his numerous and\n                        enormous crimes, and who sometimes even accompanied his unbridled and\n                        furious acts of frenzy with their applause, observe how quickly he has\n                        turned round. For now he is praising him; he is inveighing against those men\n                        to whom he previously sold himself. What do you suppose he will do if a door\n                        to reconciliation with him should become really open to him, when he is so\n                        eager to spread a belief in such a reconciliation?"}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "54", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "55", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "26", "@unit": "chapter"}], "pb": {"@n": "97"}, "#text": "What other dissensions among the nobles can I suppose are pointed out by the\n                        immortal gods?

Wherefore when the immortal gods\n                        warn us of the discords of the nobles, they speak of the dissensions between\n                        illustrious citizens who have deserved well of the republic.

It is for you and for your safety, O most illustrious and most\n                        virtuous citizens, that they see that it behoves them to consult and to\n                        provide.  Slaughter of the chief men is\n                        indicated; that is added which must inevitably follow the death of the\n                        nobles.

Lucius Sulla, a most noble and gallant\n                        consul, quarreled with Caius Marius, a most illustrious citizen. Each of\n                        these men, when defeated, fell so completely that the conqueror became a\n                        king. Cinna quarreled with his colleague Octavius. To each of these men\n                        prosperity gave kingly power, and adversity brought death. The same Sulla\n                        became victorious a second time.  And that\n                        time, beyond all question, he exercised regal power, though he\n                        re-established the republic.

But as that Cnaeus Plancius is a Roman knight, whose rank \n                        as such is of that antiquity that his father, his grandfather, and all his\n                        ancestors were Roman knights before him, and in a most flourishing\n                            prefecture occupied the\n                        highest position both for rank and influence; secondly, as he himself while\n                        serving in the legions under Publius Crassus as general, enjoyed a character\n                        of the highest respectability among a number of most accomplished men, Roman\n                        knights; as he was after that the chief man among his fellow-citizens, a\n                        most incorruptible and upright judge in many causes, a promoter of many\n                        companies, and president of some;if not only no fault has ever\n                        been found with him, but if the whole of his conduct has been universally\n                        praised; shall we still be told that such a father shall be an objection to\n                        a most honourable son, when he would be able by his authority, or, if not,\n                        by his interest, to protect a less honourable man, or one entirely\n                        unconnected with him?  He has\n                        at times, says he, said some very harsh\n                        things. Perhaps he may have spoken rather freely. But\n                        that speaking freely, as you term it, says he, is not\n                        to be borne. Are then those men to be borne who complain that\n                        they cannot bear the freedom of a Roman knight? Where are our old customs?\n                        Where is our equality of privileges?

Need I recount the abuse directed by the Roman knights against even\n                        the noblest men, or that of the harsh, ferocious, unbridled expressions of\n                        the farmers against Quintus Scaevola, a man superior to all others in\n                        genius, justice, and integrity?"}, {"pb": {"@n": "117"}, "milestone": {"@n": "34", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "Granius, the crier, replied to the consul Publius Nasica in the middle of the\n                        forum, when he, after a suspension of all judicial proceedings had been\n                        proclaimed, as he was returning home, had asked Granius why he\n                        was sad; was it because all the auctions were postponed?\n                        Rather, said he,  because they\n                        have sent back the ambassadors.

Could you say that Plancius was guilty of the\n                        depository of the money to be used in bribery? Men's ears would reject the\n                        assertion. No one would endure it. All would turn away from it. That he was\n                        a very acceptable man to the tribes? They would hear that willingly. We\n                        ourselves should not be afraid to allow that. For do not think, O\n                        Laterensis, that the effect of those laws which the senate has thought fit\n                        to establish concerning bribery has been to put an end to the recommendation\n                        of candidates to attentions being paid to electors, or to personal\n                        influence. There have always been virtuous men who have been anxious to have\n                        influence among the men of their own tribe.  Nor, indeed, has our order ever been so harsh towards the common people,\n                        as to be unwilling to have it courted by moderate liberality on our part.\n                        Nor are our children to be forbidden to pay attention to the men of their\n                        own tribe or to show regard for them or to canvass them on behalf of their\n                        friends, or to expect a similar service from them when they are themselves\n                        candidates for any office. For all these things are only acts of mutual\n                        kindness and politeness, and are sanctioned by ancient customs and\n                        precedent. That was on our conduct when the occasions of our ambition\n                        required it; and such we have seen to be the course of most illustrious men;\n                        and even  at the present day we see many men alive to the\n                        necessity of keeping up their interests. It was the dividing the men of a\n                        tribe into decuries, the classification of the whole people, and the attempt\n                        to bind men's votes by bribes, that provoked the severity of the senate, and\n                        the energetic indignation of all good men. Allege this, prove this, direct\n                        your attention to this point, O Laterensis, that Plancius divided the tribes\n                        into decuries, that he classified the people, that he was an agent with whom\n                        money was deposited, that he promised money, that he distributed it; and\n                        then I shall wonder at your not having chosen to use the weapons which the\n                        law has armed you with. For with judges taken from the men of our own tribe,\n                        I need not say we could not if those things were true, bear their severity,\n                        but we could not even look them in the face.  But, after having avoided this line of conduct, and\n                        declined having those men for judges, who, as they must have had the most\n                        certain knowledge of such conduct, were bound to feel the greatest\n                        indignation at it what will you say before those men who silently ask of you\n                        why you have imposed this burden upon them; why you have chosen them above\n                        all men; why you prefer having them to proceed by guesswork, rather than\n                        those men to decide who had means of knowing the truth?"}, "I, O Laterensis, say that Plancius himself is a popular man, and that he had\n                        to assist him in his canvass many men eager in his cause, who were also\n                        popular men.

And besides, he began to hold them\n                        very suddenly, contrary to any one's expectation; so that, even if any one\n                        had formed the design of committing bribery, he would never have had time to\n                        manage it.

And yet do you\n                        wonder that Plancius was elected aedile when it was not a small portion of\n                        the people, but the whole people that had declared their good-will towards\n                        him? when it was not a portion of one tribe, but the whole  which were prerogative  in his behalf?  And\n                        at that time if you, O Laterensis, had been inclined, or if you had thought\n                        it consistent with your gravity to do what many men of high birth have often\n                        done, who, having gained a great many fewer votes than they had expected,\n                        afterwards, when the  had been\n                        adjourned, have prostrated themselves, and, with broken spirits and in a\n                        humble tone, had addressed supplications to the Roman people, I do not\n                        question but that the whole multitude would have turned towards you.

I\n                        myself, in truth, have always striven most zealously, in the first place, to\n                        be worthy of honour; in the second place, to be considered so.

The\n                        same road, O Cassius, is open to Laterensis, the same path by virtue to\n                        glory.

Being a\n                        very learned man, he used to praise philosophers,I don't know\n                        which, and indeed he could not tell their names himself;but still\n                        he used to praise those above all others who were said to be beyond all the\n                        rest the admirers and panegyrists of pleasures: of what sort of\n                        pleasure,of pleasure enjoyed at what times and in what manner he\n                        never inquired but the name itself he devoured with all the energy of his\n                        mind and body. And he used to say that those same philosophers were right\n                        when they said that wise men do everything for the sake of themselves, that\n                        no man in his senses has any business to trouble himself about the\n                        government of the republic; that nothing is better than a life of ease, full\n                        of, and loaded with, all sorts of pleasures and he used to say that those\n                        men who said that men ought to regard their own dignity, and to consult the\n                        interests of the republic, and to have a regard in every action of life to\n                        duty and not to advantage, that men ought to undergo dangers on behalf of\n                        their country, and to encounter wounds and to seek even death for its sake,\n                        were crazy and mad.  And from these\n                        incessant and daily conversations of his, and because I saw who the men were\n                        with whom he lived in the more retired part of his house, and because his\n                        house itself (as I may say) smoked so as to emit a steam from his discourse,\n                        and to show what he was about, I made up my mind that nothing good was to be\n                        looked for from such a trifler; but at the same time certainly that no evil\n                        need be feared. But the fact is, O judges, that, if you give a sword to a\n                        little child, or to a powerless and decrepit old man, he himself by his own\n                        violence cannot injure any one, but still if the sword touches the  naked body of even the strongest man, it is possible that he\n                        may be wounded by the mere sharpness and power of the weapon; in like\n                        manner, when the consulship had been given as a sword to enervated and\n                        worn-out men, who, of their own strength, would never be able to wound any\n                        one, they, armed with the name of supreme command, murdered the republic.\n                        They openly made a treaty with the tribune of the people, to receive from\n                        him whatever provinces they chose, and an army, and as much money as they\n                        chose, on this condition,that they themselves were the first to\n                        hand over the afflicted republic in fetters to the tribune.

But when on a sudden an incredible\n                        multitude from the whole city, and from all , had assembled at the Capitol, they all decided that\n                        they should put on mourning garments and defend me in every possible way by\n                        their private resources, since the republic was destitute for the time of\n                        its public leaders. At the same time the senate was assembled in the temple\n                        of Concord, a temple which of itself recalled the recollection of my\n                        consulship, when the whole body in tears addressed this curled consul with\n                        entreaties; for the other rough and fierce-looking one was keeping himself\n                        at home on purpose.

For\n                        to whom could they address their entreaties, when all were in mourning\n                        alike, and when the fact of a man's not having changed his dress was a\n                        sufficient proof of his being an ill-disposed person? After this change of\n                        garments had taken place, and while the city was in such grief, I say\n                        nothing of what that tribune, that plunderer of all things both human and\n                        divine, proceeded to do; a fellow who ordered all the most noble youths, and\n                        the most honourable Roman knights who were eager to entreat him to ensure my\n                        safety, to attend at his house, and who then exposed them to the swords and\n                        stones of his troop of artisans. I am speaking now of the consuls, on whose\n                        good faith the republic had a right to rely.  Frightened out of his wits, he flies from the senate\n                        with a mind and countenance less agitated than it would have been a few\n                        years before, if he had fallen in with a crowd of his creditors. He convenes\n                        an assembly. He, the consul, addresses them in such a speech as even\n                        Catiline himself,  if he had been victorious, would never have\n                        delivered.

First of all, on that very day which was fatal to\n                        me and grievous to all good men, when I had torn myself from the embrace of\n                        my country and from your sight, O fellow-citizens, and when from fear of\n                        danger to you, not to myself, I had yielded to the frenzy, and wickedness,\n                        and treachery, and arms, and threats of one man, and had abandoned my\n                        country, which was the dearest of all things to me, out of affection for my\n                        country herself; when not only men but the very houses and temples of the\n                        city were lamenting  that misfortune which befell\n                        me,so horrible, so lamentable, and so sudden; when no one of you\n                        could bear the sight of the forum, or of the senate house, or of the light\n                        of day; on that very day, do I say? at that very hour, at that very same\n                        moment, at that very instant of ruin to me and to the republic, their\n                        provinces were decreed to Gabinius and to Piso.

And he willingly, such was his grief, and\n                        so great his regret for me, would have exposed his body to their weapons,\n                        not with a view of resisting them, but with the object of meeting death, if\n                        he had not preserved his life in the hope of my return. However, he endured\n                        some violence from those wicked robbers; and as he had come down for the\n                        purpose of begging  the safety of his brother from the Roman\n                        people, having been driven from the , he\n                        lay down in the place of the , and\n                        covered himself with the corpses of slaves and freedmen, and defended his\n                        life that day by the protection which night and flight afforded him, not by\n                        that of the laws or courts of justice. You\n                        recollect, O judges, that on that day the  was filled with the corpses of the citizens, that the\n                        sewers were choked up; that blood was wiped up out of the forum with\n                        sponges; so that all men thought that such a vast number and such a\n                        magnificent show of gladiators could not have been provided by any private\n                        individual, or plebeian, but must be the exhibition of some patrician and\n                        man of praetorian rank. Neither before\n                        this time nor even on this most turbulent day itself was there any word of\n                        accusation uttered against Sestius. But there was great violence used in the\n                        forum. No doubt of that. When was there ever greater? We have often seen men\n                        pelted with stones; not so often, but still too often have we seen swords\n                        but such great slaughter as this,such vast heaps of corpses piled\n                        up who ever beheld in the forum, except perhaps on that miserable day of\n                        Cinna and Octavius? With what animosity did the parties fight! For, indeed,\n                        seditious disturbances often arise from the pertinacity or firmness with\n                        which some magistrate has exercised his veto or from the fault and\n                        wickedness of some proposer of a law having held out hopes of great\n                        advantage or great bribes to the ignorant; they arise from the rivalry of\n                        the magistrates; they arise gradually from clamour at first, and afterwards\n                        from some division of the assembly it is unwillingly, and slowly, and seldom\n                        that acts of violence are resorted to. But who ever heard before of a\n                        sedition in the night, when not a word had been spoken, when no assembly had\n                        been summoned and when no law had been read?

There is a charge\n                        respecting gold, and one respecting poison. And in both of them one person\n                        is concerned. Gold is said to have been taken from Clodia; poison is said to\n                        have been sought for, for the purpose of being given to Clodia. All the\n                        other statements are not charges, but are rather pieces of abuse prompted by\n                        a petulant quarrel, than adduced as a part of a criminal investigation. To\n                        call a man an adulterer, an immodest man, a pimp, is abuse, not accusation.\n                        For there is no foundation for such charges; they have nothing to rest upon;\n                        they are mere abusive expressions poured forth by an accuser in a passion,\n                        without any authority.  Of these two\n                        charges I see the source, I see the author, I see the certain originator and\n                        mainspring. Gold was wanted; he received it from Clodia; he received it\n                        without any witness; he had it as long as he wanted it. I see here a great\n                        proof of some very extraordinary intimacy. Again, he wanted to kill her; he\n                        sought for poison; he tampered with every one with whom he could; he\n                        prepared it; he arranged a place; he brought it. Again, I see that a violent\n                        quarrel has sprung up between them, and engendered a furious hatred. Our\n                        whole business in this part of the case, O judges, is with Clodia, a woman\n                        not only of high rank, but also notorious; of whom I will say nothing except\n                        for the sake of repelling some accusation.  But you are aware, O Cnaeus Domitius, as a man of your eminent wisdom\n                        must be, that we have in this matter to deal with no one but her; for if she\n                        does not say that she lent the money to Caelius, if she does not accuse him\n                        and say that  poison was prepared by him for her, then we are\n                        acting wantonly and groundlessly, in mentioning the name of a mother of a\n                        family in a way so different from what is due to a Roman matron. But if, if\n                        you only take away that woman, there is no longer any charge against\n                        Caelius, nor have the accusers any longer any resources by which to attack\n                        him, then what is our duty as the advocates of his cause, except to repel\n                        those who pursue him?

For I have never thought it my\n                        duty to engage in quarrels with any woman, especially with one whom all men\n                        have always considered everybody's friend rather than any one's enemy."}, {"milestone": {"@n": "34", "@unit": "section"}, "pb": {"@n": "262"}, "gap": {"@desc": "* * *"}, "#text": "But still I will first put this question to her herself, whether she wishes\n                        me to deal with her strictly, and gravely, and according to old-fashioned\n                        notions of right and wrong; or indulgently, mercifully, and courteously? If\n                        I am to proceed in the old-fashioned way and manner of pleading, then I must\n                        summon up from the shades below one of those bearded old men,not\n                        men with those little bits of imperials which she takes such a fancy to, but\n                        a man with that long shaggy beard which we see on the ancient statues and\n                        images,to reproach the woman, and to speak in my stead, lest she\n                        by any chance should get angry with me.

Why have you been so intimate with him as to lend him\n                        gold, or so much an enemy of his as to fear his poison? Had you never seen\n                        that your father, had you never heard that your uncle, your grand-father,\n                        your great-grandfather, your great-great-grand-father, were all consuls?\n                             Did you not know, moreover, that you\n                        were bound in wedlock to Quintus Metellus, a most illustrious and gallant\n                        man, and most devoted to his country? who from the  first\n                        moment that he put his foot over his threshold, showed himself superior to\n                        almost all citizens in virtue, and glory, and dignity.

Was he a friend of your husband? Nothing of\n                        the sort. What then was the reason, except it was some folly or lust?  Even if the images of us, the men of your family, had no\n                        influence over you, did not even my own daughter, that celebrated Quinta\n                        Claudia, admonish you to emulate the praise belonging to our house from the\n                        glory of its women?

You have\n                        heard him before now, when he was acting as prosecutor; (I say this for the\n                        sake of defending him, not by way of boasting;) you have seen, your sagacity\n                        could not help seeing, his style of eloquence, his facility, his richness of\n                        ideas and language; and in that branch of study you saw not only his genius\n                        shine forth, which frequently, even when it is not nourished by industry,\n                        still produces great effects by its own natural vigour; but there was in him\n                        (unless I am greatly deceived by reason of my favourable inclination towards\n                        him) a degree of method implanted in him by liberal tastes, and worked up by\n                        care and hard labour.  And know, O judges, that those passions\n                        which are now brought up against Caelius as an objection to him, and these\n                        studies on which I am now enlarging, cannot easily exist in the same man;\n                        for it is impossible that a mind which is devoted to lust which is hampered\n                        by love, by desire, by passion, often with overindulgence, sometimes too by\n                        embarrassment in pecuniary matters, can support the labour; such as they\n                        are, which we go through in speaking; not merely when actually pleading, but\n                        even in thinking.

If he did not tell her, why\n                        was it that she gave it? If he did tell her, then she has implicated herself\n                        as an accomplice in the same wickedness. Did you dare to take gold out of\n                        your strong-box? Did you dare to strip that statue of yours of Venus the\n                        Plunderer of men of her ornaments? But when you knew for what an enormous\n                        crime this gold was required,for the murder of an\n                        ambassador,for the staining of Lucius Lucceius, a most pious and\n                        upright man, with the blot of everlasting impietythen your\n                        well-educated mind ought not to have been privy to so horrible an atrocity;\n                        your house, so open to all people, ought not to have been made an instrument\n                        in it.

And, in truth,\n                        I was waiting eagerly to see who those virtuous men were, who would be\n                        stated to have been witnesses of this poison having been so clearly\n                        detected. For none have been named as yet. But I have no doubt that they are\n                        men of very high authority indeed, as, in the first place, they are the\n                        intimate friends of such a woman; and, in the second place, they took upon\n                        themselves that share of the business,that, namely, of being\n                        thrust down into the baths; which she, even were she as powerful as she\n                        could possibly wish to be, could never have prevailed on any men to do,\n                        except such as were most honourable men, and men of the very greatest\n                        natural dignity. But why do I speak of the dignity of those witnesses? Learn\n                        yourselves how virtuous and how scrupulous they are. They lay in ambush in\n                        the baths. Splendid witnesses, indeed! Then they sprung out precipitately. O\n                        men entirely devoted to their dignity! For this is the story that they make\n                        up: that when Licinius had arrived, and was holding the box of poison in his\n                        hand, and was endeavouring to deliver it to them, but had not yet delivered\n                        it, then all on a sudden those splendid nameless witnesses sprung out; and\n                        that Licinius, when he had already put out his hand to give them over the\n                        box of poison, drew it back again, and, alarmed at that an expected onset of\n                        men, took to his heels. O how great is the power of truth! which of its own\n                        power can easily defend itself against all the ingenuity, and cunning, and\n                        wisdom of men, and against the treacherous plots of all the world."}, {"pb": {"@n": "277"}, "#text": "But how destitute of all proof is the whole of the story of this poetess and\n                        inventress of many fables!

U. C. 698. Before the new consuls were elected, the senate assembled\n                            to deliberate on what province should be allotted to them on the\n                            expiration of their year of office. The provinces about which the\n                            question really was were the two Gauls which Caesar had, and  and  which had been given to Lucius\n                            Calpurnius Piso Caesonius, and to Aulus Gabinius, the consuls of the\n                            year 696. Several senators had spoken when Cicero rose, and had all,\n                            except Servilius, advocated the taking one or both of the Gauls from\n                            Caesar, which was in fact what the senate was desirous to do, but\n                            Cicero, who had himself been treated with the greatest indignity by Piso\n                            and Gabinius, was anxious instead to get them recalled with some marks\n                            of disgrace, and to have their provinces assigned to the consuls, and he\n                            urged also that Caesar's command should be continued to him till he had\n                            finished the war which he was carrying on with such success and till he\n                            had settled the conquered countries. This was much against the wishes of\n                            the senate and even of the existing consuls, who were principally\n                            concerned in the matter so that Philippus reproached Cicero, and\n                            reminded him that he had received worse treatment from Caesar than he\n                            had even from Gabinius since Caesar had been the real author of the\n                            calamities which had befallen him. But Cicero replied that his object\n                            was not the satisfying of his own private resentment, but the promotion\n                            of the real interests of the republic; that Caesar was deserving well of\n                            his country, that if he remained in his province, he would soon reduce\n                            all  to subjection, but\n                            that Piso and Gabinius were only tyrannizing over and draining their\n                            provinces while they were objects of contempt to all foreign enemies.\n                            The result was that he brought the senate entirely over to this opinion,\n                            and they continued Caesar's command in  and recalled  and Gabinius from their provinces which were given\n                            to the new consuls."}}}, "body": {"milestone": [{"@n": "1", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "1", "@unit": "section"}], "p": [{"pb": {"@n": "286"}, "placeName": [{"@key": "tgn,1000140", "#text": "Syria"}, {"@key": "tgn,7006667", "#text": "Macedonia"}], "milestone": {"@n": "2", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "If any one of you, O conscript fathers, is waiting to see what provinces I\n                        shall propose to decree to the consuls, let him consider in his own mind\n                        what men I must think it most desirable to recall from the provinces; and\n                        then he will not  have any doubt what ought to be my\n                        sentiments, when he has once seriously thought what it is absolutely\n                        inevitable that they should be.

After the supplication mentioned here of fifteen days, one of\n                                twenty days was decreed to Caesar in honour of his victory over\n                                Vercingetorix; and from this time forward the senate appears to have\n                                increased the number of days out of compliment to the general, so\n                                that we find mention of supplications for forty and fifty days, (see\n                                    ,) and even sixty days.

I proposed and carried a supplication of fifteen days in\n                        Caesar's honour the bill being passed in the terms which I drew up. It would\n                        have been sufficient for the good of the republic to have had it last only\n                        the same number of days as the supplication in honour of Caius Marius. That\n                        could not have been accounted by the immortal gods a scanty thanksgiving\n                        which was as great as had heretofore been offered in the most important\n                        wars. Therefore that increased number of days was given to the dignity of\n                        the men.  And in respect of that, I, who\n                        as consul brought forward the motion, first, for decreeing a supplication of\n                        ten days to Cnaeus Pompeius after Mithridates had been slain and the\n                        Mithridatic war been terminated,I, in compliance with whose\n                        opinion it was that the ordinary number of days that a supplication in\n                        honour of a consul lasted was doubled (for you all agreed with me when,\n                        having had the letters of that same Pompeius read, and knowing that all wars\n                        both by sea and land were happily terminated, you decided a supplication of\n                        twelve days)I, I say, admired the virtue and greatness of mind of\n                        Pompeius in that, when he himself had hitherto been preferred to all other\n                        men in every sort of honour, he now was giving a more ample honour to\n                        another than he himself had received. Therefore, in that supplication which\n                        I proposed, the honour was paid to the immortal gods, and to the established\n                        usages of our ancestors, and to the welfare of the republic.

A little\n                        while ago, you derided Marcus Piso's desire for a triumph, from which you\n                        said that you yourself were far removed; for he, even if it was not a very\n                        important war which he had conducted, as you say that it was not, still did\n                        not think that an honour to be slighted. But you are more learned than Piso,\n                        more wise than Cotta.

And the truth is that you did not despise them,\n                        even though you may be wiser than Themista; but you shrank from\n                        exposing even your iron countenance to be chastised by the reproaches of the\n                        senate."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "64", "@unit": "section"}, {"@n": "27", "@unit": "chapter"}], "#text": "You see now, since I have been so much an enemy to myself as to compare\n                        myself to you, that my departure, and my absence, and my return, were all so\n                        far superior to yours, that all these circumstances have shed immortal glory\n                        on me, and have inflicted everlasting infamy on you.

O judges, weeping, as I now repeat them;\n                        but with the same unmoved countenance that you behold. For he says, he never\n                        did all the things which he had done for citizens who are ungrateful;\n                        ungrateful, he says, they are not. That they are timid and thinking too much\n                        of every danger, he does not deny. He says, that he treated the common\n                        people, and that multitude of the lower class which, while they had Publius\n                        Clodius for their leader, threatened the safety of all of you in such a way,\n                        in order to render all your lives more secure; that he not only subdued it\n                        by his virtue, but won it over at the expense of three estates which he\n                        inherited. Nor has he any apprehension that while he was conciliating the\n                        common people by his liberality, he was not also securing your attachment by\n                        his singular services to the republic. He says, that the good-will of the\n                        senate towards him has been repeatedly experienced by him in the times that\n                        have lately gone by; and that he shall carry with him, and ever retain in\n                        his recollection, the way in which you and all your order flocked to meet\n                        him, the zeal you showed in his behalf, and the kindness of your language to\n                        him, whatever may be the destiny which fortune allots to him.  He remembers, also, that the voice of the crier\n                        proclaiming his triumph, was the only thing wanting to him, but that he was\n                        declared consul by the unanimous vote of the people, and that was the great\n                        object of his ambition. And now if all these things are to go against him,\n                        it will be only the suspicion of guilt, not the reality of any crime, which\n                        has injured him. He adds this, which is unquestionably true; that brave and\n                        wise men are not in the habit of setting their hearts so much on the rewards\n                        for virtuous conduct as on the fact of their conduct being so; that he has\n                        never acted throughout his life in any but the most honourable manner, since\n                        there can be nothing better for a man to do than to deliver his country from\n                        dangers; that those men are happy for whom such conduct procures honour\n                        among their fellow-citizens,  but yet,\n                        that those men are not miserable who have exceeded their fellow-citizens in\n                        good deeds. Moreover, that of all the rewards of virtue, if one is to make\n                        an estimate of the different rewards, the most honourable of all is glory;\n                        that this is the only reward which can make amends for the shortness of\n                        life, by the recollection of posterity; which can cause us \n                        while absent, to be present when dead to be still alive; that this is the\n                        thing by the steps of which men appear to mount even to heaven."}, {"milestone": [{"@n": "36", "@unit": "chapter"}, {"@n": "99", "@unit": "section"}], "#text": "Concerning me, says he, the Roman people and\n                        all nations will be continually talking.

I do not quite understand what this charge\n                        means;whether Postumus is charged with having made an addition of\n                        one per cent to the tenth, as our own collectors are in the habit of doing,\n                        or whether he deducted that sum from the total amount of the tenths.

I add this consideration also: how can it be likely, that when the burden\n                        of the tributes was already so heavy, an addition of our thousand talents\n                        could he made to so large a sum which was to be collected? or that, when a\n                        man, a most avaricious man as you make him out, was to receive \n                        so large a reward, he would put up with a diminution of a thousand talents?\n                        For it was not like Gabinius, to give up so vast a portion of what he had a\n                        right to; nor was it natural for the king to allow him to impose so great an\n                        additional tax on his subjects.

For you, O Caesar, have, by\n                        preserving Marcellus, restored their dignity even to those Marcelli who are\n                        dead, and you have saved that most noble family, now reduced to a small\n                        number, from perishing.  You, therefore,\n                        justly prefer this day to all the splendid and innumerable congratulations\n                        which at different times have been addressed to you.

But in this exploit  you\n                        are the general, and you are your own sole comrade: and the act itself is\n                        such that no lapse of time will ever put an end to your monuments and\n                        trophies; for there is nothing which is wrought by manual labour which time\n                        will not sometime or other impair or destroy;  but this justice and lenity of yours will every day\n                        grow brighter and brighter, so that, in proportion as time takes away from\n                        the effect of your deed, in the same degree it will add to your glory. And\n                        you had already surpassed all other conquerors in civil wars, in equity, and\n                        clemency, but this day you have surpassed even yourself.

I know, therefore, that Tubero wished to remain at home; but there\n                        was a person who contrived matters in such a way, who put forth that most\n                        holy name of the republic so artfully, that even had his sentiments been\n                        different from what they were, he would not have been able to support the\n                        weight of his language.  He submitted to\n                        the authority of a most distinguished man, or, I should rather say, he\n                        obeyed him. He went off at the same time with those men who were already\n                        embarked in the same cause, but he made us journey slower than they.\n                        Therefore, he arrived in Africa when it was already occupied; and from this\n                        it is that the charge against Ligarius, or rather the enmity against him,\n                        has its rise. For if it be a crime in him to have wished to hinder you, it\n                        is a no less serious one for you to have wished to obtain Africa, the\n                        citadel of all the provinces, a land created for the purpose of waging war\n                        against this city, than for somebody else to have preferred obtaining it\n                        himself,and that somebody was not Ligarius. Varus kept saying,\n                        that he had the command there; the  he\n                        certainly had.  But however the case, as\n                        to that part of it may be, what weight is there, O Tubero, in this complaint\n                        of yours? We were admitted into the province. Well,\n                        suppose you had been admitted? was it your object to deliver it up to\n                        Caesar, or to hold it against Caesar?"}, {"milestone": {"@n": "24", "@unit": "section"}, "#text": "See, O Caesar, what licence, or rather what audacity, your liberality gives\n                        us.

When, says the prosecutor, you\n                        had come to the Luceian fort, and had turned aside to the palace of the king\n                        your entertainer, there certain place where all those things were arranged\n                        which the king had settled to offer you as presents. To this place he\n                        intended to conduct you on coming out of the bath, before you lay down; for\n                        there were armed men stationed in that very place on purpose to kill you.\n                        This is the charge; this is the reason why a runaway should accuse a\n                        monarch, a slave accuse his master! I, in truth, O Caius Caesar, at the very\n                        beginning, when the cause was originally laid before me, was struck with a\n                        suspicion that Philippus, the physician, one of the king's slaves, who had\n                        been sent with the ambassadors, had been corrupted by that young man. He has\n                        suborned the physician to act as informer, thought I; he will be sure to\n                        invent some accusation of poisoning.

What says the physician?  Not\n                        a word about poison. But in the first place, that might have been\n                        administered much more a in a potion or in food; in the second place, a\n                        crime is committed in that way with greater impunity, because when it has\n                        been done, it can be denied. If he had assassinated you openly, he would\n                        have brought upon himself not only the hatred of all nations, but their arms\n                        also. If he had slain you by poison, to be sure he never would have been\n                        able to conceal the action from the divine wrath of the Jupiter who presides\n                        over hospitality, but he might perhaps have concealed it from men. Are we,\n                        then, to suppose that that which he might have attempted in secret and have\n                        executed with great caution, he never entrusted to you who were a skillful\n                        physician, and, as he believed, a faithful servant and yet that he could\n                        conceal nothing from you with respect to arms and blood, and ambuscade? And\n                        how cleverly is the whole nation worked up!  It was your own good fortune, says he that fortune which always preserves\n                        you, which saved you then.
