On this account it is pretty evident, that by  Sallust could never mean the Greek  virtue or moral worth,' but that he had in his eye the well-known interpretation of Varro, who considers it  (De Ling. Lat. iv.), as denoting the useful energy which ennobles a man, and should chiefly distinguish him among his fellow-creatures.
