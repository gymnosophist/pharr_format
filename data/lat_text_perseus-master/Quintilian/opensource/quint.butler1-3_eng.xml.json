For a long time I\nresisted their entreaties, since I was well aware that\nsome of the most distinguished Greek and Roman\nwriters had bequeathed to posterity a number of\nworks dealing with this subject, to the composition\nof which they had devoted the utmost care.   This\nseemed to me to be an admirable excuse for my refusal, but served merely to increase their enthusiasm.\nThey urged that previous writers on the subject had\nexpressed different and at times contradictory\nopinions, between which it was very difficult to\nchoose. They thought therefore that they were\njustified in imposing on me the task, if not of\ndiscovering original views, at least of passing definite\njudgment on those expressed by my predecessors.\n   I was moved to comply not so much because I\nfelt confidence that I was equal to the task, as\n\n\n\nbecause I had a certain compunction about refusing.\nThe subject proved more extensive than I had first\nimagined; but finally I volunteered to shoulder a\ntask which was on a far larger scale than that which\nI was originally asked to undertake. I wished on\nthe one hand to oblige my very good friends beyond\ntheir requests, and on the other to avoid the beaten\ntrack and the necessity of treading where others\nhad gone before.   For almost all others who have\nwritten on the art of oratory have started with the\nassumption that their readers were perfect in all\nother branches of education and that their own task\nwas merely to put the finishing touches to their\nrhetorical training; this is due to the fact that they\neither despised the preliminary stages of education\nor thought that they were not their concern, since\nthe duties of the different branches of education\nare distinct one from another, or else, and this\nis nearer the truth, because they had no hope of\nmaking a remunerative display of their talent in\ndealing with subjects, which, although necessary,\nare far from being showy: just as in architecture it\nis the superstructure and not the foundations which\nattracts the eye.   I on the other hand hold that the\nart of oratory includes all that is essential for the\ntraining of an orator, and that it is impossible to reach\nthe summit in any subject unless we have first passed\nthrough all the elementary stages. I shall not therefore refuse to stoop to the consideration of those\nminor details, neglect of which may result in there\nbeing no opportunity for more important things, and\npropose to mould the studies of my orator from infancy, on the assumption that his whole education has\nbeen entrusted to my charge.   This work I dedicate\n\n\n\n\nto you, Marcellus Victorius. You have been the truest\nof friends to me and you have shown a passionate\nenthusiasm for literature. But good as these reasons\nare, they are not the only reasons that lead me to\nregard you as especially worthy of such a pledge of\nour mutual affection. There is also the consideration\nthat this book should prove of service in the\neducation of your son Geta, who, young though he\nis, already shows clear promise of real talent. It has\nbeen my design to lead my reader from the very\ncradle of speech through all the stages of education\nwhich can be of any service to our budding orator\ntill we have reached the very summit of the art.   I\nhave been all the more desirous of so doing because\ntwo books on the art of rhetoric are at present\ncirculating under my name, although never published\nby me or composed for such a purpose. One is a\ntwo days' lecture which was taken down by the boys\nwho were my audience. The other consists of such\nnotes as my good pupils succeeded in taking down\nfrom a course of lectures on a somewhat more\nextensive scale: I appreciate their kindness, but\nthey showed an excess of enthusiasm and a certain\nlack of discretion in doing my utterances the honour\nof publication.

The first essential for such an one is that he\nshould be a good man, and consequently we demand\nof him not merely the possession of exceptional\n\n\n\n\ngifts of speech, but of all the excellences of character\nas well.   For I will not admit that the principles of\nupright and honourable living should, as some have\nheld, be regarded as the peculiar concern of philosophy. The man who can really play his part as a\ncitizen and is capable of meeting the demands both\nof public and private business, the man who can\nguide a state by his counsels, give it a firm basis by\nhis legislation and purge its vices by his decisions as\na judge, is assuredly no other than the orator of our\nquest.   Wherefore, although I admit I shall make\nuse of certain of the principles laid down in philosophical textbooks, I would insist that such principles\nhave a just claim to form part of the subject-matter\nof this work and do actually belong to the art of\noratory.   I shall frequently be compelled to speak of\nsuch virtues as courage, justice, self-control; in fact\nscarcely a case comes up in which some one of these\nvirtues is not involved; every one of them requires\nillustration and consequently makes a demand on\nthe imagination and eloquence of the pleader. I\nask you then, can there be any doubt that, wherever\nimaginative power and amplitude of diction are required, the orator has a specially important part to\nplay?   These two branches of knowledge were, as\nCicero has clearly shown, so closely united, not\nmerely in theory but in practice, that the same men\nwere regarded as uniting the qualifications of orator\nand philosopher. Subsequently this single branch\nof study split up into its component parts, and\nthanks to the indolence of its professors was regarded as consisting of several distinct subjects.\nAs soon as speaking became a means of livelihood\nand the practice of making an evil use of the\n\n\n\n\nblessings of eloquence came into vogue, those who\nhad a reputation for eloquence ceased to study moral\nphilosophy, and ethics,   thus abandoned by the\norators, became the prey of weaker intellects. As\na consequence certain persons, disdaining the toil of\nlearning to speak well, returned to the task of\nforming character and establishing rules of life and\nkept to themselves what is, if we  make a\ndivision, the better part of philosophy, but presumptuously laid claim to the sole possession of the\ntitle of philosopher, a distinction which neither the\ngreatest generals nor the most famous statesmen\nand administrators have ever dared to claim for themselves. For they preferred the performance to the\npromise of great deeds.   I am ready to admit that\nmany of the old philosophers inculcated the most excellent principles and practised what they preached.\nBut in our own day the name of philosopher has\ntoo often been the mask for the worst vices. For\ntheir attempt has not been to win the name of\nphilosopher by virtue and the earnest search for\nwisdom; instead they have sought to disguise the\ndepravity of their characters by the assumption\nof a stern and austere mien accompanied by the\nwearing of a garb differing from that of their fellow\nmen.   Now as a matter of fact we all of us frequently\nhandle those themes which philosophy claims for its\nown. Who, short of being an utter villain, does not\nspeak of justice, equity and virtue? Who (and even\ncommon country-folk are no exception) does not\nmake some inquiry into the causes of natural phenomena? As for the special uses and distinctions of\nwords, they should be a subject of study common to\nall who give any thought to the meaning of language.\n\n\n\n   But it is surely the orator who will have the greatest\nmastery of all such departments of knowledge and\nthe greatest power to express it in words. And if ever\nhe had reached perfection, there would be no need\nto go to the schools of philosophy for the precepts of\nvirtue. As things stand, it is occasionally necessary\nto have recourse to those authors who have, as I\nsaid above, usurped the better part of the art of\noratory after its desertion by the orators and to\ndemand back what is ours by right, not with a view\nto appropriating their discoveries, but to show them\nthat they have appropriated what in truth belonged\nto others.   Let our ideal orator then be such as to\nhave a genuine title to the name of philosopher: it\nis not sufficient that he should be blameless in point\nof character (for I cannot agree with those who hold\nthis opinion): he must also be a thorough master of\nthe science and the art of speaking, to an extent\nthat perhaps no orator has yet attained.   Still we\nmust none the less follow the ideal, as was done by\nnot a few of the ancients, who, though they refused\nto admit that the perfect sage had yet been found,\nnone the less handed down precepts of wisdom for\nthe use of posterity.   Perfect eloquence is assuredly\na reality, which is not beyond the reach of human\nintellect. Even if we fail to reach it, those whose\naspirations are highest, will attain to greater heights\nthan those who abandon themselves to premature\ndespair of ever reaching the goal and halt at the\nvery foot of the ascent."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.17"}, {"@id": "p.19"}], "#text": "I have therefore all the juster claim to indulgence,\nif I refuse to pass by those minor details which are\nnone the less essential to my task.

It is above all things necessary that our future orator, who will have to live\nin the utmost publicity and in the broad daylight of\npublic life, should become accustomed from his\nchildhood to move in society without fear and\nhabituated to a life far removed from that of the\npale student, the solitary and recluse. His mind\nrequires constant stimulus and excitement, whereas\nretirement such as has just been mentioned induces\nlanguor and the mind becomes mildewed like things\nthat are left in the dark, or else flies to the opposite\nextreme and becomes puffed up with empty conceit;\nfor he who has no standard of comparison by which\nto judge his own powers will necessarily rate them\ntoo high.   Again when the fruits of his study have\nto be displayed to the public gaze, our recluse is\nblinded by the sun's glare, and finds everything new\nand unfamiliar, for though he has learnt what is required to be done in public, his learning is but the\ntheory of a hermit.   I say nothing of friendships\nwhich endure unbroken to old age having acquired\nthe binding force of a sacred duty: for initiation\nin the same studies has all the sanctity of initiation\nin the same mysteries of religion. And where shall\nhe acquire that instinct which we call common\nfeeling, if he secludes himself from that intercourse\nwhich is natural not merely to mankind but even to\ndumb animals?   Further, at home he can only learn\nwhat is taught to himself, while at school he will\nlearn what is taught others as well. He will hear\nmany merits praised and many faults corrected every\nday: he will derive equal profit from hearing the\nindolence of a comrade rebuked or his industry\ncommended.   Such praise will incite him to\n\n\n\nemulation, he will think it a disgrace to be outdone by\nhis contemporaries and a distinction to surpass his\nseniors. All such incentives provide a valuable\nstimulus, and though ambition may be a fault in\nitself, it is often the mother of virtues.   I remember\nthat my own masters had a practice which was not\nwithout advantages. Having distributed the boys\nin classes, they made the order in which they were\nto speak depend on their ability, so that the boy\nwho had made most progress in his studies had the\nprivilege of declaiming first.   The performances\non these occasions were criticised. To win commendation was a tremendous honour, but the prize\nmost eagerly coveted was to be the leader of the\nclass. Such a position was not permanent. Once a\nmonth the defeated competitors were given a fresh\nopportunity of competing for the prize. Consequently success did not lead the victor to relax his\nefforts, while the vexation caused by defeat served\nas an incentive to wipe out the disgrace.   I will\nventure to assert that to the best of my memory\nthis practice did more to kindle our oratorical ambitions than all the exhortations of our instructors,\nthe watchfulness of our  and the prayers of\nour parents.   Further while emulation promotes\nprogress in the more advanced pupils, beginners who\nare still of tender years derive greater pleasure from\nimitating their comrades than their masters, just\nbecause it is easier. For children still in the elementary stages of education can scarce dare hope to\nreach that complete eloquence which they understand to be their goal: their ambition will not soar\nso high, but they will imitate the vine which has to\ngrasp the lower branches of the tree on which it is\n\n\n\n\ntrained before it can reach the topmost boughs.   So\ntrue is this that it is the master's duty as well, if he\nis engaged on the task of training unformed minds\nand prefers practical utility to a more ambitious\nprogramme, not to burden his pupils at once with\ntasks to which their strength is unequal, but to curb\nhis energies and refrain from talking over the heads\nof his audience.   Vessels with narrow mouths will\nnot receive liquids if too much be poured into them\nat a time, but are easily filled if the liquid is admitted in a gentle stream or, it may be, drop by\ndrop; similarly you must consider how much a\nchild's mind is capable of receiving: the things\nwhich are beyond their grasp will not enter their\nminds, which have not opened out sufficiently to\ntake them in.   It is a good thing therefore that a\nboy should have companions whom he will desire\nfirst to imitate and then to surpass: thus he will be\nled to aspire to higher achievement.

Ignorance of\nphilosophy is an equal drawback, since there are\nnumerous passages in almost every poem based on\nthe most intricate questions of natural philosophy,\nwhile among the Greeks we have Empedocles and\namong our own poets Varro and Lucretius, all of\n\n\n\n\nwhom have expounded their philosophies in verse.\n   No small powers of eloquence also are required to\nenable the teacher to speak appropriately and\nfluently on the various points which have just been\nmentioned. For this reason those who criticise the\nart of teaching literature as trivial and lacking in\nsubstance put themselves out of court. Unless the\nfoundations of oratory are well and truly laid by\nthe teaching of literature, the superstructure will\ncollapse.

These\nblemishes are however pardoned at times, because\nwe have become accustomed to them or because they\nhave age or authority in their favour or are near akin\nto positive excellences, since it is often difficult to distinguish such blemishes from figures of speech.1 The\nteacher therefore, that such slippery customers may\nnot elude detection, must seek to acquire a delicate\ndiscrimination; but of this I will speak later when\nI come to discuss figures of speech.   For the present\nI will define  as an offence occurring in\nconnexion with single words. Some of my readers\nmay object that such a topic is beneath the dignity\nof so ambitious a work. But who does not know\nthat some  occur in writing, others in\nspeaking? For although what is incorrect in\nwriting will also be incorrect in speech, the converse\nis not necessarily true, inasmuch as mistakes in\nwriting are caused by addition or omission, substitution or transposition, while mistakes in speaking are\ndue to separation or combination of syllables, to\naspiration or other errors of sound.   Trivial as these\npoints may seem, our boys are still at school and I\nam reminding their instructors of their duty. And\nif one of our teachers is lacking in education and\nhas done no more than set foot in the outer courts\nof his art, he will have to confine himself to the\nrules published in the elementary text-books: the\n\n\n\n\nmore learned teacher on the other hand will be in a\nposition to go much further: first of all, for example,\nhe will point out that there are many different kinds\nof    One kind is due to race, such as the\ninsertion of a Spanish or African term; for instance\nthe iron tire of a wheel is called  though\nPersius uses it as established in the Latin language;\nCatullus picked up  (a box) in the valley\nof the Po, while the author of the  be\nhe Labienus or Cornelius Gallus, imported \nfrom Gaul in the sense of  As for\n which is Sardinian for a  it\nis introduced by Cicero merely as an object of derision.   Another kind of barbarism proceeds from the\nspeaker's temper: for instance, we regard it as barbarous if a speaker use cruel or brutal language.\n   A third and very common kind, of which anyone\nmay fashion examples for himself, consists in the\naddition or omission of a letter or syllable, or in the\nsubstitution of one for another or in placing one\nwhere it has no right to be.   Some teachers however,\nto display their learning, are in the habit of picking\nout examples of  from the poets and attacking the authors whom they are expounding for\nusing such words. A boy should however realize\nthat in poets such peculiarities are pardonable or\neven praiseworthy, and should therefore be taught\nless common instances.   For Tinga of Placentia, if\nwe may believe Hortensius who takes him to task for\nit, committed two  in one word by saying\n for  that is to say he substituted c\nfor  and transposed  and e. On the other hand\n\n\n\n\nwhen Ennius writes  where\nthe  is twice repeated, he is defended on\nthe plea of poetic licence.   Substitution is however\nsometimes admitted even in prose, as for instance\nwhen Cicero speaks of the army of  is\nlocally styled  while the number of authors\nwho have been guilty of transposition in writing\n for  has succeeded in standardising the error. Similar instances may be quoted.\nIf  be regarded as the correct form, we must\nremember that Sisenna said  and that many\nhave followed him on the ground of analogy: on\nthe other hand, if  is the correct form, we\nmust remember that  has the support of\ncurrent usage.   And yet our fat fool, the fashionable\nschoolmaster, will regard one of these forms as an\nexample of omission or the other as an instance\nof addition. Again there are words which when\nused separately are undoubtedly incorrect, but\nwhen used in conjunction excite no unfavourable\ncomment.   For instance  and  are \nand differ in gender, but the words \nand  have persisted in common parlance\ndown to our own day, and Messala shows that the\npractice is correct.   It may perhaps seem absurd to\nsay that a  which is an error in a single\nword, may be made, like a  by errors in\nconnexion with number or gender. But take on the\none hand  (stairs) and  (which literally\nmeans a twig, but is used in the sense of broom)\nand on the other hand  (barley) and \n(mead): here we have substitution, omission and\naddition of letters, but the blemish consists in the\nformer case merely in the use of singular for plural,\n\n\n\n\nin the latter of plural for singular. Those on the\nother hand who have used the word  are guilty\nof a mistake in gender.

This practice,\nhowever, they restrict almost entirely to adverbs\nand pronouns; in other cases they follow the old\nusage.   Personally I think that in such phrases\nas these the circumstances are almost entirely altered\nby the fact that we join two words together. For\nwhen I say  I pronounce the phrase as\none word, concealing the fact that it is composed of\ntwo, consequently it contains but one acute accent,\nas though it were a single word. The same thing\noccurs in the phrase    It\nsometimes happens that the accent is altered by\nthe metre as in pecudes pictaeque volucres; for I shall\nread  with the acute on the middle syllable,\nbecause, although that syllable is short by nature, it\nis long by position: else the last two syllables\nwould form an iambus, which its position in the\nhexameter does not allow.   But these same words,\nif separated, will form no exception to the rule: or\nif the custom under discussion prevails, the old law\n\n\n\n\nof the language will disappear. (This law is more\ndifficult for the Greeks to observe, because they\nhave several dialects, as they call them, and what is\nwrong in one may be right in another.) But with us\nthe rule is simplicity itself.   For in every word\nthe acute accent is restricted to three syllables,\nwhether these be the only syllables in the word or\nthe three last, and will fall either on the penultimate\nor the antepenultimate. The middle of the three\nsyllables of which I speak will be acute or circumflexed, if long, while if it be short, it will have a\ngrave accent and the acute will be thrown back to\nthe preceding syllable, that is to say the antepenultimate.   Every word has an acute accent, but\nnever more than one. Further the acute never falls\non the last syllable and therefore in dissyllabic words\nmarks the first syllable. Moreover the acute accent\nand the circumflex are never found in one and the\nsame word, since the circumflex itself contains an\nacute accent. Neither the circumflex nor the acute,\ntherefore, will ever be found in the last syllable of\na Latin word, with this exception, that monosyllables\nmust either be acute or circumflexed; otherwise we\nshould find words without an acute accent at all.\n   There are also faults of sound, which we cannot reproduce in writing, as they spring from defects of the\nvoice and tongue. The Greeks who are happier in\ninventing names than we are call them iotacisms,\nlambdacisms,  (attenuations) and  (broadenings); they also use the term \nwhen the voice seems to proceed from the depths of\nthe mouth.   There are also certain peculiar and\nindescribable sounds for which we sometimes take\nwhole nations to fault. To sum up then, if all the\nfaults of which we have just spoken be avoided,\n\n\n\n\nwe shall be in possession of the Greek \nthat is to say, an exact and pleasing articulation; for\nthat is what we mean when we speak of correct\npronunciation."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "34"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "35"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "36"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "37"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "38"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "39"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "40"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "41"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "42"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "43"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "44"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "45"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "46"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "47"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "48"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "49"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "50"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "51"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "52"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "53"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "54"}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "amarae corticis"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "medio cortice"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "amari corticis"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "media cortice."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "uenite,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "abi"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "discede?"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "barbarisms: solecisms"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "nam enim, de susum, in Alexandriam;"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ambulo viam, Aegypto\nvenio,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ne hoc fecit:"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "quoque ego, enim hoc voluit, aulem non habuit."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "igitur"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "pleonasm,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ellipse,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "anastrophe:"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "anastrophe"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "hyperbaton"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecisms"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "scripsere"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "legere,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "male merere"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "male mereris."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "devenere locos,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "conticuere omnes"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "consedere duces"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "dixere,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "tenuere arcem Sabini"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "in adversum Romani\nsubiere?"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Orator"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecisms"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecisms"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "vice versa."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecisms"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "magnum peculiolum"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism;"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecisms"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecisms"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Solecisms"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "genus,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "species"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "genus."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "an"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "aut"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "hic"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ille sit"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ne"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "non"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "non feceris"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ne feceris,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "intro"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "intus"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "eo intus"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "intro sum"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "tragoedia Thyestes"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "ludi Floralia"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Megalensia"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "figures"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecism."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "solecisms;"}], "note": [{"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Ecl."}, "#text": "vi. 62."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Georg."}, "#text": "ii. 74."}, {"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "i.e. nam"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "enim;

I do\nnot entirely concur with this view nor yet do I\n\n\n\nwholly dissent. I admit that a  may occur\nin a single word, but with this proviso: there must\nbe something else equivalent to another word, to\nwhich the word, in which the error lies, can be\nreferred, so that the  arises from the faulty\nconnexion of those symbols by which facts are expressed and purpose indicated.   To avoid all suspicion of quibbling, I will say that a  may\noccur in one word, but never in a word in isolation.\nThere is, however, some controversy as to the\nnumber and nature of the different kinds of \nThose who have dealt with the subject most fully\nmake a fourfold division, identical with that which\nis made in the case of  are\nbrought about by addition, for instance in phrases\nsuch as    by\nomission, in phrases such as  or  and by transposition as in\n Under\nthis last head comes the question whether  can\nbe placed first in a sentence: for I note that authors\nof the first rank disagree on this point, some of\nthem frequently placing it in that position, others\nnever.   Some distinguish these three classes of\nerror from the  styling addition a \nomission an  and transposition  and\nthey assert that if  is a solecism, \nmight also be so called.   About substitution, that is\nwhen one word is used instead of another, there is\nno dispute. It is an error which we may detect in\nconnexion with all the parts of speech, but most\nfrequently in the verb, because it has greater variety\n\n\n\nthan any other: consequently in connexion with the\nverb we get  of gender, tense, person and\nmood (or  or  if you prefer either\nof these terms), be these types of error six in number,\nas some assert, or eight as is insisted by others (for\nthe number of the forms of solecism will depend on\nthe number of subdivisions which you assign to the\nparts of speech of which we have just spoken).\nFurther there are solecisms of number;   now Latin\nhas two numbers, singular and plural, while Greek\npossesses a third, namely the dual. There have\nhowever been some who have given us a dual as\nwell in words such as  and  in which\nas a matter of fact the final syllable has been\nsoftened to avoid harshness, just as in old writers\nwe find  for  Consequently\nwhat they assert to be a dual is concerned solely\nwith this one class of termination, whereas in Greek\nit is found throughout the whole structure of the\nverb and in nouns as well, though even then it is\nbut rarely used.   But we find not a trace of such a\nusage in any Latin author. On the contrary phrases\nsuch as   and\n clearly prove that they have nothing to do with the dual. Moreover  although Antonius Rufus cites it as proof to the\ncontrary, is often used by the usher in the courts to\ndenote more than two advocates.   Again, does not\nLivy near the beginning of his first book write\n and later  But I can produce still better authority.\nFor Cicero in his  says,    Similarly in vocables and\nnouns  occur in connexion with gender,\nnumber and more especially case, by substitution\nof one for another. To these may be added\n in the use of comparatives and superlatives,\nor the employment of patronymics instead of\npossessives and    As for  connected\nwith expressions of quantity, there are some who\nwill regard phrases such as  as a\nsolecism, because the diminutive is used instead of\nthe ordinary noun, which implies no diminution. I\nthink I should call it a misuse of the diminutive rather\nthan a  for it is an error of sense, whereas\nsolecisms are not errors of sense, but rather faulty\ncombinations of words.   As regards participles,\n occur in case and gender as with nouns, in\ntense as with verbs, and in number as in both.\nThe pronoun admits of  in gender, number\nand case.    also occur with great frequency in connexion with parts of speech: but\na bare statement on this point is not sufficient,\nas it may lead a boy to think that such error\nconsists only in the substitution of one part of\nspeech for another, as for instance if a verb is\nplaced where we require a noun, or an adverb takes\nthe place of a pronoun and so on.   For there are\nsome nouns which are cognate, that is to say of the\nsame  and he who uses the wrong  in\nconnexion with one of these will be guilty of the\nsame offence as if he were to change the \nThus  and  are conjunctions, but it would be\nbad Latin to say in a question  and ;    and\n\n\n\n are adverbs: but he who says  in lieu\nof  is guilty of a similar mistake, since one\nnegative denies, while the other forbids. Further\n and  are adverbs of place, but  and\n are solecisms.   Similar errors may be\ncommitted in connexion with the various kinds of\npronouns, interjections and prepositions. It is also\na  if there is a disagreement between what\nprecedes and what follows within the limits of a\nsingle clause.   Some phrases have all the appearance\nof a  and yet cannot be called faulty; take\nfor instance phrases such as  or\n and : although these are\nnever found in later times, they are the rule in\nancient writers. We will therefore style them \nand, though their use is more frequent in poets, will\nnot deny their employment even to orators.

Foreign words, like our population\nand our institutions, have come to us from practically\nevery nation upon earth.   I pass by words of Tuscan,\nSabine and Praenestine origin; for though Lucilius\nattacks Vettius for using them, and Pollio reproves\nLivy for his lapses into the dialect of Padua, I may be\nallowed to regard all such words as of native origin.\nMany Gallic words have become current coin,   such\nas  (chariot) and  (four-wheeled\nwagon) of which Cicero uses the former and Horace\nthe latter.

But this distinction between\nnative and foreign words has reference chiefly to\nGreek. For Latin is largely derived from that\nlanguage, and we use words which are admittedly\nGreek to express things for which we have no Latin\nequivalent. Similiarly they at tines borrow words\nfrom us. In this connexion the problem arises\nwhether foreign words should be declined according\nto their language or our own.   If you come across\nan archaistic grammarian, he will insist on absolute\nconformity to Latin practice, because, since we have\nan ablative and the Greeks have not, it would be\nabsurd in declining a word to use five Greek\ncases and one Latin.   He will also praise the\npatriotism of those who aimed at strengthening the\nLatin language and asserted that we had no need\nof foreign practices. They, therefore, pronounced\n with the second syllable long to bring it\ninto conformity with all those Latin nouns which\nhave the same termination in the nominative as\n\n\n\n They also insisted on the forms  and  (the last being adopted by Cicero),\nbecause they could not find any Latin nouns ending\nin    They were reluctant even to permit\nmasculine Greek nouns to end in  in the nominative case, and consequently in Caelius we find  and in Messala  and in\nCicero  So we need not be surprised\nthat the majority of early writers said  and\n   For, it was urged, if such words are spelt\nlike  and  the genitive\nshould terminate in  not in  On the same\nprinciple they placed an acute accent on the middle\nsyllable of  and  because Latin does\nnot allow an acute accent on the first syllable if it is\nshort and is followed by two long syllables.   So too\nwe get the Latinised genitives  and  together with many other analogous forms. More recent\nscholars have instituted the practice of giving Greek\nnouns their Greek declension, although this is not\nalways possible. Personally I prefer to follow the\nLatin method, so far as grace of diction will permit.\nFor I should not like to say  on the analogy\nof  although Gaius Caesar in deference to\nantiquity does adopt this way of declining it.

It is true\nindeed that scholars have attempted to justify certain\napparent anomalies: for example, when it is noted\nto what an extent  and  which resemble\neach other closely in the nominative, differ in the\nplural and in the other cases, they reply that they\nare not true parallels, since  is  while\n is masculine, although Varro in the book in\nwhich he narrates the origins of Rome, writes  following the precedent of Ennius and\nFabius Pictor.   The same scholars, however, when\nasked why  became  in the genitive, but  asserted that  was an absolute, \na relative noun. Further since both words derive\nfrom the Greek, they took refuge in the fact\n\n\n\nthat  provides a parallel to  and \nto    But how will they evade the difficulty\nthat feminine nouns whose nominative singular\nends in  never make the genitive end in \nand yet the genitive of  is  again\nnouns ending in  have various genitive terminations, but never end in  but yet we have\nno choice but to make the genitive of   Again what of those words which, although identical in the form of the nominative or present indicative, develop the utmost variety in their inflections.\nThus from  we get both \nfrom  both  and  Analogy itself\nadmits that verbs whose present indicative ends in\n-o have a great variety of perfect formations, as\nfor instance    For\n was not sent down from heaven at the\ncreation of mankind to frame the rules of language,\nbut was discovered after they began to speak and to\nnote the terminations of words used in speech. It\nis therefore based not on reason but on example,\nnor is it a law of language, but rather a practice\nwhich is observed, being in fact the offspring of\nusage.   Some scholars, however, are so perverse and\nobstinate in their passion for analogy, that they say\n in preference to  the form preferred\nby all orators, and  for  and \nfor  We may permit them to say  and  nor will we deprive\nthem of  as an alternative for    for\nfrom what else can  be formed? They may\nalso be allowed to point out that phrases such as\n and  involve a\n\n\n\ndouble solecism, since they change both case and\nnumber. Of course we were in blank ignorance\nof the fact and were not simply conforming to usage\nand the demands of elegance, as in the numerous\ncases, with which Cicero deals magnificently, as\nalways, in his Orator.   Augustus again in his letters\nto Gaius Caesar corrects him for preferring \nto  not on the ground that the former is not\nLatin, but because it is unpleasing and as he himself\nputs it in Greek  (affected).   Some hold\nthat this is just a question of  or correctness\nof speech, a subject to which I am far from being\nindifferent. For what can be more necessary than\nthat we should speak correctly? Nay, I even think\nthat, as far as possible, we should cling to correct\nforms and resist all tendencies to change. But to\nattempt to retain forms long obsolete and extinct\nis sheer impertinence and ostentatious pedantry.  I would suggest that the ripe scholar, who says \nwithout the aspirate and with a long e (for it comes\nfrom  and uses  and  in\npreference to the usual forms, should also add  and the like to his vocabulary.   His way is the\nright way. Who doubts it? But there is an easier\nand more frequented path close by. There is,\nhowever, nothing which annoys me more than their\nhabit not merely of inferring the nominative from\nthe oblique cases, but of actually altering it. For\ninstance in  and  the forms regularly used\nboth in writing and speech by the best authors,\nthese gentlemen change their second syllable to o,\nbecause their genitives are  and  and because  and  keep the u in the genitive. So\ntoo  and  give rise to similar controversy.\n\n\n\n   Their proceedings are just as arbitrary as if they\nwere to substitute an  in the genitives of \nand  on the analogy of  and \nThus Antonius Gnipho while admitting \nand even  to be correct, would have their\nplurals to be  and    If they\nwould only pay attention to the affinities existing\nbetween letters, they would realize that  makes\nits genitive  in precisely the same way that\n and  make their genitives\n not to mention other\nwords to which I have already referred.   Do not nouns\nwhich are similar in the nominative show, as I have\nalready observed, quite different terminations in the\noblique eases? Compare  and  and\n and  and a thousand others.\nAgain some nouns are not used in the plural, while\nothers are not used in the singular, some are indeclinable, while others, like  in the oblique\ncases entirely abandon the form of the nominative.\n   The same is true of verbs: for instance  disappears in the perfect and subsequent tenses. Nor\ndoes it matter greatly whether such forms are nonexistent or too harsh to use. For what is the genitive singular of  or the genitive plural of \nOr how will  and  form a perfect passive or\npassive participles.   Why should I mention other\nwords when it is even doubtful whether the genitive\nof  is  or  In view of what I\nhave said, it seems to me that the remark, that it\nis one thing to speak Latin and another to speak\ngrammar, was far from unhappy.

In the meantime let his\nmind be lifted by the sublimity of heroic verse,\ninspired by the greatness of its theme and imbued\nwith the loftiest sentiments.   The reading of tragedy\nalso is useful, and lyric poets will provide nourishment for the mind, provided not merely the authors\nbe carefully selected, but also the passages from\ntheir works which are to be read. For the Greek lyric\npoets are often licentious and even in Horace there\nare passages which I should be unwilling to explain\nto a class. Elegiacs, however, more especially erotic\nelegy, and hendecasyllables, which are merely sections\nof Sotadean verse (concerning which latter I need\ngive no admonitions), should be entirely banished, if\npossible; if not absolutely banished, they should be\nreserved for pupils of a less impressionable age. As to\ncomedy, whose contribution to eloquence may be of\nno small importance,   since it is concerned with every\nkind of character and emotion, I will shortly point\nout in its due places what use can in my opinion\nbe made of it in the education of boys. As soon as\nwe have no fear of contaminating their morals, it\nshould take its place among the subjects which it is\nspecially desirable to read. I speak of Menander,\nthough I would not exclude others. For Latin\nauthors will also be of some service.   But the\n\n\n\nsubjects selected for lectures to boys should be those\nwhich will enlarge the mind and provide the greatest nourishment to the intellect. Life is quite long\nenough for the subsequent study of those other subjects which are concerned with matters of interest\nsolely to learned men. But even the old Latin poets\nmay be of great value, in spite of the fact that their\nstrength lies in their natural talent rather than in\ntheir art: above all they will contribute richness\nof vocabulary: for the vocabulary of the tragedians\nis full of dignity, while in that of the comedians\nthere is a certain elegance and Attic grace.   They\nare, too, more careful about dramatic structure than\nthe majority of moderns, who regard epigram as the\nsole merit of every kind of literary work. For\npurity at any rate and manliness, if I may say so,\nwe must certainly go to these writers, since to-day\neven our style of speaking is infected with all the\nfaults of modern decadence.   Finally we may derive\nconfidence from the practice of the greatest orators\nof drawing upon the early poets to support their\narguments or adorn their eloquence.   For we find,\nmore especially in the pages of Cicero, but frequently in Asinius and other orators of that period, quotations from Ennius, Accius, Pacuvius, Lucilius, Terence,\nCaecilius and others, inserted not merely to show\nthe speaker's learning, but to please his hearers\nas well, since the charms of poetry provide a pleasant relief from the severity of forensic eloquence.  Such quotations have the additional advantage of\nhelping the speaker's case, for the orator makes use\nof the sentiments expressed by the poet as evidence\nin support of his own statements.

The question has consequently been raised\nas to whether they are necessary for this purpose.\n   What, say some, has the knowledge of the way to\ndescribe an equilateral triangle on a given straight\nline got to do with pleading in the law-courts or\nspeaking in the senate? Will an acquaintance with\nthe names and intervals of the notes of the lyre help\nan orator to defend a criminal or direct the policy\nof his country?   They will perhaps produce a long\nlist of orators who are most effective in the courts\nbut have never sat under a geometrician and whose\nunderstanding of music is confined to the pleasure\nwhich their ears, like those of other men, derive\nfrom it. To such critics I reply, and Cicero frequently\nmakes the same remark in his Orator, that I am\nnot describing any orator who actually exists or has\nexisted, but have in my mind's eye an ideal orator,\nperfect down to the smallest detail.   For when the\nphilosophers describe the ideal sage who is to be\nconsummate in all knowledge and a very god incarnate, as they say, they would have him receive\ninstruction not merely in the knowledge of things\nhuman and divine, but would also lead him through\na course of subjects, which in themselves are comparatively trivial, as for instance the elaborate\nsubtleties of formal logic: not that acquaintance\n\n\n\nwith the so called  or  problems\ncan make a man wise, but because it is important that he should never trip even in the\nsmallest trifles.   So too the teacher of geometry,\nmusic or other subjects which I would class with\nthese, will not be able to create the perfect orator\n(who like the philosopher ought to be a wise man),\nbut none the less these arts will assist in his perfection. I may draw a parallel from the use of antidotes\nand other remedies applied to the eyes or to wounds.\nWe know that these are composed of ingredients\nwhich produce many and sometimes contrary effects,\nbut mixed together they make a single compound\nresembling no one of its component parts, but\nderiving its peculiar properties from all:   so too dumb\ninsects produce honey, whose taste is beyond the\nskill of man to imitate, from different kinds of flowers\nand juices. Shall we marvel then, if oratory, the\nhighest gift of providence to man, needs the assistance\nof many arts, which, although they do not reveal or\nintrude themselves in actual speaking, supply hidden\nforces and make their silent presence felt?   \nit will be urged  Granted, but I am in quest of an orator.\n Yes, but we shall\nnever attain completeness, if minor details be\nlacking. And it will be agreed that though our\nideal of perfection may dwell on a height that is hard\nto gain, it is our duty to teach all we know, that\nachievement may at least come somewhat nearer\nthe goal.

Who is ignorant of the fact that\nmusic, of which I will speak first, was in ancient\ntimes the object not merely of intense study but of\nveneration: in fact Orpheus and Linus, to mention\nno others, were regarded as uniting the roles of musician, poet and philosopher. Both were of divine\norigin, while the former, because by the marvel of\nhis music he soothed the savage breast, is recorded\nto have drawn after him not merely beasts of the\nwild, but rocks and trees.   So too Timagenes\nasserts that music is the oldest of the arts related to\nliterature, a statement which is confirmed by the testimony of the greatest of poets in whose songs we read\nthat the praise of heroes and of gods were sung to\nthe music of the lyre at the feasts of kings. Does not\nlopas, the Vergilian bard, sing\n\n\n\nand the like? whereby the supreme poet manifests most clearly that music is united with the\nknowledge even of things divine.   If this be admitted, music will be a necessity even for an orator,\nsince those fields of knowledge, which were annexed\nby philosophy on their abandonment by oratory,\nonce were ours and without the knowledge of all\nsuch things there can be no perfect eloquence.\n   There can in any case be no doubt that some of\nthose men whose wisdom is a household word have\nbeen earnest students of music: Pythagoras for\ninstance and his followers popularised the belief,\nwhich they no doubt had received from earlier\nteachers, that the universe is constructed on the\nsame principles which were afterwards imitated in\n\n\n\nthe construction of the lyre, and not content merely\nwith emphasising that concord of discordant elements\nwhich they style harmony attributed a sound to the\nmotions of the celestial bodies.   As for Plato, there\nare certain passages in his works, more especially in\nthe  which are quite unintelligible to those\nwho have not studied the theory of music. But\nwhy speak only of the philosophers, whose master,\nSocrates, did not blush to receive instruction in playing the lyre even when far advanced in years?   It is\nrecorded that the greatest generals played on the\nlyre and the pipe, and that the armies of Sparta were\nfired to martial ardour by the strains of music. And\nwhat else is the function of the horns and trumpets\nattached to our legions? The louder the concert of\ntheir notes, the greater is the glorious supremacy of\nour arms over all the nations of the earth.   It was\nnot therefore without reason that Plato regarded the\nknowledge of music as necessary to his ideal statesman or politician, as he calls him; while the leaders\neven of that school, which in other respects is the\nstrictest and most severe of all schools of philosophy,\nheld that the wise man might well devote some of\nhis attention to such studies. Lycurgus himself, the\nfounder of the stern laws of Sparta, approved of the\ntraining supplied by music.   Indeed nature itself\nseems to have given music as a boon to men to lighten\nthe strain of labour: even the rower in the galleys\nis cheered to effort by song. Nor is this function of\nmusic confined to cases where the efforts of a number\nare given union by the sound of some sweet voice\nthat sets the tune, but even solitary workers find\nsolace at their toil in artless song.   So far I have\nattempted merely to sound the praises of the noblest\n\n\n\nof arts without bringing it into connexion with the\neducation of an orator. I will therefore pass by the\nfact that the art of letters and that of music were\nonce united: indeed Archytas and Euenus held\nthat the former was subordinate to the latter, while\nwe know that the same instructors were employed\nfor the teaching of both from Sophron, a writer of\nfarces, it is true, but so highly esteemed by Plato,\nthat he is believed to have had Sophron's works\nunder his pillow on his deathbed:   the same fact is\nproved by the case of Eupolis, who makes Prodamus\nteach both music and literature, and whose Maricas,\nwho was none other than Hyperbolus in disguise,\nasserts that he knows nothing of music but letters.\nAristophanes again in more than one of his plays\nshows that boys were trained in music from remote\nantiquity, while in the  of Menander\nan old man, when a father claims his son from him,\ngives an account of all expenses incurred on behalf\nof the boy's education and states that he has paid\nout large sums to musicians and geometricians.  From the importance thus given to music also originated the custom of taking a lyre round the company\nafter dinner, and when on such an occasion Themistocles confessed that he could not play, his education\nwas (to quote the words of Cicero)    Even at the banquets of our own forefathers\nit was the custom to introduce the pipe and lyre, and\neven the hymn of the Salii has its tune. These\npractices were instituted by King Numa and clearly\nprove that not even those whom we regard as rude\nwarriors, neglected the study of music, at least in so\nfar as the resources of that age allowed.   Finally\nthere was actually a proverb among the Greeks,\n\n\n\nthat the uneducated were far from the company of\nthe Muses and Graces.   But let us discuss the\nadvantages which our future orator may reasonably\nexpect to derive from the study of Music."}, {"note": ["Music includes dancing.", {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}], "#text": "Book chap. iii."}], "hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "rhythm"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "melody,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "eurythmic,"}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "tonarion"}], "milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "26"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "27"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "28"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "29"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "30"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "31"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "32"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "33"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.173"}, {"@id": "p.175"}, {"@id": "p.177"}], "quote": "creatures of the heavier Muse,", "#text": "Music has two modes of expression in the voice\nand in the body; for both voice and body require\nto be controlled by appropriate rules.

Now I ask you whether\nit is not absolutely necessary for the orator to be\nacquainted with all these methods of expression\nwhich are concerned firstly with gesture, secondly\nwith the arrangement of words and thirdly with the\ninflexions of the voice, of which a great variety are\nrequired in pleading.   Otherwise we must assume\nthat structure and the euphonious combination of\nsounds are necessary only for poetry, lyric and otherwise, but superfluous in pleading, or that unlike\nmusic, oratory has no interest in the variation of\narrangement and sound to suit the demands of the\ncase.   But eloquence does vary both tone and rhythm,\nexpressing sublime thoughts with elevation, pleasing\nthoughts with sweetness, and ordinary with gentle\nutterance, and in every expression of its art is in\nsympathy with the emotions of which it is the mouthpiece.   It is by the raising, lowering or inflexion of\nthe voice that the orator stirs the emotions of his\nhearers, and the measure, if I may repeat the term,\nof voice or phrase differs according as we wish\nto rouse the indignation or the pity of the judge.\nFor, as we know, different emotions are roused even\nby the various musical instruments, which are\nincapable of reproducing speech.   Further the\n\n\n\nmotion of the body must be suitable and becoming,\nor as the Greeks call it  and this can only\nbe secured by the study of music. This is a most\nimportant department of eloquence, and will receive\nseparate treatment in this work.   To proceed, an\norator will assuredly pay special attention to his\nvoice, and what is so specially the concern of music\nas this? Here too I must not anticipate a later\nsection of this work, and will content myself by\nciting the example of Gaius Gracchus, the leading\norator of his age, who during his speeches had a\nmusician standing behind him with a pitchpipe, or\n as the Greeks call it, whose duty it was to\ngive him the tones in which his voice was to be\npitched.   Such was the attention which he paid to\nthis point even in the midst of his most turbulent\nspeeches, when he was terrifying the patrician party\nand even when he had begun to fear their power.\nI should like for the benefit of the uninstructed,\nthose  as the saying\nis, to remove all doubts as to the value of music.  They will at any rate admit that the poets should be\nread by our future orator. But can they be read\nwithout some knowledge of music? Or if any of\nmy critics be so blind as to have some doubts about\nother forms of poetry, can the lyric poets at any\nrate be read without such knowledge? If there\nwere anything novel in my insistence on the study\nof music, I should have to treat the matter at\ngreater length.   But in view of the fact that the\nstudy of music has, from those remote times when\nChiron taught Achilles down to our own day, continued to be studied by all except those who\nhave a hatred for any regular course of study, it\n\n\n\nwould be a mistake to seem to cast any doubt upon\nits value by showing an excessive zeal in its defence.\n   It will, however, I think be sufficiently clear from\nthe examples I have already quoted, what I regard\nas the value and the sphere of music in the training\nof an orator. Still I think I ought to be more\nemphatic than I have been in stating that the music\nwhich I desire to see taught is not our modern music,\nwhich has been emasculated by the lascivious melodies of our effeminate stage and has to no small\nextent destroyed such manly vigour as we still\npossessed. No, I refer to the music of old which was\nemployed to sing the praises of brave men and was\nsung by the brave themselves. I will have none\nof your psalteries and viols, that are unfit even for\nthe use of a modest girl. Give me the knowledge\nof the principles of music, which have power to\nexcite or assuage the emotions of mankind.   We\nare told that Pythagoras on one occasion, when some\nyoung men were led astray by their passions to\ncommit an outrage on a respectable family, calmed\nthem by ordering the piper to change her strain to a\nspondaic measure, while Chrysippus selects a special\ntune to be used by nurses to entice their little charges\nto sleep.   Further I may point out that among the\nfictitious themes employed in declamation is one,\ndoing no little credit to its author's learning, in\nwhich it is supposed that a piper is accused of manslaughter because he had played a tune in the Phrygian mode as an accompaniment to a sacrifice, with\nthe result that the person officiating went mad and\nflung himself over a precipice. If an orator is\nexpected to declaim on such a theme as this, which\ncannot possibly be handled without some knowledge\n\n\n\nof music, how can my critics for all their prejudice\nfail to agree that music is a necessary element in\nthe education of an orator?"}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "34"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "35"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "36"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "37"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "38"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "39"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "40"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "41"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "42"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "43"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "44"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "45"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "46"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "47"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "48"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "49"}], "note": ["Geometry here includes all mathematics.", {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Class.\nReview,"}, "#text": "There was a separate symbol for each number, depending\non the hand used and the position of the fingers.

But it is not without\ngood reason that some of the greatest men have\ndevoted special attention to this science. Geometry\nhas two divisions; one is concerned with numbers,\nthe other with figures. Now knowledge of the former\nis a necessity not merely to the orator, but to any\none who has had even an elementary education.\nSuch knowledge is frequently required in actual\ncases, in which a speaker is regarded as deficient in education, I will not say if he hesitates\nin making a calculation, but even if he contradicts\nthe calculation which he states in words by making\nan uncertain or inappropriate gesture with his fingers.\nAgain linear geometry is frequently required in\ncases, as in lawsuits about boundaries and measurements.   But geometry and oratory are related in a\nyet more important way than this.   In the first\nplace logical development is one of the necessities\nof geometry. And is it not equally a necessity for\noratory? Geometry arrives at its conclusions from\ndefinite premises, and by arguing from what is certain\nproves what was previously uncertain. Is not this\njust what we do in speaking? Again are not the\nproblems of geometry almost entirely solved by the\n\n\n\nsyllogistic method, a fact which makes the majority\nassert that geometry bears a closer resemblance to\nlogic than to rhetoric? But even the orator will\nsometimes, though rarely, prove his point by formal\nlogic.   For, if necessary, he will use the syllogism,\nand he will certainly make use of the enthymeme\nwhich is a rhetorical form of syllogism. Further\nthe most absolute form of proof is that which is\ngenerally known as linear demonstration. And what\nis the aim of oratory if not proof?   Again oratory\nsometimes detects falsehoods closely resembling the\ntruth by the use of geometrical methods. An\nexample of this may be found in connexion with\nnumbers in the so-called pseudographs, a favourite\namusement in our boyhood. But there are more\nimportant points to be considered. Who is there\nwho would not accept the following proposition?\n But this is false, for everything depends on\nthe shape of the figure formed by these lines,   and\nhistorians have been taken to task by geometricians\nfor believing the time taken to circumnavigate an\nisland to be a sufficient indication of its size. For\nthe space enclosed is in proportion to the perfection\nof the figure.   Consequently if the bounding line\nto which we have referred form a circle, the most\nperfect of all plane figures, it will contain a greater\nspace than if the same length of line took the form\nof a square, while a square contains a greater space\nthan a triangle having the same total perimeter, and\nan equilateral triangle than a scalene triangle.   But\nthere are other points which perhaps present greater\n\n\n\ndifficulty. I will take an example which is easy\neven for those who have no knowledge of geometry.\nThere is scarcely anyone who does not know that\nthe Roman acre is 240 feet long and 120 feet\nbroad, and its total perimeter and the area enclosed\ncan easily be calculated.   But a square of 180 feet\ngives the same perimeter, yet contains a much\nlarger area within its four sides. If the calculation\nprove irksome to any of my readers, he can learn the\nsame truth by employing smaller numbers. Take a\nten foot square: its perimeter is forty feet and it\ncontains 100 square feet. But if the dimensions be\nfifteen feet by five, while the perimeter is the same,\nthe area enclosed is less by a quarter.   On the other\nhand if we draw a parallelogram measuring nineteen\nfeet by one, the number of square feet enclosed will\nbe no greater than the number of linear feet making\nthe actual length of the parallelogram, though the\nperimeter will be exactly as that of the figure which\nencloses an area of 100 square feet. Consequently the\narea enclosed by four lines will decrease in proportion\nas we depart from the form of a square.   It further\nfollows that it is perfectly possible for the space\nenclosed to be less, though the perimeter be greater.\nThis applies to plane figures only: for even one who\nis no mathematician can see that, when we have to\nconsider hills or valleys, the extent of ground enclosed\nis greater than the sky over it.   But geometry soars\nstill higher to the consideration of the system of\nthe universe: for by its calculations it demonstrates\nthe fixed and ordained courses of the stars, and\nthereby we acquire the knowledge that all things\nare ruled by order and destiny, a consideration\nwhich may at times be of value to an orator.   When\n\n\n\nPericles dispelled the panic caused at Athens by the\neclipse of the sun by explaining the causes of the\nphenomenon, or Sulpicius Gallus discoursed on the\neclipse of the moon to the army of Lucius Paulus to\nprevent the soldiers being seized with terror at what\nthey regarded as a portent sent by heaven, did not\nthey discharge the function of an orator?   If Nicias\nhad known this when he commanded in Sicily, he\nwould not have shared the terror of his men nor lost\nthe finest army that Athens ever placed in the field.\nDion for instance when he came to Syracuse to overthrow the tyranny of Dionysius, was not frightened\naway by the occurrence of a similar phenomenon.\nHowever we are not concerned with the uses of\ngeometry in war and need not dwell upon the fact\nthat Archimedes singlehanded succeeded in appreciably prolonging the resistance of Syracuse when it\nwas besieged.   It will suffice for our purpose that\nthere are a number of problems which it is difficult\nto solve in any other way, which are as a rule solved\nby these linear demonstrations, such as the method\nof division, section to infinity, and the ratio of increase in velocity. From this we may conclude that,\nif as we shall show in the next book an orator has\nto speak on every kind of subject, he can under\nno circumstances dispense with a knowledge of\ngeometry."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.185"}, "#text": "XI.

For in the first place it is a\nreasonable inference that a man blest with abnormal\npowers of eloquence will have made careful note of\nthe various steps by which eloquence is attained,\nand in the second place the reasoning faculty,   which\nis specially developed in learned men, is all-important\nin teaching, while finally no one is eminent in the\ngreater things of his art if he be lacking in the lesser.\nUnless indeed we are asked to believe that while\nPhidias modelled his Jupiter to perfection, the\ndecorative details of the statue would have been\nbetter executed by another artist, or that an orator\ndoes not know how to speak, or a distinguished\nphysician is incapable of treating minor ailments."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "9"}], "quote": ["Yes", "but surely you do not\ndeny that there is a type of eloquence that is\ntoo great to be comprehended by undeveloped\nboys?"], "pb": {"@id": "p.223"}, "#text": "it may be answered  Of course there is.

But in any case the arguments advanced\nin such cases are few in number and of a definite\ntype.

Or the legality of the proposal itself may\nbe impugned in various ways; it may for instance be\nurged that the law was not promulgated within\nseventeen days, or was proposed, or is being proposed on an improper day, or in defiance of the\ntribunicial veto or the auspices or any other legal\nobstacle, or again that it is contrary to some existing law.   But such points are not suitable to\nelementary rhetorical exercises, which are not concerned with persons, times or particular cases.\nOther subjects, whether the dispute be real or fictitious, are generally treated on the following lines.\n   The fault must lie either in the words or the\nmatter. As regards the words, the question will\nbe whether they are sufficiently clear or contain\nsome ambiguity, and as regards the matter whether\nthe law is consistent with itself or should be retrospective or apply to special individuals. The point\nhowever which is most commonly raised is the\nquestion whether the law is right or expedient.   I\nam well aware that many rhetoricians introduce a\nnumber of sub-divisions in connexion with this latter\nenquiry. I however include under the term \nall such qualities as justice, piety and religion.\nJustice is however usually discussed under various\naspects. A question may be raised about the acts\nwith which the law is concerned, as to whether they\n\n\n\ndeserve punishment or reward or as to the degree of\npunishment or reward that should be assigned, since\nexcess in either direction is open to criticism.   Again\nexpediency is sometimes determined by the nature\nof things, sometimes by the circumstances of the time.\nAnother common subject of controversy is whether\na law can be enforced, while one must not shut one's\neyes to the fact that exception is sometimes taken\nto laws in their entirety, but sometimes only in\npart, examples of both forms of criticism being\nfound in famous speeches.   I am well aware, too,\nthat there are laws which are not proposed with\na view to perpetuity, but are concerned with temporary honours or commands, such as the \nwhich is the subject of one of Cicero's speeches.\nThis however is not the place for instructions on\nthis topic, since they depend on the special circumstances of the matters under discussion, not on their\ngeneral characteristics."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "41"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "42"}], "note": [{"quote": "The causes of the\ndecline of oratory", "hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "De causis corruptae eloquentiae)."}, "#text": "Probably the lost treatise on  ("}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Or."}, "#text": "See Cic.  iii. 24, 93."}], "pb": {"@id": "p.247"}, "#text": "Such were the subjects on which the ancients as\na rule exercised their powers of speaking, though\nthey called in the assistance of the logicians as well\nto teach them the theory of argument.

The case with which\nthe speech selected for reading is concerned should\nthen be explained, for if this be done they will\nhave a clearer understanding of what is to be read.\nWhen the reading is commenced, no important\npoint should be allowed to pass unnoticed either\nas regards the resourcefulness or the style shown\nin the treatment of the subject: the teacher must\npoint out how the orator seeks to win the favour\nof the judge in his  what clearness, brevity\nand sincerity, and at times what shrewd design and\nwell-concealed artifice is shown in the statement of\nfacts.   For the only true art in pleading is that\nwhich can only be understood by one who is a\nmaster of the art himself. The teacher will proceed\nfurther to demonstrate what skill is shown in the division into heads, how subtle and frequent are the thrusts\nof argument, what vigour marks the stirring and\nwhat charm the soothing passage, how fierce is the\ninvective and how full of wit the jests, and in\nconclusion how the orator establishes his sway\nover the emotions of his audience, forces his way\n\n\n\ninto their very hearts and brings the feelings of the\njury into perfect sympathy with all his words.\n   Finally as regards the style, he will emphasise the\nappropriateness, elegance or sublimity of particular\nwords, will indicate where the amplification of the\ntheme is deserving of praise and where there is\nvirtue in a diminuendo; and will call attention to\nbrilliant metaphors, figures of speech and passages\ncombining smoothness and polish with a general\nimpression of manly vigour."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "10"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "11"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "12"}], "#text": "It will even at times be of value to read speeches\nwhich are corrupt and faulty in style, but still meet\nwith general admiration thanks to the perversity of\nmodern tastes, and to point out how many expressions in them are inappropriate, obscure, high-flown,\ngrovelling, mean, extravagant or effeminate, although\nthey are not merely praised by the majority of critics,\nbut, worse still, praised just because they are bad.

Secondly the opposite extreme must\nbe equally avoided: they must not be permitted to\nfall victims to the pernicious allurements of the\nprecious blooms produced by our modern euphuists,\nthus acquiring a passion for the luscious sweetness\nof such authors, whose charm is all the more attractive to boyish intellects because it is so easy of\nachievement.

Others have merely suggested a\nbare outline, and then when the declamations were\nover, have indicated the points missed by each\nspeaker and worked up certain passages with no less\ncare than they would have used, had they been going\nto stand up to speak themselves. Both practices\nhave their advantages, and therefore I will not give\neither the pre-eminence. But if we must choose one\nof the two, it will be found more profitable to point\nout the right road at the outset, and not merely to\nrecall the pupil from his error when he has already\ngone astray,   since in the first place the correction\nis only received by the ear, whereas when he is\ngiven a sketch of the various heads of the declamation, he has to take them down and think about\nthem: secondly instruction is always more readily\nreceived than reproof. Indeed those of our pupils\nwho have a lively disposition are liable in the\npresent condition of manners to lose their temper\nwhen admonished and to offer silent resistance.\n   That, however, is no reason for refraining from\nthe public correction of faults; for we must take\nthe rest of the class into account, who will believe\nthat whatever has not been corrected by the master\nis right.

The gifts of\nnature are infinite in their variety, and mind differs\nfrom mind almost as much as body from body.   This\nis clear from a consideration of the orators themselves, who differ in style to such an extent that no\none is like another, in spite of the fact that numbers\nhave modelled their style on that of their favorite\nauthors.   Many again think it useful to direct their\ninstruction to the fostering of natural advantages and\nto guide the talents of their pupils along the lines\nwhich they instinctively tend to follow. Just as an\nexpert gymnast, when he enters a gymnasium full of\nboys, after testing body and mind in every way, is\nable to decide for what class of athletic contest they\nshould be trained, even so, they say,   a teacher of\noratory after careful observation of a boy's stylistic\npreferences, be they for terseness and polish, energy,\ndignity, charm, roughness, brilliance or wit, will so\nadapt his instructions to individual needs that each\npupil will be pushed forward in the sphere for which\nhis talents seem specially to design him;   for nature,\nwhen cultivated, goes from strength to strength,\nwhile he who runs counter to her bent is ineffective\nin those branches of the art for which he is less\nsuited and weakens the talents which he seemed\nborn to employ.   Now, since the critic who is\nguided by his reason is free to dissent even from\n\n\n\nreceived opinions, I must insist that to my thinking this view is only partially true. It is undoubtedly necessary to note the individual gifts of\neach boy,   and no one would ever convince me\nthat it is not desirable to differentiate courses of\nstudy with this in view. One boy will be better\nadapted for the study of history, another for poetry,\nanother for law, while some perhaps had better be\npacked off to the country. The teacher of rhetoric\nwill distinguish such special aptitudes, just as our\ngymnast will turn one pupil into a runner, another\ninto a boxer or wrestler or an expert at some other\nof the athletic accomplishments for which prizes are\nawarded at the sacred games.   But on the other\nhand, he who is destined for the bar must study not\none department merely, but must perfect himself in\nall the accomplishments which his profession demands, even though some of them may seem too hard\nfor him when he approaches them as a learner. For if\nnatural talent alone were sufficient, education might\nbe dispensed with.   Suppose we are given a pupil\nwho, like so many, is of depraved tastes and swollen\nwith his own conceit; shall we suffer him to go his\nown sweet way? If a boy's disposition is naturally\ndry and jejune, ought we not to feed it up or at any\nrate clothe it in fairer apparel? For, if in some cases\nit is necessary to remove certain qualities, surely\nthere are others where we may be permitted to add\nwhat is lacking.   Not that I would set myself against\nthe will of nature. No innate good quality should be\nneglected, but defects must be made good and weaknesses made strong.   When Isocrates, the prince of\ninstructors, whose works proclaim his eloquence no\nless than his pupils testify to his excellence as a\n\n\n\nteacher, gave his opinion of Ephorus and Theopompus\nto the effect that the former needed the spur and the\nlatter the curb, what was his meaning?

For though he\nwill necessarily have a natural bent for some special\ndepartment of oratory, he will not feel repelled by\nthe others, and by sheer application will develop his\nother qualities until they equal those in which he\nnaturally excels. The skilled gymnast will once again\nprovide us with a parallel: if he undertakes to train\na pancratiast, he will not merely teach him how\nto use his fists or his heels, nor will he restrict\nhis instructions to the holds in wrestling, giving\nspecial attention to certain tricks of this kind,\nbut will train him in every department of the\nscience.

But before I begin to discuss\nthese, I must say a few words on the theory of\ndeclamation, which is at once the most recent and\nmost useful of rhetorical exercises.   For it includes\npractically all the exercises of which we have been\nspeaking and is in close touch with reality. As a\nresult it has acquired such a vogue that many think\nthat it is the sole training necessary to the formation\nof an orator, since there is no excellence in a formal\nspeech which is not also to be found in this type of\nrhetorical exercise.   On the other hand the actual\npractice of declamation has degenerated to such an\nextent owing to the fault of our teachers, that it has\ncome to be one of the chief causes of the corruption\nof modern oratory; such is the extravagance and\nignorance of our declaimers. But it is possible to\nmake a sound use of anything that is naturally sound.\n   The subjects chosen for themes should, therefore, be\nas true to life as possible, and the actual declamation\nshould, as far as may be, be modelled on the pleadings for which it was devised as a training.   For we\nshall hunt in vain among  and \nfor magicians and plagues and oracles and stepmothers more cruel than any in tragedy, and other\n\n\n\nsubjects still more unreal than these. What then?\nare we never to permit young men to handle unreal\nor, to be more accurate, poetic themes that they may\nrun riot and exult in their strength and display their\nfull stature?   It were best to prohibit them absolutely.\nBut at any rate the themes, however swelling and\nmagnificent, should not be such as to seem foolish\nand laughable to the eye of an intelligent observer.\nConsequently, if we must make some concession, let\nus allow the declaimer to gorge himself occasionally, as long as he realises that his case will be like\nthat of cattle that have blown themselves out with a\nsurfeit of green food: they are cured of their disorder\nby blood-letting and then put back to food such as\nwill maintain their strength; similarly the declaimer\nmust be rid of his superfluous fat, and his corrupt\nhumours must be discharged, if he wants to be\nstrong and healthy.   Otherwise, the first time he\nmakes any serious effort, his swollen emptiness will\nstand revealed. Those, however, who hold that\ndeclamation has absolutely nothing in common with\npleading in the courts, are clearly quite unaware of\nthe reasons which gave rise to this type of exercise.\n   For if declamation is not a preparation for the actual\nwork of the courts, it can only be compared to the\nrant of an actor or the raving of a lunatic. For what\nis the use of attempting to conciliate a non-existent\njudge, or of stating a case which all know to be\nfalse, or of trying to prove a point on which judgment will never be passed? Such waste of effort\nis, however, a comparative trifle. But what can be\nmore ludicrous than to work oneself into a passion\nand to attempt to excite the anger or grief of\nour hearers, unless we are preparing ourselves by\n\n\n\nsuch mimic combats for the actual strife and the\npitched battles of the law-courts?   Is there then no\ndifference between our declamations and genuine\nforensic oratory? I can only reply, that if we speak\nwith a desire for improvement, there will be no\ndifference. [ wish indeed that certain additions\ncould be made to the existing practice; that we made\nuse of names, that our fictitious debates dealt with\nmore complicated cases and sometimes took longer\nto deliver, that we were less afraid of words drawn\nfrom everyday speech and that we were in the habit\nof seasoning our words with jests. For as regards\nall these points, we are mere novices when we come\nto actual pleading, however elaborate the training\nthat the schools have given us on other points.   And\neven if display is the object of declamation, surely\nwe ought to unbend a little for the entertainment of\nour audience.   For even in those speeches which,\nalthough undoubtedly to some extent concerned\nwith the truth, are designed to charm the multitude (such for instance as panegyrics and the oratory\nof display in all its branches), it is permissible to\nbe more ornate and not merely to disclose all the\nresources of our art, which in cases of law should as\na rule be concealed, but actually to flaunt them\nbefore those who have been summoned to hear us.\n   Declamation therefore should resemble the truth,\nsince it is modelled on forensic and deliberative\noratory. On the other hand it also involves an\nelement of display, and should in consequence\nassume a certain air of elegance.   In this connexion\nI may cite the practice of comic actors, whose delivery is not exactly that of common speech, since\nthat would be inartistic, but is on the other hand not\n\n\n\nfar removed from the accents of nature, for, if it were,\ntheir mimicry would be a failure: what they do therefore is to exalt the simplicity of ordinary speech\nby a touch of stage decoration.

These\npersons, just because, thanks to their natural gifts,\nthey are regarded as brilliant performers and have,\nas a matter of fact, uttered much that deserves to\nbe remembered, think that, while most men share\ntheir careless habits, few come near them for talent.\n   Consequently they make it their boast that they\nspeak on impulse and owe their success to their\nnative powers; they further assert that there is no\nneed of proof or careful marshalling of facts when\nwe are speaking on fictitious themes, but only of\nsome of those sounding epigrams, the expectation of\nwhich has filled the lecture-room; and these they\nsay are best improvised on the spur of the moment.\n   Further, owing to their contempt for method, when\nthey are meditating on some future effusion, they\nspend whole days looking at the ceiling in the hope\nthat some magnificent inspiration may occur to\nthem, or rock their bodies to and fro, booming\ninarticulately as if they had a trumpet inside them\nand adapting their agitated movements, not to the\ndelivery of the words, but to their pursuit.   Some\nagain settle on certain definite openings long before they have thought what they are going to say,\nwith a view to using them as pegs for subsequent\nsnatches of eloquence, and then after practising\ntheir delivery first in silent thought and then\naloud for hours together, in utter desperation of\nproviding any connecting links, abandon them and\n\n\n\ntake refuge in one formula after another, each no\nless hackneyed and familiar than the last.   The\nleast unreasonable of them devote their attention not to the actual cases, but to their purple\npatches, in the composition of which they pay no\nattention to the subject-matter, but fire off a series\nof isolated thoughts just as they happen to come to\nhand.   The result is a speech which, being composed of disconnected passages having nothing in\ncommon with each other, must necessarily lack\ncohesion and can only be compared to a schoolboy's\nnotebook, in which he jots down any passages from\nthe declamations of others that have come in for a\nword of praise. None the less they do occasionally\nstrike out some good things and some fine epigrams,\nsuch as they make their boast.

Even a\ngladiator who plunges into the fight with no skill at\narms to help him, and a wrestler who puts forth the\nwhole strength of his body the moment he has got\na hold, is acclaimed by them for his outstanding\nvigour, although it is of frequent occurrence in such\ncases for the latter to be overthrown by his own\nstrength and for the former to find the fury of his\n\n\n\nonslaught parried by his adversary with a supple\nturn of the wrist.

Consequently the all-important\ngift for an orator is a wise adaptability since he is\ncalled upon to meet the most varied emergencies.\n   What if you should instruct a general, as often as he\nmarshals his troops for battle, to draw up his front in\nline, advance his wings to left and right, and station\nhis cavalry to protect his flank? This will perhaps be\nthe best plan, if circumstances allow.

Or again it may\nbe modified by the character of the enemy or the\nnature of the crisis by which he is faced. On one\noccasion he will fight in line, on another in column,\non one he will use his auxiliary troops, on another his\nlegionaries; while occasionally a feint of flight may\nwin the day. So, too, with the rules of oratory.   Is\nthe  necessary or superfluous? should it be\nlong or short? addressed entirely to the judge or\nsometimes directed to some other quarter by the\nemployment of some figure of speech? Should the\nstatement of facts be concise or developed at some\nlength? continuous or divided into sections? and\nshould it follow the actual or an artificial order of\nevents? The orator will find the answers to all these\nquestions in the circumstances of the case. So, too,\nwith the order in which questions should be discussed,\n\n\n\nsince in any given debate it may often suit one party\nbest that such and such a question come up first,  while their opponents would be best suited by another.\nFor these rules have not the formal authority of laws\nor decrees of the plebs, but are, with all they contain,\nthe children of expediency.

But it is often expedient and occasionally becoming to make some modification in the\ntime-honoured order. We see the same thing in\npictures and statues. Dress, expression and attitude\nare frequently varied.   The body when held bolt\nupright has but little grace, for the face looks straight\nforward, the arms hang by the side, the feet are\njoined and the whole figure is stiff from top to toe.\nBut that curve, I might almost call it motion, with\nwhich we are so familiar, gives an impression of action\nand animation. So, too, the hands will not always be\nrepresented in the same position, and the variety\ngiven to the expression will be infinite.   Some figures\nare represented as running or rushing forward, others\nsit or recline, some are nude, others clothed, while\nsome again are half-dressed, half-naked. Where can\nwe find a more violent and elaborate attitude than\nthat of the Discobolus of Myron? Yet the critic who\n\n\n\ndisapproved of the figure because it was not upright,\nwould merely show his utter failure to understand the\nsculptor's art, in which the very novelty and difficulty\nof execution is what most deserves our praise.   A\nsimilar impression of grace and charm is produced by\nrhetorical figures, whether they be \nor  For they involve a certain departure from the straight line and have the merit of\nvariation from the ordinary usage.   In a picture the\nfull face is most attractive. But Apelles painted\nAntigonus in profile, to conceal the blemish caused\nby the loss of one eye. So, too, in speaking, there\nare certain things which have to be concealed, either\nbecause they ought not to be disclosed or because\nthey cannot be expressed as they deserve.   Timanthes,\nwho was, I think, a native of Cythnus, provides an\nexample of this in the picture with which he won the\nvictory over Colotes of Teos. It represented the\nsacrifice of Iphigenia, and the artist had depicted an\nexpression of grief on the face of Calchas and of still\ngreater grief on that of Ulysses, while he had given\nMenelaus an agony of sorrow beyond which his art\ncould not go. Having exhausted his powers of emotional expression he was at a loss to portray the\nfather's face as it deserved, and solved the problem\nby veiling his head and leaving his sorrow to the\nimagination of the spectator.   Sallust did something similar when he wrote  It\nhas always, therefore, been my custom not to tie myself down to  or  rules (this being the\nnearest equivalent I can find for the Greek ). For rules are rarely of such a kind that their\nvalidity cannot be shaken and overthrown in some\n\n\n\nparticular or other.   But I must reserve each of these\npoints for fuller treatment in its proper place. For\nthe present I will only say that I do not want young\nmen to think their education complete when they\nhave mastered one of the small text-books of which\nso many are in circulation, or to ascribe a talismanic\nvalue to the arbitrary decrees of theorists. the art\nof speaking can only be attained by hard work and\nassiduity of study, by a variety of exercises and repeated trial, the highest prudence and unfailing\nquickness of judgement.   But rules are helpful all the\nsame so long as they indicate the direct road and do\nnot restrict us absolutely to the ruts made by others.\nFor he who thinks it an unpardonable sin to leave the\nold, old track, must be content to move at much the\nsame speed as a tight-rope walker. Thus, for example,\nwe often leave a paved military road to take a short\ncut or, finding that the direct route is impossible\nowing to floods having broken down the bridges, are\nforced to make a circuit, while if our house is on fire\nand flames bar the way to the front door, we make\nour escape by breaking through a party wall.   The\norator's task covers a large ground, is extremely\nvaried and develops some new aspect almost every\nday, so that the last word on the subject will never\nhave been said.

For the\ndispute turns either on the quality of the thing\nitself or on the meaning of the words in which it\nis defined. The first and chief disagreement on the\nsubject is found in the fact that some think that\neven bad men may be called orators, while others,\nof whom I am one, restrict the name of orator and\nthe art itself to those who are good.   Of those who\ndivorce eloquence from that yet fairer and more desirable title to renown, a virtuous life, some call\nrhetoric merely a power, some a science, but not a\nvirtue, some a practice, some an art, though they will\nnot allow the art to have anything in common with\nscience or virtue, while some again call it a perversion of art or    These persons have as a\nrule held that the task of oratory lies in persuasion\nor speaking in a persuasive manner: for this is\nwithin the power of a bad man no less than a good.\nHence we get the common definition of rhetoric as\nthe power of persuading. What I call a power,\nmany call a capacity, and some a faculty. In order\ntherefore that there may be no misunderstanding I\nwill say that by power I mean    This view\nis derived from Isocrates, if indeed the treatise on\n\n\n\nrhetoric which circulates under his name is really\nfrom his hand. He, although far from agreeing\nwith those whose aim is to disparage the duties of\nan orator, somewhat rashly defined rhetoric as\n the : for\nI cannot bring myself to use the peculiar derivative\nwhich Ennius applies to Marcus Cethegus in the\nphrase  the \n   Again Gorgias,in the dialogue of Plato that takes\nits title from his name, says practically the same\nthing, but Plato intends it to be taken as the opinion\nof Gorgias, not as his own. Cicero in more than\none passage defined the duty of an orator as    In his  too,\na work which it is clear gave him no satisfaction, he\nmakes the end to be persuasion. But many other\nthings have the power of persuasion, such as money,\ninfluence, the authority and rank of the speaker, or\neven some sight unsupported by language, when\nfor instance the place of words is supplied by the\nmemory of some individual's great deeds, by his\nlamentable appearance or the beauty of his person.\n   Thus when Antonius in the course of his defence of\nManius Aquilius tore open his client's robe and revealed the honourable scars which he had acquired\nwhile facing his country's foes, he relied no longer\non the power of his eloquence, but appealed directly\nto the eyes of the Roman people. And it is believed\nthat they were so profoundly moved by the sight as\nto acquit the accused.   Again there is a speech of\nCato, to mention no other records, which informs us\nthat Servius Galba escaped condemnation solely by\n\n\n\nthe pity which he aroused not only by producing his\nown young children before the assembly, but by\ncarrying round in his arms the son of Sulpicius\nGallus.   So also according to general opinion Phryne\nwas saved not by the eloquence of Hyperides, admirable as it was, but by the sight of her exquisite\nbody, which she further revealed by drawing aside\nher tunic. And if all these have power to persuade, the end of oratory, which we are discussing,\ncannot adequately be defined as persuasion.   Consequently those who, although holding the same\ngeneral view of rhetoric, have regarded it as the\n pride themselves on\ntheir greater exactness of language. This definition\nis given by Gorgias, in the dialogue mentioned\nabove, under compulsion from the inexorable logic of\nSocrates. Theodectes agrees with him, whether the\ntreatise on rhetoric which has come down to us\nunder his name is really by him or, as is generally\nbelieved, by Aristotle. In that work the end of\nrhetoric is defined as the \n   But even this definition is not sufficiently comprehensive, since others besides orators persuade by\nspeaking or lead others to the conclusion desired, as\nfor example harlots, flatterers and seducers. On\nthe other hand the orator is not always engaged on\npersuasion, so that sometimes persuasion is not his\nspecial object, while sometimes it is shared by\nothers who are far removed from being orators.   And\nyet Apollodorus is not very far off this definition\nwhen he asserts that the first and all-important task\nof forensic oratory is  For\n\n\n\neven Apollodorus makes the orator the sport of fortune by refusing him leave to retain his title if he\nfails to persuade.   Some on the other hand pay no\nattention to results, as for example Aristotle, who\nsays  This definition has not merely\nthe fault already mentioned, but the additional defect of including merely the power of invention,\nwhich without style cannot possibly constitute\noratory.   Hermagoras, who asserts that its end is to\n and others who express the same\nopinion, though in different words, and inform us\nthat the end is to  have been sufficiently\nanswered above, when I proved that persuasion was\nnot the privilege of the orator alone.   Various additions\nhave been made to these definitions. For some hold\nthat rhetoric is concerned with everything, while\nsome restrict its activity to politics. The question\nas to which of these views is the nearer to the truth\nshall be discussed later in its appropriate place.   Aristotle seems to have implied that the sphere of the\norator was all-inclusive when he defined rhetoric as\nthe  so too does Patrocles who omits the words  but\nsince he excludes nothing, shows that his view is\nidentical. For he defines rhetoric as the  These definitions like that quoted above include no more than\nthe power of  alone. Theodorus avoids this\nfault and holds that it is the    But, while others besides\n\n\n\norators may discover what is credible as well as persuasive, by adding the words  he, to a\ngreater extent than the others, concedes the fairest\nname in all the world to those who use their gifts as\nan incitement to crime   . Plato makes Gorgias say\nthat he is a master of persuasion in the law-courts\nand other assemblies, and that his themes are justice\nand injustice, while in reply Socrates allows him the\npower of persuading, but not of teaching.   Those\nwho refused to make the sphere of oratory allinclusive, have been obliged to make somewhat forced\nand long-winded distinctions: among these I may\nmention Ariston, the pupil of the Peripatetic Critolaus, who produced the following definition,    Being a Peripatetic he\nregards it as a science, not, like the Stoics, as a\nvirtue, while in adding the words  he inflicts a positive insult on\noratory, in implying that it is not likely to persuade the\nlearned. The same criticism will apply to all those who\nrestrict oratory to political questions, for they exclude thereby a large number of the duties of an\norator, as for example panegyric, the third department of oratory, which is entirely ignored.   Turning\nto those who regard rhetoric as an art, but not as a\nvirtue, we find that Theodorus of Gadara is more\ncautious. For he says (I quote the words of his\ntranslators),    Similarly Cornelius Celsus defines the end of rhetoric as\n\n\n\n Similar definitions are given by\nothers, such for instance as the following:   There are countless other definitions,\neither identical with this or composed of the same\nelements, which I shall deal with when I come to\nthe questions concerned with the subject matter of\nrhetoric. Some regard it as neither a power, a\nscience or an art; Critolaus calls it the  (for this is the meaning of ),\nAthenaeus styles it the    while the\nmajority, content with reading a few passages from\nthe Gorgias of Plato, unskilfully excerpted by\nearlier writers, refrain from studying that dialogue\nand the remainder of Plato's writings, and thereby\nfall into serious error. For they believe that in\nPlato's view rhetoric was not an art, but a certain\n   or with reference to another passage the\n and the  For Plato assigns two departments of politics to the body, namely medicine and\ngymnastic, and two to the soul, namely law and\njustice, while he styles the art of cookery a form of\nflattery of medicine, the art of the slave-dealer a\nflattery of gymnastic, for they produce a false complexion by the use of paint and a false robustness\nby puffing them out with fat: sophistry he calls a\ndishonest counterfeit of legal science, and rhetoric of\njustice.   All these statements occur in the  and\nare uttered by Socrates who appears to be the\n\n\n\nmouthpiece of the views held by Plato. But some of his\ndialogues were composed merely to refute his\nopponents and are styled  while others are\nfor the purpose of teaching and are called \n   Now it is only rhetoric as practised in their own day\nthat is condemned by Plato or Socrates, for he\nspeaks of it as : rhetoric in itself he regards as a\ngenuine and honourable thing, and consequently the\ncontroversy with Gorgias ends with the words,    To this Gorgias\nmakes no reply, but the argument is taken up by\nPolus, a hot-headed and headstrong young fellow,\nand it is to him that Socrates makes his remarks\nabout  and  Then\nCallicles, who is even more hot-headed, intervenes,\nbut is reduced to the conclusion that  It is clear therefore that\nPlato does not regard rhetoric as an evil, but holds\nthat true rhetoric is impossible for any save a just\nand good man. In the    he makes it even\nclearer that the complete attainment of this art is\nimpossible without the knowledge of justice, an\nopinion in which I heartily concur. Had this not\nbeen his view, would he have ever written the\nApology of Socrates or the Funeral Oration in\npraise of those who had died in battle for their\ncountry, both of them works falling within the\nsphere of oratory.   It was against the class of men\nwho employed their glibness of speech for evil purposes that he directed his denunciations. Similarly\nSocrates thought it incompatible with his honour to\n\n\n\nmake use of the speech which Lysias composed for\nhis defence, although it was the usual practice in\nthose days to write speeches for the parties concerned to speak in the courts on their own behalf,\na device designed to circumvent the law which forbade the employment of advocates.   Further the\nteachers of rhetoric were regarded by Plato as quite\nunsuited to their professed task. For they divorced\nrhetoric from justice and preferred plausibility to\ntruth, as he states in the    Cornelius Celsus\nseems to have agreed with these early rhetoricians,\nfor he writes  and again a little later  If this were true, only the worst of men\nwould place such dangerous weapons at the disposal\nof criminals or employ the precepts of their art for\nthe assistance of wickedness.

If\nour definition of rhetoric as the science of speaking\nwell implies that an orator must be a good man,\nthere can be no doubt about its usefulness.   And\nin truth that god, who was in the beginning, the\nfather of all things and the architect of the universe,\ndistinguished man from all other living creatures\nthat are subject to death, by nothing more than\nthis, that he gave him the gift of speech.   For as\nregards physical bulk, strength, robustness, endurance or speed, man is surpassed in certain cases by\ndumb beasts, who also are far more independent of\nexternal assistance. They know by instinct without\nneed of any teacher how to move rapidly, to feed\nthemselves and swim.   Many too have their bodies\nclothed against cold, possess natural weapons and\nhave not to search for their food, whereas in all\nthese respects man's life is full of toil. Reason\nthen was the greatest gift of the Almighty, who\nwilled that we should share its possession with the\nimmortal gods.   But reason by itself would help us\nbut little and would be far less evident in us, had\nwe not the power to express our thoughts in speech;\nfor it is the lack of this power rather than thought\n\n\n\nand understanding, which they do to a certain extent possess, that is the great defect in other living\nthings.   The construction of a soft lair, the weaving\nof nests, the hatching and rearing of their young, and\neven the storing up of food for the coming winter,\ntogether with certain other achievements which we\ncannot imitate, such as the making of honey and\nwax, all these perhaps indicate the possession of a\ncertain degree of reason; but since the creatures that\ndo these things lack the gift of speech they are called\ndumb and unreasoning beasts.   Finally, how little\nthe heavenly boon of reason avails those who are\nborn dumb. If therefore we have received no fairer\ngift from heaven than speech, what shall we regard\nas so worthy of laborious cultivation, or in what\nshould we sooner desire to excel our fellow-men,\nthan that in which mankind excels all other living\nthings?   And we should be all the more eager to do\nso, since there is no art which yields a more grateful\nrecompense for the labour bestowed upon it. This\nwill be abundantly clear if we consider the origins\nof oratory and the progress it has made; and it is\ncapable of advancing still further.   I will not stop\nto point out how useful and how becoming a task it is\nfor a good man to defend his friends, to guide the\nsenate by his counsels, and to lead peoples or armies\nto follow his bidding; I merely ask, is it not a\nnoble thing, by employing the understanding which\nis common to mankind and the words that are used\nby all, to win such honour and glory that you seem\nnot to speak or plead, but rather, as was said of\nPericles, to thunder and lighten?"}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "17"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "1"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}], "pb": {"@id": "p.327"}, "note": {"hi": [{"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Inv."}, {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Ars\nrhetorica, Ars Hermagorae,"}], "#text": "I. v. 6.

Otherwise we might deny the title of art to medicine,\nwhich was discovered from the observation of\nsickness and health, and according to some is\nentirely based upon experiment: wounds were bound\nup long before medicine developed into an art, and\nfevers were reduced by rest and abstention from food,\nlong before the reason for such treatment was\n\n\n\nknown, simply because the state of the patient's\nhealth left no choice.   So too building should not be\nstyled an art; for primitive man built himself a hut\nwithout the assistance of art. Music by the same\nreasoning is not an art; for every race indulges in\nsome kind of singing and dancing. If therefore any\nkind of speech is to be called eloquence, I will admit\nthat it existed before it was an art.   If on the other\nhand not every man that speaks is an orator and\nprimitive man did not speak like an orator, my\nopponents must needs acknowledge that oratory is\nthe product of art and did not exist before it. This\nconclusion also rules out their argument that men\nspeak who have never learnt how to speak, and that\nwhich a man does untaught can have no connexion\nwith art.   In support of this contention they adduce\nthe fact that Demades was a waterman and Aeschines\nan actor, but both were orators. Their reasoning is\nfalse. For no man can be an orator untaught and it\nwould be truer to say that these orators learned\noratory late in life than that they never learned at all;\nalthough as a matter of fact Aeschines had an\nacquaintance with literature from childhood since his\nfather was a teacher of literature, while as regards\nDemades, it is quite uncertain that he never studied\nrhetoric and in any case continuous practice in\nspeaking was sufficient to bring him to such proficiency as he attained: for experience is the best of all\nschools.   On the other hand it may fairly be asserted\nthat he would have achieved greater distinction, if he\nhad received instruction: for although he delivered\nhis speeches with great effect, he never ventured to\nwrite them for others.   Aristotle, it is true, in his\n produces some tentative arguments to\n\n\n\nthe contrary, which are marked by characteristic\ningenuity. On the other hand he also wrote three\nbooks on the art of rhetoric, in the first of which\nhe not merely admits that rhetoric is an art, but\ntreats it as a department of politics and also of\nlogic.   Critolaus and Athenodorus of Rhodes have\nproduced many arguments against this view, while\nAgnon renders himself suspect by the very title of\nhis book in which he proclaims that he is going to\nindict rhetoric. As to the statements of Epicurus\non this subject, they cause me no surprise, for he is\nthe foe of all systematic training."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "16"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "17"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "18"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "19"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "23"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "24"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "25"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "26"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "27"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "28"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "29"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "30"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "31"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "32"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "33"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "34"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "35"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "36"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.335"}, {"@id": "p.337"}, {"@id": "p.339"}, {"@id": "p.341"}], "note": ["See Livy, XXII. xvi.", "Probably a king of Sparta, 770720 B.C.", {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "Ann."}, "#text": "Ennius,  483 (Vahlen)."}], "quote": "Still let me steer\nstraight on!", "#text": "These gentlemen talk a great deal, but the\narguments on which they base their statements are\nfew. I will therefore select the most important of\nthem and will deal with them briefly, to prevent the\ndiscussion lasting to all eternity.   Their first contention is based on the subject-matter; for they\nassert that all arts have their own subject-matter\n(which is true) and go on to say that rhetoric has\nnone, which I shall show in what follows to be false.\n   Another slander is to the effect that no art will\nacquiesce in false opinions: since an art must be\nbased on direct perception, which is always true:\nnow, say they, rhetoric does give its assent to false\nconclusions and is therefore not an art.   I will admit\nthat rhetoric sometimes substitutes falsehood for\ntruth, but I will not allow that it does so because its\nopinions are false, since there is all the difference\nbetween holding a certain opinion oneself and\npersuading someone else to adopt an opinion. For\ninstance a general frequently makes use of falsehood: Hannibal when hemmed in by Fabius\npersuaded his enemy that he was in retreat by\n\n\n\ntying brushwood to the horns of oxen, setting fire\nto them by night and driving the herds across\nthe mountains opposite. But though he deceived\nFabius, he himself was fully aware of the truth.\n   Again when the Spartan Theopompus changed\nclothes with his wife and escaped from custody\ndisguised as a woman, he deceived his guards,\nbut was not for a moment deceived as to his own\nidentity. Similarly an orator, when he substitutes\nfalsehood for the truth, is aware of the falsehood\nand of the fact that he is substituting it for the\ntruth.   He therefore deceives others, but not himself. When Cicero boasted that he had thrown\ndust in the eyes of the jury in the case of\nCluentius, he was far from being blinded himself.\nAnd when a painter by his artistic skill makes us\nbelieve that certain objects project from the picture,\nwhile others are withdrawn into the background, he\nknows perfectly well that they are really all in the\nsame plane.   My opponents further assert that every\nart has some definite goal towards which it directs its\nefforts, but that rhetoric as a rule has no such goal,\nwhile at other times it professes to have an aim, but\nfails to perform its promise. They lie: I have already\nshown that rhetoric has a definite purpose and have\nexplained what it is.   And, what is more, the orator\nwill always make good his professions in this respect,\nfor he will always speak well. On the other hand\nthis criticism may perhaps hold good as against those\nwho think persuasion the end of oratory. But our\norator and his art, as we define it, are independent of\nresults. The speaker aims at victory, it is true, but if\nhe speaks well, he has lived up to the ideals of his art,\neven if he is defeated.   Similarly a pilot will desire\n\n\n\nto bring his ship safe to harbour; but if he is swept\nout of his course by a storm, he will not for that\nreason cease to be a pilot, but will say in the wellknown words of the old poet    So too the doctor seeks to heal the\nsick; but if the violence of the disease or the refusal\nof the patient to obey his regimen or any other\ncircumstance prevent his achieving his purpose, he\nwill not have fallen short of the ideals of his art,\nprovided he has done everything according to reason.\nSo too the orator's purpose is fulfilled if he has spoken\nwell. For the art of rhetoric, as I shall show later,\nis realised in action, not in the result obtained.   From\nthis it follows that there is no truth in yet another\nargument which contends that arts know when they\nhave attained their end, whereas rhetoric does not.\nFor every speaker is aware when he is speaking well.\nThese critics also charge rhetoric with doing what\nno art does, namely making use of vices to serve its\nends, since it speaks the thing that is not and excites\nthe passions.   But there is no disgrace in doing\neither of these things, as long as the motive be good:\nconsequently there is nothing vicious in such action.\nEven a philosopher is at times permitted to tell a lie,\nwhile the orator must needs excite the passions, if\nthat be the only way by which he can lead the\njudge to do justice.   For judges are not always\nenlightened and often have to be tricked to prevent\nthem falling into error. Give me philosophers as\njudges, pack senates and assemblies with philosophers,\nand you will destroy the power of hatred, influence,\nprejudice and false witness; consequently there will\nbe very little scope for eloquence whose value will\nlie almost entirely in its power to charm.   But if, as is\n\n\nthe case, our hearers are fickle of mind, and truth is\nexposed to a host of perils, we must call in art to aid\nus in the fight and employ such means as will help\nour case. He who has been driven from the right road\ncannot be brought back to it save by a fresh detour.\n   The point, however, that gives rise to the greatest\nnumber of these captious accusations against rhetoric,\nis found in the allegation that orators speak indifferently on either side of a case. From which they\ndraw the following arguments: no art is self-contradictory, but rhetoric does contradict itself; no art\ntries to demolish what itself has built, but this does\nhappen in the operations of rhetoric; or again:\nrhetoric teaches either what ought to be said or what\nought not to be said; consequently it is not an art\nbecause it teaches what ought not to be said, or\nbecause, while it teaches what ought to be said, it\nalso teaches precisely the opposite.   Now it is obvious\nthat all such charges are brought against that type\nof rhetoric with which neither good men nor virtue\nherself will have anything to do; since if a case be\nbased on injustice, rhetoric has no place therein and\nconsequently it can scarcely happen even under the\nmost exceptional circumstances that an orator, that\nis to say, a good man, will speak indifferently on either\nside.   Still it is in the nature of things conceivable\nthat just causes may lead two wise men to take\ndifferent sides, since it is held that wise men may fight\namong themselves, provided that they do so at the\nbidding of reason. I will therefore reply to their\ncriticisms in such a way that it will be clear that these\narguments have no force even against those who concede the name of orator to persons of bad character.\nFor rhetoric is not self-contradictory.   The conflict is\n\n\n\nbetween case and case, not between rhetoric and\nitself. And even if persons who have learned the\nsame thing fight one another, that does not prove\nthat what they have learned is not an art. Were\nthat so, there could be no art of arms, since gladiators\ntrained under the same master are often matched\nagainst each other;   nor would the pilot's art exist,\nbecause in sea-fights pilots may be found on different\nsides; nor yet could there be an art of generalship,\nsince general is pitted against general. In the same\nway rhetoric does not undo its own work. For the\norator does not refute his own arguments, nor does\nrhetoric even do so, because those who regard persuasion as its end, or the two good men whom chance has\nmatched against one another seek merely for probabilities: and the fact that one thing is more credible\nthan another, does not involve contradiction between\nthe two.   There is no absolute antagonism between\nthe probable and the more probable, just as there is\nnone between that which is white and that which is\nwhiter, or between that which is sweet and that\nwhich is sweeter. Nor does rhetoric ever teach that\nwhich ought not to be said, or that which is contrary\nto what ought to be said, but solely what ought to be\nsaid in each individual case.   But though the orator\nwill as a rule maintain what is true, this will not\nalways be the case: there are occasions when the\npublic interest demands that he should defend what\nis untrue."}, {"hi": {"@rend": "italics", "#text": "de Oratore:"}, "note": "II. vii. 30.", "quote": [{"pb": {"@id": "p.343"}, "#text": "Art deals\nwith things that are known.

He, thanks to\nhis length of days, for he lived to a hundred and nine,\nflourished as the contemporary of many rhetoricians,\nwas consequently the rival of those whom I have\njust mentioned, and lived on to survive Socrates.\n   In the same period flourished Thrasymachus of\nChalcedon, Prodicus of Ceos, Protagoras of Abdera,\nfor whose instructions, which he afterwards published\nin a text-book, Euathlus is said to have paid 10,000\ndenarii, Hippias of Elis and Alcidamas of Elaea whom\nPlato calls Palamedes.   There was Antiphon also,\nwho was the first to write speeches and who also wrote\na text-book and is said to have spoken most eloquently in his own defence; Polycrates, who,   as\nhave already said, wrote a speech against Socrates,\nand Theodorus of Byzantium, who was one of those\ncalled  by Plato.

These\nrhetoricias had many successors, but the most\nfamous of (Gorgias' pupils was Isocrates, although\nour authorities are not agreed as to who was his\nteacher: I however accept the statement of Aristotle\non the subject.   From this point the roads begin to\npart. The pupils of Isocrates were eminent in every\nbranch of study, and when he was already advanced\nin years (and he lived to the age of ninety-eight),\nAristotle began to teach the art of rhetoric in his\nafternoon lectures, in which he frequently quoted\nthe wel-known line from the  in the form\n\n\n\nBoth Aristotle and Isocrates left text-books on\nrhetoric, but that by Aristotle is the larger and contains more books. Theodectes, whose work I mentioned above,   also lived about the same period: while\nTheophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle, produced some\ncareful work on rhetoric. After him we may note\nthat the philosophers, more especially the leaders of\nthe Stoic and Peripatetic schools, surpassed even\nthe rhetoricians in the zeal which they devoted to\nthe subject.   Hermagoras next carved out a path of\nhis own, which numbers have followed: of his rivals\nAthenaeus seems to have approached him most\n\n\n\nnearly. Later still much work was done by Apollonius Molon, Areus, Caecilius and Dionysius of\nHalicarnassus.   But the rhetoricians who attracted\nthe most enthusiastic following were Apollodorus of\nPergamus, who was the instructor of Augustus Caesar\nat Apollonia, and Theodorus of Gadara, who preferred\nto be called Theodorus of Rhodes: it is said that\nTiberius Caesar during his retirement in that island\nwas a constant attendant at his lectures.   These\nrhetoricians taught different systems, and two schools\nhave arisen known as the Apollodoreans and the\nTheodoreans, these names being modelled on the\nfashion of nomenclature in vogue with certain schools\nof philosophy. The doctrines of Apollodorus are\nbest learned from his pupils, among whom Cains\nValgius was the best interpreter of his master's views\nin Latin, Atticus in Greek. The only text-book by\nApollodorus himself seems to be that addressed to\nMatius, as his letter to Domitius does not acknowledge the other works attributed to him.

The\nGreeks call this essential   a name which\nthey hold was not invented by Hermagoras, but\naccording to some was introduced by Naucrates, the\npupil of Isocrates, according to others by Zopyrus of\nClazomenae, although Aeschines in his speech against\nCtesiphon seems to employ the word, when he asks\nthe jury not to allow Demosthenes to be irrelevant\nbut to keep him to the  or  of the case.  The term seems to be derived from the fact that it\nis on it that the first collision between the parties to\nthe dispute takes place, or that it forms the  of the whole case. So much for the origin of\nthe name. Now for its nature. Some have defined\nthe  as being the  The\nidea is correct, but the expression is faulty.   For the\nessential  is not the first conflict, which we may\nrepresent by the clauses  and  It is rather the\nkind of question which arises from the first conflict,\n\n\n\nwhich we may represent as follows. \n  or    It is clear\nfrom these examples, that the first sort of question\ndepends on  the second on  and\nthat the contending parties rest their respective cases\non these points: the  of these questions will\ntherefore be of a  or  character\nrespectively.   Suppose it should be asserted that\nsound is the conflict between two bodies, the statement would in my opinion be erroneous. For sound\nis not the actual conflict, but a result of the conflict.\nThe error is, however, of small importance: for the\nsense is clear, whatever the expression. But this\ntrivial mistake has given rise to a very serious error\nin the minds of those who have not understood what\nwas meant: for on reading that the essential  was\nthe first conflict, they immediately concluded that the\n was always to be taken from the first question,\nwhich is a grave mistake.   For every question has\nits  since every question is based on assertion by\none party and denial by another. But there are some\nquestions which form an essential part of causes, and\nit is on these that we have to express an opinion;\nwhile others are introduced from without and are,\nstrictly speaking, irrelevant, although they may\ncontribute something of a subsidiary nature to the\ngeneral contention. It is for this reason that there\nare said to be several questions in one matter of\ndispute.   Of these questions it is often the most\ntrivial which occupies the first place. For it is a\nfrequent artifice to drop those points in which we\nplace least confidence, as soon as we have dealt with\nthem; sometimes we make a free gift of them to our\n\n\n\nopponents, while sometimes we are content to use\nthem as a step to arguments which are of greater\nimportance.   A simple cause, however, although it\nmay be defended in various ways, cannot have more\nthan one point on which a decision has to be given,\nand consequently the  of the cause will be that\npoint which the orator sees to be the most important\nfor him to make and on which the judge sees that he\nmust fix all his attention. For it is on this that the\ncause will stand or fall. On the other hand questions\nmay have more  than one.   A brief example\nwill show what I mean. When the accused says\n he\nmakes the  one of  but when he adds  he introduces an element of\n But denial of the facts is always the\nstronger line of defence, and therefore I conceive the\n to reside in that which I should say, if I were\nconfined to one single line of argument.

Still I should say that the \nwas to be found in the latter as being the stronger of\nthe two.   Again in the case of Milo I do not consider\nthat the conflict is raised by the opening questions, but\nonly when the orator devotes all his powers to prove that\nClodius lay in wait for Milo and was therefore rightly\nkilled. The point on which above all the orator must\nmake up his mind, even although he may be going to\n\n\n\ntake up various lines of argument in support of his\ncase, is this: what is it that he wishes most to impress\nupon the mind of the judge?

I also think there\nis at times some doubt as to which  should be\nadopted, when many different lines of defence are\nbrought to meet a single charge; and, just as in regard to the complexion to be given to the statement\nof the facts of the case, that complexion is said to be\nthe best which the speaker can best maintain, so in\nthe present connexion I may say that the best \nto choose is that which will permit the orator to develop a maximum of force.   It is for this reason that\nwe find Cicero and Brutus taking up different lines\nin defence of Milo. Cicero says that Clodius was\njustifiably killed because he sought to waylay Milo,\nbut that Milo had not designed to kill him; while\nBrutus, who wrote his speech merely as a rhetorical\nexercise, also exults that Milo has killed a bad citizen.\n   In complicated causes, however, two or three  may\nbe found, or different  for instance a man may\nplead that he did not do one thing, and that he was\njustified in doing another, or to take another similar\nclass of case, a man may deny two of the charges.\n   The same thing occurs when there is a question\nabout some one thing which is claimed by a number\n\n\n\nof persons, who may all of them rely on the same\nkind of plea (for instance, on the right of the next of\nkin), or may put in different claims, one urging that\nthe property was left him by will, another that he is\nnext of kin. Now whenever a different defence has\nto be made against different claimants, there must be\ndifferent  as for example the well-known controversial theme:     is the Greek word for a bastard;\nLatin, as Cato emphasized in one of his speeches, has\nno word of its own and therefore borrows the foreign\nterm. But I am straying from the point.   The son\nwho was made heir by the will finds his way barred\nby the law  The  is one resting on\nthe  and  and the problem is\nwhether he can inherit by any means at all? can he\ndo so in accordance with the intention of his father?\nor in virtue of the fact that he was made heir by the\nwill? The problem confronting the bastard is twofold, since he was born after the two legitimate sons\n\n\n\nand was not born before a legitimate son.   The first\nproblem involves a syllogism: are those sons who\nhave been cast out from their own family to be regarded as though they had never been born? The\nsecond is concerned with the letter of the law and\nintention. For it is admitted that he was not born\nbefore any legitimate son, but he will defend his\nclaim by appealing to the intention of the law, which\nhe will maintain to imply that the bastard, born when\nthere was no legitimate son in the family, should\nrank as legitimate.   He will dismiss the letter of the\nlaw, pointing out that in any case the position of a\nbastard is not prejudiced by the fact that no legitimate\nson was born after him, and arguing as follows:\n   It need disturb no one\nthat one law should originate two  The law is\ntwofold, and therefore has the force of two laws.\nTo the son who desires to re-enter the family, the\ndisinherited's first reply is, \nThe  will be the same as in the claim put forward\nby the disinherited son, since the question at issue is\nwhether a disinherited son can inherit.   Both the\ndisinherited and the bastard will object,  But in this connexion each will rely on\nhis own particular question.

With regard to things preceding a\nman's birth, there are his country, his parents and his\nancestors, a theme which may be handled in two\nways. For either it will be creditable to the objects of\nour praise not to have fallen short of the fair fame of\ntheir country and of their sires or to have ennobled\na humble origin by the glory of their achievements.   Other topics to be drawn from the period preceding\ntheir birth will have reference to omens or prophecies foretelling their future greatness, such as the\noracle which is said to have foretold that the son of\nThetis would be greater than his father.   of the individual himself will be based on his\ncharacter, his physical endowments and external\ncircumstances. Physical and accidental advantages\nprovide a comparatively unimportant theme, which\nrequires variety of treatment. At times for instance\n\n\n\nwe extol beauty and strength in honorific terms, as\nHomer does in the case of Agamemnon and\nAchilles; at times again weakness may contribute\nlargely to our admiration, as when Homer says that\nTydeus was small of stature but a good fighter.\n   Fortune too may confer dignity as in the case of\nkings and princes (for they have a fairer field for\nthe display of their excellences) but on the other\nhand the glory of good deeds may be enhanced by\nthe smallness of their resources. Moreover the\npraise awarded to external and accidental advantages\nis given, not to their possession, but to their honourable employment.   For wealth and power and influence, since they are the sources of strength, are the\nsurest test of character for good or evil; they make us\nbetter or they make us worse.   Praise awarded to\ncharacter is always just, but may be given in various\nways. It has sometimes proved the more effective\ncourse to trace a man's life and deeds in due chronological order, praising his natural gifts as a child, then\nhis progress at school, and finally the whole course of\nhis life, including words as well as deeds. At times\non the other hand it is well to divide our praises,\ndealing separately with the various virtues, fortitude, justice, self-control and the rest of them and\nto assign to each virtue the deeds performed under\nits influence.

It is not always possible to deal with\nthe time subsequent to our hero's death: this is\ndue not merely to the fact that we sometimes praise\nhim, while still alive, but also that there are but few\noccasions when we have a chance to celebrate the\naward of divine honours, posthumous votes of thanks,\nor statues erected at the public expense.   Among\nsuch themes of panegyric I would mention monuments of genius that have stood the test of time.\nFor some great men like Menander have received\nampler justice from the verdict of posterity than\nfrom that of their own age. Children reflect glory\non their parents, cities on their founders, laws on\nthose who made them, arts on their inventors and\ninstitutions on those that first introduced them; for\ninstance Numa first laid down rules for the worship\nof the gods, and Publicola first ordered that the\nlictors' rods should be lowered in salutation to the\npeople."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "19"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "20"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "21"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "22"}], "note": ["the handsomest warrior among the Greeks of Troy.", "Son of Atreus: the allusion is not known.", "Moses."], "pb": {"@id": "p.475"}, "#text": "The same method will be applied to denunciations\nas well, but with a view to opposite effects.

I can find no place for the last. For however great the violence which may threaten us, it may\nbe necessary for us to suffer something, but we are not\ncompelled to do anything; whereas the subject of\ndeliberation is primarily whether we shall do anything.\n   Or if by necessity they mean that into which we are\ndriven by fear of worse things, the question will be one\nof expediency. For example, if a garrison is besieged\nby overwhelmingly superior forces and, owing to the\nfailure of food and water supplies, discusses surrender\nto the enemy, and it is urged that it is a matter of\nnecessity, the words  must\nneeds be added: consequently there is no necessity\narising out of the circumstances themselves, for death\nis a possible alternative. And as a matter of fact the\nSaguntines did not surrender, nor did those who were\nsurrounded on the raft from Opitergium.   It follows\nthat in such cases also the question will be either one\nof expediency alone or of a choice between expediency and honour.  it will be urged,  Certainly. But he who wishes to\nbecome a father must needs be quite clear that he\nmust take a wife.   It appears to me, therefore, that\nwhere necessity exists, there is no room for deliberation, any more than where it is clear that a thing is\n\n\n\nnot feasible. For deliberation is always concerned\nwith questions where some doubt exists. Those\ntherefore are wiser who make the third consideration\nfor deliberative oratory to be  or \nas we translate it; the translation may seem clumsy,\nbut it is the only word available.   That all these\nconsiderations need not necessarily obtrude themselves in every case is too obvious to need explanation.\nMost writers, however, say that there are more than\nthree. But the further considerations which they\nwould add are really but  of the three \nconsiderations just mentioned. For right, justice,\npiety, equity and mercy (for thus they translate \n), with any other virtues that anyone may be\npleased to add, all come under the heading of that\nwhich is honourable.   On the other hand, if the question\nbe whether a thing is easy, great, pleasant or free from\ndanger, it comes under questions of expediency. Such\ntopics arise from some contradiction; for example a\nthing is expedient, but difficult, or trivial, or unpleasant, or dangerous.   Some however hold that at\ntimes deliberation is concerned solely with the question\nwhether a thing is pleasant, as for instance when discussion arises as to whether a theatre should be built or\ngames instituted. But in my opinion you will never\nfind any man such a slave to luxury as not to consider\nanything but pleasure when he delivers an advisory\nspeech.   For there must needs be something on every\noccasion that takes precedence of pleasure: in proposing the institution of public games there is the honour\ndue to the gods; in proposing the erection of a\ntheatre the orator will consider the advantages to be\nderived from relaxation from toil, and the unbecoming\nand undesirable struggle for places which will arise if\n\n\n\nthere is no proper accommodation; religion, too, has\nits place in the discussion, for we shall describe the\ntheatre as a kind of temple for the solemnization of a\nsacred feast.   Often again we shall urge that honour\nmust come before expediency; as for instance when\nwe advise the men of Opitergium not to surrender to\nthe enemy, even though refusal to do so means\ncertain death. At times on the other hand we prefer\nexpediency to honour, as when we advise the arming\nof slaves in the Punic War.   But even in this case we\nmust not openly admit that such a course is dishonourable: we can point out that all men are free by\nnature and composed of the same elements, while\nthe slaves in question may perhaps be sprung\nfrom some ancient and noble stock; and in the\nformer case when the danger is so evident,\nwe may add other arguments, such as that they\nwould perish even more cruelly if they surrendered,\nshould the enemy fail to keep faith, or Caesar (a\nmore probable supposition) prove victorious.   But\nin such a conflict of principles it is usual to modify\nthe names which we give them. For expediency is\noften ruled out by those who assert not merely that\nhonour comes before expediency, but that nothing\ncan be expedient that is not honourable, while others\nsay that what we call honour is vanity, ambition and\nfolly, as contemptible in substance as it is fair in\nsound.   Nor is expediency compared merely with\ninexpediency. At times we have to choose between\ntwo advantageous courses after comparison of their\nrespective advantages. The problem may be still\nmore complicated, as for instance when Pompey\ndeliberated whether to go to Parthia, Africa or\nEgypt. In such a case the enquiry is not which of\n\n\n\ntwo courses is better or worse, but which of three or\nmore.   On the other hand in  oratory there\nwill never be any doubt about circumstances wholly\nin our favour. For there can clearly be no doubt about\npoints against which there is nothing to be said.\nConsequently as a rule all  speeches are\nbased simply on comparison, and we must consider\nwhat we shall gain and by what means, that it may be\npossible to form an estimate whether there is more\nadvantage in the aims we pursue or greater disadvantage in the means we employ to that end.   A\nquestion of expediency may also be concerned with\ntime (for example, )\nor with place () or\nwith particular persons ( or ) or with our method of\naction () or with\ndegree ()."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "36"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "37"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "38"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "39"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "40"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "41"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "43"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "44"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "45"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "46"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "47"}], "pb": [{"@id": "p.499"}, {"@id": "p.501"}, {"@id": "p.503"}], "quote": ["Do you\nthen teach that this should be done or think it\nright?", "Should I be\na good man to advise this?

Consequently,\nthough examples are of the greatest value in\ndeliberative speeches, because reference to historical parallels is the quickest method of securing assent, it matters a great deal whose authority\nis adduced and to whom it is commended. For\nthe minds of those who deliberate on any subject differ from one another and our audience may\nbe of two kinds.   For those who ask us for advice are either single individuals or a number, and\nin both cases the factors may be different. For\nwhen advice is asked by a number of persons it\nmakes a considerable difference whether they are\n\n\nthe senate or the people, the citizens of Rome or\nFidenae, Greeks or barbarians, and in the case of\nsingle individuals, whether we are urging Cato or\nGaius Marius to stand for office, whether it is the\nelder Scipio or Fabius who is deliberating on his plan\nof campaign.   Further sex, rank, and age, must be\ntaken into account, though it is character that will\nmake the chief difference. It is an easy task to\nrecommend an honourable course to honourable\nmen, but if we are attempting to keep men of bad\ncharacter to the paths of virtue, we must take care\nnot to seem to upbraid a way of life unlike our own.  The minds of such an audience are not to be moved\nby discoursing on the nature of virtue, which they\nignore, but by praise, by appeals to popular opinion,\nand if such vanities are of no avail, by demonstration\nof the advantage that will accrue from such a policy,\nor more effectively perhaps by pointing out the\nappalling consequences that will follow the opposite\npolicy.   For quite apart from the fact that the minds\nof unprincipled men are easily swayed by terror, I\nam not sure that most men's minds are not more\neasily influenced by fear of evil than by hope of\ngood, for they find it easier to understand what is\nevil than what is good.   Sometimes again we urge\ngood men to adopt a somewhat unseemly course,\nwhile we advise men of poor character to take a\ncourse in which the object is the advantage of\nthose who seek our advice. I realise the thought\nthat will immediately occur to my reader:  Cicero might clear me from blame in the\nmatter; for he writes to Brutus in the following\nterms, after setting forth a number of things that\n\n\n\nmight honourably be urged on Caesar:  However, this is a\nsomewhat abstruse question, and does not concern\ndeliberative oratory alone. I shall therefore reserve\nit for my twelfth and concluding book.   For my part\nI would not have anything done dishonourably. But\nfor the meantime let us regard these questions as at\nleast belonging to the rhetorical exercises of the\nschools: for knowledge of evil is necessary to enable\nus the better to defend what is right.   For the\npresent I will only say that if anyone is going to urge\na dishonourable course on honourable man, he\nshould remember not to urge it as being dishonourable, and should avoid the practice of certain declaimers who urge Sextus Pompeius to piracy just\nbecause it is dishonourable and cruel. Even when we\naddress bad men, we should gloss over what is unsightly. For there is no man so evil as to wish to\nseem so.   Thus Sallust makes Catiline speak as one\nwho is driven to crime not by wickedness but by indignation, and Varius makes Atreus say:\n\n\n\nHow much more has this pretence of honour to be\nkept up by those who have a real regard for their\nown good name!   Therefore when we advise Cicero\nto beg Antonius for mercy or even to burn the\n if Antonius promises to spare him on that\ncondition, we shall not empliasise the love of life in\nour advice (for if that passion has any force with\n\n\n\nhim, it will have it none the less if we are silent),\nbut we shall exhort him to save himself in the interest of the state.   For he needs some such reason\nas that to preserve him from feeling shame at entreating such a one as Antony. Again if we urge\nGaius Caesar to accept the crown we shall assert\nthat the state is doomed to destruction unless controlled by a monarchy.

For\nthe same speaker has on one occasion to impersonate\nCaesar, on another Cicero or Cato. But it is a most\nuseful exercise because it demands a double effort\nand is also of the greatest use to future poets and\nhistorians, while for orators of course it is absolutely\nnecessary.   For there are many speeches composed\nby Greek and Latin orators for others to deliver, the\nwords of which had to be adapted to suit the position and character of those for whom they were\n\n\n\nwritten. Do you suppose that Cicero thought in the\nsame way or assumed the same character when he\nwrote for Gnaeus Pompeius and when he wrote for\nTitus Ampius and the rest? Did he not rather bear\nin mind the fortune, rank and achievements of each\nsingle individual and represent the character of all\nto whom he gave a voice so that though they spoke\nbetter than they could by nature, they still might\nseem to speak in their own persons?   For a speech\nwhich is out of keeping with the man who delivers\nit is just as faulty as the speech which fails to suit\nthe subject to which it should conform. It is for\nthis reason that Lysias is regarded as having shown\nthe highest art in the speeches which he wrote for\nuneducated persons, on account of their extraordinary realism. In the case of declaimers indeed it is\nof the first importance that they should consider\nwhat best suits each character: for they rarely play\nthe role of advocates in their declamations. As a\nrule they impersonate sons, parents, rich men, old\nmen, gentle or harsh of temper, misers, superstitious persons, cowards and mockers, so that hardly\neven comic actors have to assume more numerous\nroles in their performances on the stage than\nthese in their declamations.

They have considered deliberative themes to be different and\nabsolutely opposed to forensic themes. For they have\nalways affected abrupt openings, an impetuous style\nand a generous embellishment, as they call it, in their\nlanguage, and have been especially careful to make\nshorter notes for  than for  themes.\n   For my part while I realise that  themes\ndo not require an  for reasons which I have\nalready stated, I do not, however, understand why\nthey should open in such a wild and exclamatory\nmanner. When a man is asked to express his opinion\non any subject, he does not, if he is sane, begin to\nshriek, but endeavours as far as possible to win the\nassent of the man who is considering the question by\na courteous and natural opening.   Why, I ask, in review of the fact that deliberations require moderation\nabove all else, should the speaker on such themes indulge in a torrential style of eloquence kept at one\nhigh level of violence? I acknowledge that in controversial speeches the tone is often lowered in the\n  and the  and\nthat if you subtract these three portions, the remainder is more or less of the  type of\nspeech, but what remains must likewise be of a more\neven flow, avoiding all violence and fury.   With\nregard to manificence of language, deliblerative declaimers should avoid straining after it more than\nothers, but it comes to them more naturally. For\nthere is a preference among those who invent such\nthemes for selecting great personages, such as kings,\nprinces, senators and peoples, while the theme itself\n\n\n\nis generally on a grander scale. Consequently since\nthe words are suited to the theme, they acquire\nadditional splendour from the magnificence of the\nmatter.   In actual deliberations the case is different,\nand consequently Theophrastus laid it down that in\nthe  class of oratory the language should\nas far as possible be free from all affectation: in\nstating this view he followed the authority of his instructor, although as a rule he is not afraid to differ\nfrom him. For Aristotle   held that the \ntype of oratory was the best suited for writing and\nthat the next best was  oratory: his reason for\nthis view was that the first type is entirely concerned\nwith display, while the second requires art, which\nwill even be employed to deceive the audience, if\nexpedience should so demand, whereas advice requires\nonly truth and prudence.   I agree with this view as\nregards  oratory (in fact all writers are\nagreed on this point), but as regards  and  themes I think that the style must be suited to\nthe requirements of the subject which has to be treated.\n   For I notice that the  of Demosthenes\nare pre-eminent for the same merits as his forensic\nspeeches, and that the opinions expressed by Cicero\nbefore the senate or the people are as remarkable for\nthe splendour of their eloquence as the speeches\nwhich he delivered in accusing or defending persons\nbefore the courts. And yet Cicero says of  oratory that the whole speech should be simple\nand dignified, and should derive its ornament rather\nfrom the sentiments expressed than the actual words.\n   As regards the use of examples practically all authorities are with good reason agreed that there is no\nsubject to which they are better suited, since as a\n\n\n\nrule history seems to repeat itself and the experience\nof the past is a valuable support to reason.

In  subjects however it\nmust be taken in two senses: first in the sense in\nwhich we say that a controversial matter involves\nmany questions, thereby including all minor questions; secondly in the sense of the main question on\nwhich the case turns. It is of this, with which the\n originates, that I am now speaking. We ask\nwhether a thing has been done, what it is that has\nbeen done, and whether it was rightly done.   To these Hermagoras and Apollodorus and many other\nwriters have given the special name of \nTheodorus on the other hand, as I have already said,\ncalls them  while he designates minor\nquestions or questions dependent on these  as  For it is agreed that question\nmay spring from question, and species be subdivided\ninto other species.   This main question, then, they\ncall the  The  is the method by\nwhich an admitted act is defended. I see no reason\nwhy I should not use the same example to illustrate\nthis point that has been used by practically all my\npredecessors. Orestes has killed his mother: the\nfact is admitted. He pleads that he was justified in\nso doing: the  will be one of quality, the\n whether he was justified in his action, the\n that Clytemnestra killed her husband,\nOrestes' father. This is called the  or \n\n\n\nThe point for the decision of the judge is known as\nthe  and in this case is whether it was\nright that even a guilty mother should be killed by\nher son.   Some have drawn a distinction between\n and  making  mean the cause of the\ntrial, namely the murder of Clytemnestra,  the\nmotive urged in defence, namely the murder of\nAgamemnon. But there is such lack of agreement\nover these two words, that some make  the cause\nof the trial and  the motive of the deed, while\nothers reverse the meanings. If we turn to Latin\nwriters we find that some have given these causes the\nnames of  the beginning, and  the reason,\nwhile others give the same name to both.   Moreover\n seems to spring from  or as the Greeks say\n as will be seen from the following:\nClytemnestra killed Agamemnon, because he had\nsacrificed their daughter and brought home a captive\nwoman as his paramour. The same authors think\nthat there may be several  to one\n for instance Orestes may urge that he\nkilled his mother because driven to do so by oracles.\nBut the number of \nwill be the same as the number of alleged  for\nthe deed: in this case it will be whether he ought to\nhave obeyed the oracles.   But one alleged  may\nalso in my opinion involve several questions and several\npoints for the decision of the judge, as for instance\nin the case when the husband caught his wife in\nadultery and slew her and later slew the adulterer,\nwho had escaped, in the market place. The  is\nbut one:  But there arise\nas  and  whether\n\n\n\nit was lawful to kill him at that time and at that\nplace.

As for\nthe  the  as I have mentioned\nit is called by some, or the  as it is called by\nothers, or as Cicero styles it  some regard it as being the point after which\nall enquiry ceases, others as the main point for\nadjudication.   The  of the deed does not arise\nin all controversial cases. For how can there be a\n for the deed, when the deed is denied? But\nwhen the  for the deed does come up for\ndiscussion, they deny that the  rests on the same ground as  and this view is maintained by Cicero in his\nRhetorica and    For when it has been\nasserted and denied that a deed was done, the question whether it was done is resolved by  and\nthe  and the  rest on\nthe same ground, since the first question and the\nfinal decision are concerned with the same point.\nBut when it is stated and denied that Orestes was\njustified in killing his mother, considerations of \nare introduced: the  is whether he was justified in killing her, but this is not yet the point for the\n When, then, does it become so?\n  The\n is whether it was his\nduty to kill her.   As regards the  I will put\n\n\n\nit in the words of Cicero himself:   Others again use illustrations such as the following:  The\n is whether everyone that spends his patrimony\nis to be prohibited, while the \nwhether he who spent it in such a way is to be\nprohibited.   Or again take the case of the soldier\nArruntius, who killed the tribune Lusius for assaulting\nhis honour. The  is whether he was justified\nin so doing,  that the murdered man\nmade an assault upon his honour,  whether it was right that a man\nshould be killed uncondemned or a tribune by a\nsoldier.   Some even regard the  of the \nas being different from the  of the \nThe  as to whether Milo was justified in\nkilling Clodius, is one of  The  namely whether Clodius lay in\nwait for Milo, is a matter for    They also\nurge that a case is often diverted to the consideration\nof some matter irrelevant to the  and that it is\non this matter that judgment is given.

But the shorter method, which for that\nvery reason is also by far the most lucid, will not\nfatigue the learner by leading him through a maze of\ndetail, nor destroy the coherence of his eloquence by\nbreaking it up into a number of minute departments.\nFor he who has a clear view of the main issue of a dispute, and divines the aims which his own side and his\nopponents intend to follow and the means they intend\nto employ (and it is to the intentions of his own side\nthat he must pay special attention), will without a\ndoubt be in possession of a knowledge of all the points\nwhich I have discussed above.   And there is hardly\nanyone, unless he be a born fool without the least\nacquaintance with the practice of speaking, who does\n\n\n\nnot know what is the main issue of a dispute (or as\nthey call it the  or ) and what is\nthe  between the parties and the  these three being identical.\nFor the  is concerned with the matter in dispute and the  is given on the\npoint involved in the    Still we do not keep\nour attention rigidly fixed on such details, but the\ndesire to win praise by any available means and the\nsheer delight in speaking make us wander away from\nthe subject, since there is always richer material for\neloquence outside the strict theme of the case, inasmuch as the points of any given dispute are always\nfew, and there is all the world outside, and in the one\ncase we speak according to our instructions, in the\nother on the subjects of our own choice.   We should\nteach not so much that it is our duty to discover the\n  and the  (an easy task), as that we should\ncontinually keep our attention on our subject, or if\nwe digress, at least keep looking back to it, lest in\nour desire to win applause we should let our weapons\ndrop from our grasp.
