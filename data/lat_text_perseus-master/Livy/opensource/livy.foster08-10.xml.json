Ogulnii accordingly proposed a law, that whereas there were then four augurs and four pontiffs and it was desired to augment the number of priests, four pontiffs and five augurs should be added, and should all be taken from the\n\t\t\t\t\t plebs. How this college could have been reduced to four augurs, unless by the death of two, I cannot discover; since it is a settled principle amongst the augurs that their number should be uneven, to the end that the three ancient tribes, the Ramnes, Titienses and Luceres, should each have its augur, or else\n\t\t\t\t\t if a larger number should be needed that they should increase the priests in the same proportion; as in fact they were increased when five were added to the four, and, making up the number of nine, gave each tribe\n\t\t\t\t\t three. But since they were to be added from the plebs, the patricians were as distressed by the proposal as they had been when they saw the consulship thrown\n\t\t\t\t\t open.  pretended that' the gods were more concerned than they themselves were: the gods would see to it that their rites should not be contaminated; for their own part they only hoped that no disaster might come upon the\n\t\t\t\t\t state.  made, however, no great struggle, accustomed as they now were to being worsted in contests of this kind; and they beheld their adversaries no longer reaching out after great honours which they had formerly scarce any hopes of attaining, but in full possession of all the things for which they had striven with dubious prospects of success repeated consulships, censorships, and triumphs."}, {"milestone": [{"@unit": "chapter", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "2"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "3??"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "4"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "5"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "6"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "7"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "8"}], "reg": ["there", "after", "or", "did", "who", "let", "he"], "note": [{"date": {"@value": "-367", "#text": "367 B.C."}, "#text": "Enacted  (vi. xxxv. 5)."}, "Prescribed in the ceremony of devotion, as in certain others.", {"@type": "margin", "#text": "B.C. 300"}], "name": "Publius", "pb": {"@id": "p.383"}, "#text": "is said, however, to have been a vigorous discussion as to the passage or rejection of the bill, in which Appius Claudius and Publius Decius Mus were the principal speakers.\n\t\t\t\t\t  they had brought up nearly the same arguments concerning the rights of patricians and plebeians as had formerly been employed in behalf of and against the Licinian Law, when the plebeians sought access to the consulship, it\n\t\t\t\t\t is related that Decius evoked the image of his father as he had been seen by many who were then present in the assembly, wearing his toga with the Gabine cincture, and standing over his weapon, as he had done when offering himself a sacrifice for the Roman People and the legions.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Decius the consul had on that occasion seemed to the immortal gods an oblation no less pure and holy than if his colleague Titus Manlius had been offered up; could not then this same Publius Decius he asked have been duly chosen to solemnize the public sacrifices of the Roman People?\n\t\t\t\t\t  was it to be feared that the gods would hearken less readily to the speaker's prayers than to those of Appius Claudius?
